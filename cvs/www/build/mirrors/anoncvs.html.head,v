<p>

Anonymous CVS is a method of keeping your local copy of the OpenBSD source
tree up to date with respect to changes made to current OpenBSD sources.
In addition to following the bleeding edge of development, it is
also possible to track the <a href="faq/faq10.html#Patches">errata patches</a>
of a release.

<p>
Anonymous CVS works directly against a central source code repository.
This means that you have the full set of CVS commands available to control
merging and updating your changes with other source changes, performing diffs,
change histories and other queries against the central repository.
In the event that the changes can't be completely merged, CVS provides annotated
changes to your local copy and preserves an unmodified copy of your version.

<p>
The OpenBSD Project currently has four active source repositories:

<ul>
  <li><b>src</b> - source code for the base system
  <li><b>ports</b> - the <a href="faq/ports">ports tree</a>
  <li><b>www</b> - web pages
  <li><b>xenocara</b> - xenocara
</ul>

<h3 id="CVS">What is CVS?</h3>

<a href="https://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/cvs">CVS</a> is the
source code control system used to manage the OpenBSD source tree.
It implements a central repository for all officially released source code
and changes, while permitting developers to maintain local copies of the
source code with their working changes.

There are two levels of source tree access:

<ul>
<li>Read-write access for developers
<li>Read-only access for everyone
</ul>

<h3 id="starting">Pre-loading the source tree</h3>

While you can download the entire source tree from an AnonCVS server, you can
save time and bandwidth by pre-loading your tree with the source tarballs.
This is particularly true if you are running
<a href="stable.html"><i>-stable</i></a>, as relatively few files change
between the <i>-release</i> and <i>-stable</i>.

<p>
The source files for download from the <a href="ftp.html">mirrors</a> are
separated into two files to reduce the download time for those wishing to
work with only one part of the tree.
The kernel sources are in <tt>sys.tar.gz</tt> and the userland sources
are in <tt>src.tar.gz</tt>.

<p>
The following commands assume you have followed
<a href="faq/faq5.html#wsrc">these instructions</a> to give a non-root
user write access to the src, ports and xenocara directories.

<blockquote><pre>
$ <b>cd /usr/src</b>
$ <b>tar xzf /tmp/src.tar.gz</b>
$ <b>tar xzf /tmp/sys.tar.gz</b>
$ <b>cd /usr</b>
$ <b>tar xzf /tmp/ports.tar.gz</b>
$ <b>tar xzf /tmp/xenocara.tar.gz</b>
</pre></blockquote>

<h3 id="using">Using CVS to get and update your source trees</h3>

<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/cvs">cvs(1)</a> was designed to be a simple way
to retrieve and update your sources.
You must first decide whether you want to track <i>-current</i> or a
<a href="stable.html"><i>-stable</i></a> branch.
The current tree has all of the up to the minute changes, whereas the
<i>-stable</i> branch contains the sources for the release plus the patches from
the <a href="errata.html">errata</a> and lesser issues already applied.
For more information on the flavors of OpenBSD, see 
<a href="faq/faq5.html#Flavors">here</a>.

<p>
Choose the Anonymous CVS server you are going to use from the
<a href="#CVSROOT">list of servers</a> below, then you can start using cvs.
If you begin with <tt>src.tar.gz</tt> and <tt>sys.tar.gz</tt> as mentioned
above, you can skip the initial <tt>get</tt> and proceed to updating.


<p>
<b>Warning:</b>
When using cvs, you should take care that your current directory is either the
root of the tree you are referencing or in a separate place such as
<tt>/tmp</tt>.
Some commands, such as <tt>cvs get</tt>, can create an arbitrary sub-tree in the
current directory, and a subsequent update will recursively flesh out this
sub-tree.

<h4 id="getting">Getting an initial tree</h4>

The following commands assume that your user is member of the <tt>wsrc</tt>
group:

<p>
If you are following <i>-current</i>:

<blockquote><pre>
$ <b>cd /usr</b>
$ <b>cvs -qd anoncvs@@anoncvs.ca.openbsd.org:/cvs get -P src</b>
</pre></blockquote>

If you are following the 6.1 <i>-stable</i> branch:

<blockquote><pre>
$ <b>cd /usr</b>
$ <b>cvs -qd anoncvs@@anoncvs.ca.openbsd.org:/cvs get -rOPENBSD_6_1 -P src</b>
</pre></blockquote>
<!-- DO NOT EDIT ANONCVS.HTML MANUALLY - IT IS GENERATED FROM TEMPLATES! -->

Anonymous CVS uses passwordless SSH as a transport.
If this is the first time you have connected to an anoncvs server,
you will be asked to confirm the SSH fingerprint to ensure that you
are connecting to the expected server:

<blockquote><pre>
$ <b>cvs -d anoncvs@@anoncvs.spacehopper.org:/cvs get -P src</b>
The authenticity of host 'anoncvs.spacehopper.org (2001:67c:15f4:a423::28)' can't be established.
ED25519 key fingerprint is SHA256:oaJ7VEyjt2EHMeixzKn9zJGiV5YlWHIUls070tKdBzI.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?
</pre></blockquote>

In most cases, the list below includes the fingerprints for the server,
so you can compare it against the displayed fingerprint as additional
verification that you are connecting to the correct server.
Confirm this, and the fingerprint will then be saved as usual.

<blockquote><pre>
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? <b>yes</b>
Warning: Permanently added 'anoncvs.spacehopper.org' (ED25519) to the list of known hosts.
</pre></blockquote>

<h4 id="updating">Updating an existing tree</h4>

If you are following <i>-current</i>:

<blockquote><pre>
$ <b>cd /usr/src</b>
$ <b>cvs -q up -Pd</b>
</pre></blockquote>

If you are following the 6.1 <i>-stable</i> branch:

<blockquote><pre>
$ <b>cd /usr/src</b>
$ <b>cvs -q up -rOPENBSD_6_1 -Pd</b>
</pre></blockquote>

Every time you run this, cvs(1) synchronizes your <tt>/usr/src</tt> tree.
It does not destroy any of your local changes; rather it attempts to merge
changes in.

<h4>Changing the server</h4>

If you are updating a source tree that you initially fetched
from a different server, or from a tar file, you <b>must</b>
add the <em>-d [cvsroot]</em> option to cvs.

<blockquote><pre>
$ <b>cd /usr/src</b>
$ <b>cvs -d anoncvs@@anoncvs.ca.openbsd.org:/cvs -q up -Pd</b>
</pre></blockquote>

<h4>Getting the ports and xenocara trees</h4>

Make sure your user is member of the <tt>wsrc</tt> group and that
<tt>/usr/ports</tt> is group writable by <tt>wsrc</tt>.
Replace <tt>ports</tt> with <tt>xenocara</tt> throughout to get or update a
xenocara tree.

<ul><li>

<p>
If you are following <i>-current</i>:

<blockquote><pre>
$ <b>cd /usr</b>
$ <b>cvs -qd anoncvs@@anoncvs.ca.openbsd.org:/cvs get -P ports</b>
</pre></blockquote>

If you are following the 6.1 <i>-stable</i> branch:

<blockquote><pre>
$ <b>cd /usr</b>
$ <b>cvs -qd anoncvs@@anoncvs.ca.openbsd.org:/cvs get -rOPENBSD_6_1 -P ports</b>
</pre></blockquote>

<li> Any time afterwards, to update this tree:

<p>
If you are following <i>-current</i>:

<blockquote><pre>
$ <b>cd /usr/ports</b>
$ <b>cvs -q up -Pd</b>
</pre></blockquote>

If you are following the 6.1 <i>-stable</i> branch:

<blockquote><pre>
$ <b>cd /usr/ports</b>
$ <b>cvs -q up -rOPENBSD_6_1 -Pd</b>
</pre></blockquote>

</ul>

<h4>Creating a diff</h4>

To make a diff of a locally patched module (here <tt>cd.c</tt>) to include with
a bug report:

<blockquote><pre>
$ <b>cd /usr</b>
$ <b>cvs diff -u src/sys/scsi/cd.c &gt; /tmp/patch</b>
</pre></blockquote>

<h3 id="EXAMPLE">Example usage for cvs(1)</h3>

A sample use of an anoncvs server would be:

<blockquote><pre>
$ <b>cd /tmp</b>
$ <b>cvs -d anoncvs@@anoncvs.ca.openbsd.org:/cvs get -P src/sys/arch/sparc</b>
[copies the files from the repository to your machine]
$ <b>cd src/sys/arch/sparc</b>
$ <b>cvs log locore.s</b>
[shows the commit log for the chosen file]
$ <b>cvs diff -bc -r1.1 -r1.5 locore.s</b>
[shows the changes between revisions 1.1 and rev 1.5]
</pre></blockquote>

information about how CVS can be used.

<b>Warning:</b>
When using cvs, you should take care that your current directory is either
the root of the tree you are referencing or in a separate place such as
<tt>/tmp</tt>.
Some commands such as "get" can create an arbitrary sub-tree in the current
directory, and a subsequent update will recursively flesh out this sub-tree.

The anoncvs service gives fledgling developers a chance to learn CVS
operation and get thoroughly involved in the development process
before getting "commit" access -- as a result of showing useful
skills and high quality results they will naturally later be given
developer access.
As well, people providing patches can create their diffs relative
to the CVS tree, which will ease integration.

The major advantage of Anonymous CVS over other source code update
techniques is that it works directly against a central source code
repository or mirror.  This means that you have the full set of CVS
commands available to control merging and updating your changes with
other source changes, performing diffs, change histories and other
queries against the central repository.
d53 1
a53 14
To summarize, the real strength of using Anonymous CVS is that it is
a "tolerant" source code control system - it <b>respects</b>
changes that you have made to your local sources and makes <b>
"best efforts"</b> to update your entire source tree, rather than
leaving you a list of arcane problems that have to be resolved before
continuing.

<p>
In the event that the changes can't be completely merged, CVS provides a
"soft fallback", providing you with annotated changes to your
local copy, preserving an unmodified copy of your version and continuing
to update any other source modules you requested.

While you can download the entire source tree from an anoncvs server,
you can often save a lot of time and bandwidth by "preloading" your
source tree with the source files from either the OpenBSD CD or from an
FTP server.
d77 5
a81 19
To extract the source tree from the CD to <i>/usr/src</i> (assuming the CD is 
mounted on /mnt):

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>cd /usr/src</b>
# <b>tar xzf /mnt/src.tar.gz</b>
# <b>cd /usr</b>
# <b>tar xzf /mnt/xenocara.tar.gz</b>
# <b>tar xzf /mnt/ports.tar.gz</b>
</pre></blockquote>

The source files for download from the FTP servers are separated into two
files to minimize the time required to download for those wishing to work
with only one part of the tree.  The two files are <tt>sys.tar.gz</tt>,
which contains the files used to create the kernel, and <tt>src.tar.gz</tt>
which contains all the other "userland" utilities.
In general, however, you will usually want both of them installed.
Assuming the downloaded files, <tt>src.tar.gz</tt>,
<tt>sys.tar.gz</tt> and <tt>xenocara.tar.gz</tt> are in <tt>/tmp</tt>:
d92 1
a92 13
Not all people will wish to unpack all the file sets, but as the system
must be kept in sync, you will generally need to set up all trees.

<p>
You can also just use cvs(1) to "<b>checkout</b>" the source repository
for you. This is discussed in the <a href="#using">next section</a>.

<p>
After this, <tt>/usr/src</tt> will be a nice checkout area where all
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/cvs">cvs(1)</a> commands will work properly.

<h3><a name="CRYPTO"><font color="#0000e0">Getting crypto sources through 
cvs(1)</font></a></h3>

<p>
<strong>IMPORTANT NOTE:</strong>
There are a few issues relating to cryptographic software that everyone
should be aware of:
<ul>
<li>The OpenBSD sources are from Canada.
As
	<a href="http://www.efc.ca/pages/doc/crypto-export.html">
	researched by a Canadian individual</a>
and as
	<a href="http://axion.physics.ubc.ca/ECL.html">
	described in the Export Control list of Canada</a>
it is legal to export crypto software from Canada to the world.
<p>
<li>However, if you are outside the USA or Canada, you should not
fetch the cryptographic sections of the OpenBSD sources from an
anoncvs server located in the USA.
Because of US Dept. of Commerce policy, crypto software may only
be exported to Canada from the USA.
</ul>
