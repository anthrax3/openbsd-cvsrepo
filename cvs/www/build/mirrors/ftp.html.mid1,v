@Adjust ftp list generation to include https URLs (not previously shown here),
putting them first in the list, and suppressing the http version for those sites.
beck@@ deraadt@@ liked it, tweaks suggested by tj@@ tb@@ - I've incorporated some,
they may want to tweak some more but this seems a good starting point.

@mirrors will be managed by a framework similar to that of groups/support
and pkg-stable from now on.  In this commit, introduce the tools and the
mirror database.  At the moment, we are capable of generating ftp.html
(FTP/HTTP/RSYNC mirrors).  This will soon be extended to doing the rest
of the mirror pages, ftplist, and also the mirrors of the subprojects that
want to use this database.

Help, discussion and ok steven@@, and no protest from other www people
