<p>
The file structure of each server is roughly:
</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li><strong>/pub/OpenBSD/</strong><br>
	Absolute path for HTTP(s) and FTP mirrors where the OpenBSD FTP
	collection <strong>must</strong> be available. This location

	<p>
<li><strong>/pub/OpenBSD/6.0/</strong><br>

  <li><strong>luna88k/</strong>
  <li><strong>macppc/</strong>
  <li><strong>octeon/</strong>
  <li><strong>packages/</strong><br>
       Binary packages (pre-compiled ports) to install on your -release
       or -stable system. These are frozen at release time and not updated.
  <li><strong>sgi/</strong>
  <li><strong>sparc64/</strong>
  <li><strong>src.tar.gz<br></strong>
	Userland sources, which you would place in /usr/src.
  <li><strong>sys.tar.gz<br></strong>

  <li><strong>ports.tar.gz<br></strong>
	Ports sources, which you would place in /usr/ports.
  <li><strong>xenocara.tar.gz<br></strong>
	X Window System sources, which you would place in /usr/xenocara.
  </ul>
<p>
<li><strong>/pub/OpenBSD/snapshots/</strong><br>
	For our major architectures, we frequently build releases
	and binary packages from our development code.
	This is where we place those test releases.
<p>
<li><strong>/pub/OpenBSD/tools/</strong><br>
    Various other little bits.
<li><strong>/pub/OpenBSD/5.9/</strong><br>

<li><strong>/pub/OpenBSD/5.8/</strong><br>
    Layout is similar to the 6.0 release described above.. for the nostalgic.
</ul>

<p id=prospective>
To be listed on this page we require mirrors to be fast, up to date,
capable, and well-connected to networks in the region in which they serve.
<p>
Mirrors must carry the following:
<ul>
  <li>OS and packages for <strong>all architectures</strong>
  <li>at least the <strong>last two releases</strong> in binary form
  <li><strong>up-to-date snapshots</strong> (no older than a week)
  <li><strong>all associated directories</strong>
    <br>(including OpenSSH/, OpenNTPD/, OpenBGPD/, patches/ and tools/)
</ul>
In addition:
<ul>
  <li>serve files from the /pub/OpenBSD path
  <li>use a second-level mirror as an upstream
</ul>
As of 6.0, the minimum space required is approximately 600GB.
However, to reduce problems when snapshot packages are updated, it is
recommended to use the rsync options "--delete-delay --delay-updates"
which will use additional space.
"--fuzzy" may also be helpful to reduce the amount of data transferred
when updating snapshot packages.
Depending on the disk space available, mirrors may provide more contents,
such as older releases, current source tree, etc.
<p>
A suggested <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/httpd.conf">httpd.conf(5)</a>
configuration for <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/httpd">httpd(8)</a>
that is suitable for being www and ftp space mirror is <a href="httpd.conf">here</a>.
<p>
Operators of mirrors who are interested in having their site added to
the list on this page should contact <a
href="mailto:mirrors-discuss@@openbsd.org">mirrors-discuss@@openbsd.org</a>
with further details about their site, including network connectivity,
geographic location, and general information.
We will suggest a suitable second-level mirror to sync from;
<b>do not</b> mirror from ftp.openbsd.org.
<p>
Mirror operators should subscribe to the low-volume
<a href="mail.html#Mirrors">mirrors-announce</a> mailing list.

Our policy requires mirrors to carry at least the last two releases in
binary form (currently 6.0 and 5.9), snapshots, as well as the other
associated directories (including OpenSSH/, OpenNTPD/, OpenBGPD/,
patches/ and tools/), and keep them current; snapshots should not be
older than a week.
Use the rsync options "--delete-delay", "--delay-updates" and "--fuzzy"
when updating your mirror.
Note that in the above, "release" means <b>all files</b> under the specific
directory.
This includes all architecture subdirectories and the complete packages
subdirectory, with packages for all application architectures.

People setting up new FTP/<a href="anoncvs.html">ANONCVS</a> mirrors
will be interested in the following information.
<br>
To be listed on this page we require fast, up-to-date, capable mirrors,
well-connected to networks in the region in which they serve.
a126 2
Mirror operators should subscribe to the low-volume
<a href="mail.html#Mirrors">mirrors-announce</a> mailing list.
a130 1
<br>
a132 39
<br>
The current disk space usage on the master ftp site,
<a href="ftp://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/">
<tt>ftp://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/</tt></a>,
is as follows:
<pre>

                      current
pub/OpenBSD/4.5       65.0GB   (OpenBSD 4.5 release)
pub/OpenBSD/4.6       73.1GB   (OpenBSD 4.6 release)
pub/OpenBSD/4.7       81.9GB   (OpenBSD 4.7 release)
pub/OpenBSD/snapshots 83.1GB   (current snapshots, normally &gt;= the last
				distribution in size)
pub/OpenBSD/src         .7GB   (ftpable src tree, checked out from anoncvs
				nightly. You should avoid using an ftp mirror
				to get this. It's better to just update it
				yourself with a checkout from a nearby anoncvs
				server.)
</pre>
Hence, a mirror requires about 250GB of disk space at least, for snapshots
and the last two releases.
Depending on which old releases you serve additionally, you can waste
still more disk space.
Note that the master ftp site also provides the following directory, that
you <b>MUST NOT</b> mirror, or you risk losing access to the server you are
mirroring from.
<pre>

pub/OpenBSD/distfiles 40.9GB   (distfiles used by the ports subsystem
				makefiles. <b>Do not mirror these yourself.</b>
				The ports infrastructure only fetches from
				ftp.openbsd.org and ftp.usa.openbsd.org.)

</pre>

If you do wish to provide access to the ports distfiles, this can be
done through the <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=mirroring-ports&sektion=7&apropos=0">mirroring-ports(7)</a>
infrastructure.

this is to ensure all listed mirrors are in a good state of synchronisation

@mirrors will be managed by a framework similar to that of groups/support
and pkg-stable from now on.  In this commit, introduce the tools and the
mirror database.  At the moment, we are capable of generating ftp.html
(FTP/HTTP/RSYNC mirrors).  This will soon be extended to doing the rest
of the mirror pages, ftplist, and also the mirrors of the subprojects that
want to use this database.

Help, discussion and ok steven@@, and no protest from other www people
