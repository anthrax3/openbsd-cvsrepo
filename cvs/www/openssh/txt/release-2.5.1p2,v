@Portable OpenSSH 2.5.1p2 has just been uploaded and will be making its
way to the mirror sites (http://www.openssh.com/portable.html) in due
course.

This release contains primarily bug-fixes over 2.5.1p1 but an upgrade is
recommended. Specific bug-fixes include:

 - Fixed endianess issue causing failues when usin Rijndael/AES cipher
 - Fix PAM failures on Solaris and Linux
 - Fix RPM spec file for Redhat systems
 - Fixed several compatibility functions
 - Fix entropy collection code for SCO3 and NeXTStep
 - Many other minor fixes (see Changelog for details)

This release includes Mark Roth's mdoc2man.pl script which can be used
to fix up the manpages on systems that lack the full andoc set of
macros (e.g. Solaris). A future release of portable OpenSSH will automate
this scripts use for systems that require it.
