<font color="#e00000">Goals</font>
</h2>
<hr>

<p>
Our goal is simple: Since telnet and rlogin are insecure, all
operating systems should ship with support for the SSH protocol
included.
<p>

The SSH protocol is available in two incompatible varieties:
SSH 1 and SSH 2.
<p>

The older SSH 1 protocol comes in two major sub-variants:
protocol 1.3 and protocol 1.5.  Both are supported by OpenSSH, but disabled
at compile time due to their insecurity.
Both of these use the asymmetric cryptography algorithm
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/rsa">RSA</a>
(for which the USA patent has expired, allowing full use by everyone)
for key negotiation, and then use a
short list of symmetric algorithms for data hiding: 
3DES and
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/blowfish">Blowfish</a>.
(There used to be a few other algorithms like RC4, but their 
implementations had even worse security problems).
Some SSH 1 protocol implementations also support the IDEA symmetric
algorithm, but since this algorithm is patented in some nations, OpenSSH
ships without support for IDEA. OpenSSH code including full SSH 1.3 and SSH
1.5 protocol support shipped on December 1, 1999.
<p>

The SSH 1 protocol uses a simple CRC for data integrity, which turns out
to be flawed. An insertion attack is known to be possible, however, due
to a number of bandaids which have been applied to SSH implementations over
the years, attacks against it are very difficult to perform. When the 3DES
cipher is used, the insertion attack is significantly less possible.
<p>

The second major variety of SSH is the SSH 2 protocol.  SSH 2 was
invented to avoid the patent issues regarding RSA (patent issues which
no longer apply, since the patent has expired), to fix the CRC data
integrity problem that SSH1 has, and for a number of other technical
reasons.  By using the asymmetric
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/dsa">DSA</a>
and
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/dh">DH</a>
algorithms,
protocol 2 avoids all patents.  The CRC problem is also solved by
using a real
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/HMAC">HMAC</a>
algorithm. The SSH 2 protocol supports many other choices for symmetric
ciphers, as well as many other new features.
<p>

OpenSSH relies on the <a href="https://www.libressl.org">LibreSSL</a>
library for some of its cryptographic routines, AES-GCM being one example.
<p>

Continuing that trend, the OpenBSD project members who worked on
OpenSSH made a push at supporting the SSH 2 protocol as well.  This
work was primarily done by Markus Friedl.  Around May 4, 2000, the
SSH 2 protocol support was implemented sufficiently to be usable.

<p>

For many of its cryptography features, OpenSSH relies on the non-GPL'd
<a href="http://www.openssl.org">OpenSSL</a> library.
<p>

Almost immediately after we shipped our SSH 1 protocol implementation,
various non-OpenBSD groups got very, very interested.  Damien Miller,
Philip Hands, and handful of others started porting OpenSSH to Linux
and various other Unix operating systems.  From the start of our own
efforts, we have felt that even the original SSH implementation was too
complicated; it simply had too many operating system dependencies to
deal with.  Our approach to writing completely secure and rock solid
code avoids dealing with excessive differences like that.  Thus, to
make the entire development process easier on us all, we decided to
split our core development efforts from portability developments.
This has worked out very well for us.  (As a case in point, compare the
number of lines of code between the baseline and portable versions).

The other SSH variety is protocol 2.  Protocol 2 was invented to avoid
the patent issues regarding RSA (patent issues which no longer apply, since

problem that SSH1 has.  By using the asymmetric

Since then, the OpenBSD project members who work on

So, as of May 4, 2000, OpenSSH provides full protocol 2 support.  But
since protocol 1 clients and servers are still more popular on the
Internet, we also continue to support protocol 1.

Our goal is simple: Operating systems should ship with ssh included.

In under a year, the RSA patent in the USA will expire.  In the meantime,
of course, people outside the USA are already allowed to use RSA patented
code in their software.  So we have a very large testing ground for
getting this wonderful public key cryptography fully integrated into our
operating system.

By the time the patent expires, OpenBSD will be ready to provide
people with tools that use that technology, throughout the operating
system.  OpenSSH is just a small part of that; for more information
see
