@OpenNTPD 5.7p2 has just been released. It will be available from the mirrors
listed at http://www.openntpd.org/ shortly.

OpenNTPD is a FREE, secure, and easy to use implementation of the Network Time
Protocol. It provides the ability to sync the local clock to remote NTP servers
and can act as NTP server itself, redistributing the local clock. 

Changes since OpenNTPD 5.7p1
==========================

 * Switched the drift file from an unscaled frequency offset to ppm.
   The latter format is compatible with the NTP daemon from ntp.org.
   No forward migration steps are necessary.
 * Fixed a memory leak in DNS handler.
 * Added support for setting the process title on Linux and OS X.
 * Added NetBSD support.
 * Various bugfixes and refinements from the community.

For detailed changes, see the changes either in the OpenBSD CVS repository or
the GitHub mirror.
