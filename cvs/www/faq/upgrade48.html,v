<i>Note: Upgrades are only supported from one release to the release
immediately following it.
Do not skip releases.</i>

<p><i>
It is highly recommended that you read through and fully understand
this process before attempting it.
If you are doing it on a critical or physically remote machine, it is
recommended that you test this process on an identical, local system to
verify its success before attempting on a critical or remote computer.
</i>

<p>
Upgrading is a convenient way to bring your OpenBSD system up to the most
recent version.
However, the results are not intended to precisely match the results of
a wipe-and-reload installation.
Old library files in particular are not removed in the upgrade process,
as they may be required by older applications that may or may not be
upgraded at this time.
If you REALLY wish to get rid of all these old files, you are probably
better off reinstalling from scratch.

<h2 id="before">Before upgrading: things to think about and be aware of</h2>
This is <i>not</i> a complete list of the changes that took place
between 4.7 and 4.8, but rather some of the important things that will
impact a large number of users in the upgrade process.
For a more complete list of changes, see
<a href="../plus48.html">plus48.html</a> and the CVS change logs.

<ul>
<li id="softraid">
<b>Softraid metadata change:</b><br>
The metadata format used by
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/softraid.4">softraid(4)</a>
has changed since 4.7.
We had initially warned that this would require a rebuild of softraid(4)
volumes for the 4.7 to 4.8 upgrade, but this is no longer true.
Later improvements enabled backwards compatibility, but at the cost of
being unable to use some of the upcoming future features of softraid(4).
Rebuilding your RAID sets is recommended, but not required.

<p>
<li id="ahci-raid"><b>ahci(4) no longer attaches to RAID-mode disks:</b><br>
To avoid risk of corrupting metadata on certain Intel RAID devices,
ahci(4) no longer attaches to the PCI device IDs used by these
controllers when set to RAID mode.
If your SATA disk is attached to a ahci(4) contoller in RAID mode, it
will "vanish" as part of the upgrade and require resetting the BIOS
controller type to AHCI to get it back.

<p>
<li id="kern"><b>Modified kernel:</b><br>
Check whether you have made any modifications to your kernel.
For example, you might have modified your network device to use a
non-default setting using config(8).
Note your changes, so you can repeat them for the new 4.8 kernel.

</ul>

<p>
<hr>
<h2 id="upgrade">The upgrade process</h2>

<h3>Upgrading by install kernel</h3>
If you have access to the system's console, the easiest and safest way
to upgrade is to boot from install media or
<a href="faq4.html#bsd.rd">bsd.rd</a> and follow the upgrade steps,
which are very similar to the <a href="faq4.html">install process</a>.

<p>
Afterwards, complete the upgrade by following the <a href="#final">final
steps</a> as detailed below.

<p>
One easy way to boot from the install kernel is to place the 4.8 version
of <i>bsd.rd</i> in the root of your boot drive, then instruct the boot loader
to boot using this new <i>bsd.rd</i> file.
On amd64 and i386, you do this by entering "<tt>boot bsd.rd</tt>" at the
initial <tt>boot&gt;</tt> prompt.

<h3>Upgrading without install kernel</h3>
<i>This is NOT the recommended process.  Use the install kernel method
if at all possible!</i>

<p>
Sometimes, one needs to do an upgrade of a machine when one can't easily
use the normal upgrade process.
The most common case is when the machine is in a remote location and you
don't have easy access to the system console.
One can usually do this by carefully following this process:

<ul>
<li><b>Place install files in a "good" location</b>.
Make sure you have sufficient space!

<p>
<li><b>Stop any appropriate applications:</b>
During this process, all the userland applications will be replaced but
may not be runnable, and strange things may happen as a result.
If this is a concern to you, shut down any applications that may
be impacted.
There may be other applications which you wish to keep from running
immediately after the upgrade, stop and disable them as well.

<p>
<li><b>Check the kernel:</b>
Although <b>most people can skip this step</b>, if you had a modified kernel
in 4.7, it is likely you will need to modify the stock kernel of 4.8.
Especially when you are performing the upgrade process remotely, now is
the time to make sure the new kernel will work upon rebooting the machine.
If any changes must be made to the kernel, the safest thing to do is to
make those changes on a local 4.8 system.
This can be as simple as modifying a specific device using config(8),
or it can involve a recompilation if the option you need is not included
in the GENERIC kernel.
Please consult <a href="faq5.html">FAQ 5 - Building the system from source</a>
before deciding to recompile your kernel.

<p>
<li><b>Install new kernel(s):</b>

<ul>
<li>If using a single processor kernel:
<blockquote><pre>
<b>export RELEASEPATH=</b><i>/usr/rel</i>   <i># where you put the files</i>
<b>cd ${RELEASEPATH}</b>
<b>rm /obsd ; ln /bsd /obsd && cp bsd /nbsd && mv /nbsd /bsd</b>
<b>cp bsd.rd bsd.mp /</b>
</pre></blockquote>
(note: you will get a harmless error message if your platform doesn't
have a bsd.mp):
<p>

<li>If you are using the multiprocessor kernel:
<blockquote><pre>
<b>export RELEASEPATH=</b><i>/usr/rel</i>   <i># where you put the files</i>
<b>cd ${RELEASEPATH}</b>
<b>rm /obsd ; ln /bsd /obsd && cp bsd.mp /nbsd && mv /nbsd /bsd</b>
<b>cp bsd.rd /</b>
<b>cp bsd /bsd.sp</b>
</pre></blockquote>
</ul>

<p>
Note the extra steps for copying over the primary kernel: those are done
to ensure that there is always a valid copy of the kernel on the disk
that the system can boot from should there be a really badly timed power
outage or system crash.

<p>
<li><b>Save yourself a copy of the old reboot(1) command:</b>
You are still running the old kernel, it is possible the new reboot
command will not run on the old kernel.

<blockquote><pre>
<b>cp /sbin/reboot /sbin/oreboot</b>
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
<li><b>Install new userland applications.</b>
<i>Do NOT install <tt>etc48.tgz</tt> and <tt>xetc48.tgz</tt> now, because
that will overwrite your current configuration files!</i>
Note that we are installing base48.tgz LAST, because it will include a new
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/tar.1">tar(1)</a>
utility, which may or may not run on the old kernel.
We reboot immediately, as the system is probably barely runnable now.

<blockquote><pre>
<b>tar -C / -xzphf xserv48.tgz</b>
<b>tar -C / -xzphf xfont48.tgz</b>
<b>tar -C / -xzphf xshare48.tgz</b>
<b>tar -C / -xzphf xbase48.tgz</b>
<b>tar -C / -xzphf game48.tgz</b>
<b>tar -C / -xzphf misc48.tgz</b>
<b>tar -C / -xzphf comp48.tgz</b>
<b>tar -C / -xzphf man48.tgz</b>
<b>tar -C / -xzphf base48.tgz</b> # Install last!
<b>/sbin/oreboot</b>
</pre></blockquote>

Not all file sets will need to be installed for all applications,
however if you installed a file set originally, you should certainly
upgrade it with the new file set now.

<p>
Again, the files in <tt>/etc</tt> are handled separately below, so
<tt>etc48.tgz</tt> and <tt>xetc48.tgz</tt> are NOT unpacked here.

<p>
<li><b>After reboot completes, upgrade <tt>/dev</tt>.</b>
The new
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-4.8/i386/MAKEDEV">MAKEDEV</a>
file was copied to /dev by the installation of
<tt>base48.tgz</tt>, so you simply need to do the following:
<blockquote><pre>
<b>cd /dev</b>
<b>./MAKEDEV all</b>
</pre></blockquote>

</ul>

<hr>
<h2 id="final">Final steps</h2>

Whether you upgrade by using an install kernel and doing a formal
"upgrade" process, or do a "in-place" binary upgrade, there are certain
manual steps that have to be performed.

<h3 id="UsersGroups">1. New Users and Groups</h3>
The following users need to be created for 4.8:

<blockquote><pre>
<b>useradd -u 99 -g =uid -c "sndio privsep" -d /var/empty -s /sbin/nologin _sndio
useradd -u 100 -g =uid -c "LDAP Daemon" -d /var/empty -s /sbin/nologin _ldapd
useradd -u 101 -g =uid -c "IKEv2 Daemon" -d /var/empty -s /sbin/nologin _iked</b>
</pre></blockquote>

<h3 id="etcUpgrade">2. Upgrading <tt>/etc</tt></h3>
<p>
You will want to extract the <tt>etc48.tgz</tt> files to a temporary
location:
<blockquote><pre>
<b>export RELEASEPATH=/usr/rel</b>
<b>tar -C /tmp -xzphf ${RELEASEPATH}/etc48.tgz</b>
</pre></blockquote>


Files that can probably be copied from <tt>etc48.tgz</tt> "as is":

<blockquote><pre>
etc/daily
etc/disktab
etc/iked.conf
etc/ksh.kshrc
etc/ldapd.conf
etc/netstart
etc/rc
etc/rc.conf
etc/ldap/*
etc/systrace/usr_sbin_named
var/named/etc/root.hint
</pre></blockquote>

Note that it IS possible to locally modify these files; if this has been
done, do NOT simply copy over those files, and consider using the
<a href="#sysmerge">sysmerge(8) process</a> instead.
<!-- Pay special attention to <tt>mail/*</tt> if you are using something
other than the default Sendmail(8) configuration. -->
Here are copy/paste lines for copying these files, assuming you unpacked
<tt>etc48.tgz</tt> in the above recommended place:

<blockquote><pre>
<b>cd /tmp/etc </b>
<b>mkdir -p /etc/ldap/certs</b>
<b>cp daily disktab iked.conf ksh.kshrc ldapd.conf netstart rc rc.conf /etc</b>
<b>cp systrace/usr_sbin_named /etc/systrace</b>
<b>cp ldap/* /etc/ldap</b>
<b>cp ../var/named/etc/root.hint /var/named/etc</b>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>


<h3 id="patchfile">3a.  Merging locally changed files via a patch file</h3>

<p>
These files likely have local changes, but should be updated for
4.8.  IF you have not altered these files, you can copy over the
new version, otherwise the changes should be merged with your files:

<blockquote><pre>
etc/changelist
etc/ftpusers
etc/mail/aliases
etc/man.conf
etc/newsyslog.conf
etc/remote
etc/services
etc/ssl/x509v3.cnf
etc/sysctl.conf
</pre></blockquote>

The changes to these files are in <a href="upgrade48.patch">this
patch file</a>.
Please test this process before relying on it for a machine you can not
easily get to.
You can attempt to use this by executing the following as root:
<blockquote><pre>
<b>cd /</b>
<b>patch -C -p0 &lt; upgrade48.patch</b>
</pre></blockquote>

This will test the patch to see how well it will apply to YOUR system;
to actually apply it, leave off the "<tt>-C</tt>" option.
Note that it is likely that if you have customized files or not kept
them closely updated, or are upgrading from a snapshot of 4.7, they may
not accept the patch cleanly.
Make sure all file changes are attempted; patch(1) may quit prematurely
if it gets too confused in one file, which may happen if your machine
was originally installed from a snapshot or otherwise has some interim
changes.
The last file to be changed here should be <tt>sysctl.conf</tt>.
Deleting the file sections that fail from the patch file may permit the
rest to be applied.
You will need to manually apply the changes that are skipped.




<p>
The following files have had changes which should be looked at, but it
is unlikely they should be directly copied or merged (i.e., if you are
using pf.conf, look at the suggested change of strategy, and decide if
it is appropriate for your use).

<blockquote><pre>
etc/ldpd.conf
</pre></blockquote>

<p>

Finally, use
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/newaliases.8">newaliases(8)</a>
to update the aliases database,
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/mtree.8">mtree(8)</a>
create any new directories:

<blockquote><pre>
<b>newaliases</b>
<b>mtree -qdef /etc/mtree/4.4BSD.dist -p / -u</b>
</pre></blockquote>

(note that the /etc/mtree files are now part of <tt>base48.tgz</tt>, and
no longer need to be copied from <tt>etc48.tgz</tt> as they did before.)

<h3 id="sysmerge">3b. Merging locally changed files via sysmerge(8)</h3>

<p>
The
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/sysmerge.8">sysmerge(8)</a>
utility will compare the files that are actually on your system with
those that would be installed to a fresh install, and assist you in
merging the changes into your system.
Note that unlike the patch file, there are no assumptions made about
what is actually on your system, so you can use sysmerge(8) to move
between more arbitrary <a href="faq5.html#Flavors">points in the
development process</a>, such as from an earlier <i>-current</i> to
<i>4.8-release</i> or from one <i>-current</i> to a later one.
Sysmerge(8) compares the current files on your system with the files
that would have been installed with a new install, and gives you the
option of keeping the old file, installing the new file, or assisting
you in the manual merging of the old and new files, using
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/sdiff.1">sdiff</a>.
You may opt to use sysmerge to make the changes, or you may wish to use
the patch file first, and then follow up with a sysmerge session to
clean up any loose ends.

<p>
<b>Who should use sysmerge(8):</b><br>
People running highly modified systems or systems that didn't start out
at the previous release (for example, a snapshot partway between
releases), who are upgrading to a snapshot or who have not carefully
upgraded their system in the past will find sysmerge vastly superior to
using the patches, as it works with what is actually on your system,
instead of what we expected was on your system.
It will also give you much greater control over your upgrade process,
and will involve you in it more closely.

<p>
<b>Who may wish to NOT use sysmerge(8):</b><br>
With recent improvements in sysmerge, we hope that relatively few
people have reason not to use sysmerge(8)!

<p>
Please read the
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/sysmerge.8">sysmerge(8)</a>
manual page before using it on your system.
You are also advised to read the
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/diff.1">diff(1)</a>,
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/sdiff.1">sdiff(1)</a>
and even review
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/more.1">more(1)</a>
manual pages before continuing.

<p>
Assuming the <tt>etc48.tgz</tt> and <tt>xetc48.tgz</tt> files exists in
your $RELEASEPATH, run it with:

<blockquote><pre>
<b>sysmerge -s $RELEASEPATH/etc48.tgz -x $RELEASEPATH/xetc48.tgz</b>
</pre></blockquote>

Sysmerge(8) will show you a unified
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/diff.1">diff(1)</a>,
run through your favorite $PAGER (i.e.,
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/more.1">more(1)</a>)
and ask you, for most changed files, if you wish to:
<blockquote><pre>
  Use 'd' to delete the temporary ./var/www/htdocs/index.html
  Use 'i' to install the temporary ./var/www/htdocs/index.html
  Use 'm' to merge the temporary and installed versions
  Use 'v' to view the diff results again

  Default is to leave the temporary file to deal with by hand
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
If you wish to retain your existing file, delete the temporary file, if
you wish to replace your existing file with the new version, install the
temporary file.
If you wish to merge the two together, chosing 'm' will put you into
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/sdiff.1">sdiff(1)</a>,
where you can manually merge the file.
The default is to come back and deal with the file later, manually.

<p>
Sysmerge(8) saves all your replaced files into a temporary directory,
similar to <tt>/var/tmp/sysmerge.24959/backups</tt>, so if you accidentally
clobber something that was probably not such a good idea, you have a chance
to recover it. Note that
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/daily.8">daily(8)</a>
cleans old files from this directory.

<h3 id="RmFiles">4. Files to delete</h3>
A number of files should be deleted from your system.
Note that some of these may not exist on all systems; that's ok.
Copy and paste the following lines:
<blockquote><pre><b>

<h3 id="Kernchk">5. Checking the kernel</h3>
Note: <b>most people can skip this step!</b>
<p>
If you followed the instructions for the upgrade process without install
kernel, you have already completed this step.
However, if you used the install kernel, and if you had a modified kernel
in 4.7, it is likely you will need to modify the stock kernel of 4.8.
This can be as simple as modifying a specific device using config(8),
or it can involve a recompilation if the option you need is not included
in the GENERIC kernel.
Please consult <a href="faq5.html">FAQ 5 - Building the system from source</a>
before considering to recompile your kernel.

<h3 id="Pkgup">6. Upgrading packages</h3>
If you installed any packages on your system, you should upgrade them
after completing the upgrade of the base system.
Be aware, however, many packages will require further setup before
and/or after upgrading the package.
Check with the application's upgrade guide for details.

<p>
The following packages are known to have significant upgrade issues that
will impact a large number of users.
The fact that a package is not on this list doesn't mean it will have a
trivial upgrade.
You must do some homework on the applications YOU use.

<ul>
<li><b>kqemu:</b> Must be kept in sync with the kernel. pkg_delete prior
to the upgrade, then pkg_add the new package once the upgrade has been
completed.

<li><b>Dovecot:</b>
Dovecot has been updated from 1.1.20 to 1.2.11. The configuration file changed
and the old cmusieve plugin has been removed in favor of the new Dovecot sieve
implementation. The
<a href="http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.os.openbsd.ports.cvs/42080">commit
log entry</a> has more details.

<li><b>Samba:</b>
The default user database backend for the Samba port has changed.
If you currently use smbpasswd, you must either adjust your configuration,
or convert your database.
See <a href="http://cvsweb.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/ports/net/samba/files/README.OpenBSD?rev=1.12">README.OpenBSD</a>
for more information.

<li><b>Firefox:</b>
The main mozilla-firefox package was updated
from 3.0 to 3.6.
Although most people will have no problem with the update, some have
seen problems with Firefox not functioning correctly.
In this case it may be necessary to create a new profile:
see /usr/local/mozilla-firefox/README.OpenBSD for more details.
Also note that the Java plugins do not yet support Firefox 3.6;
in this case you should instead use the 3.5 package:
<tt>pkg_add firefox35</tt>.
Both versions of Firefox may be installed in parallel.




</ul>

<p>
The package tools support in-place updating using <tt>pkg_add -u</tt>.
For instance, to update all your packages, make sure <tt>PKG_PATH</tt> is
pointing to the 4.8 packages directory on your CD or nearest FTP mirror,
and use something like

<blockquote><pre>
<b>pkg_add -ui</b>
</pre></blockquote>

where the <tt>-u</tt> indicates update mode, and <tt>-i</tt> specifies
interactive mode, so pkg_add will prompt you for input when it encounters
some ambiguity. Read the
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-4.8/pkg_add">pkg_add(1)</a>
manual page and the <a href="faq15.html#PkgMgmt">package management</a>
chapter of the FAQ for more information.

sysmerge handles users and groups sanely now, so remove this warning,
and it probably reduces or eliminates the reasons to use the patch method.
Figures, 'bout the time I get generating the patch down to a science...

Ready for advanced users to check out.
Still need to flesh out "before upgrading" section and ports sections
before it is ready for general public.

People who have a lot of machines to upgrade that were kept fairly
simple and at the previous release/stable point will probably find the
old patch file system much faster.

While it can work, we do not recommend you use sysmerge to integrate new
users into the system, but rather use the useradd(8) line
<a href="#UsersGroups">above</a>.
We believe it is much less error prone.
(hint: do <i>not</i> <b>i</b>nstall the temporary master.passwd file
over your existing one!).

not all platforms have a bsd.mp, may generate a harmless error.
adjust how <b>s are in place to make page validate.
patch file definitely exists now (and has been tested).
Warn that patch(1) may bail before attempting all files if it gets
confused, so check last file changed.

In those cases, you will need to manually apply the changes.
Please test this process before relying on it for a machine you can not
easily get to.

/etc/ldpd.conf isn't handled as a cp file.
/etc/iked is handled by base48.tgz and mtree, no need to build the tree
here (and this wasn't right, anyway)

ldpd.conf is not a copy-over...or patch.
