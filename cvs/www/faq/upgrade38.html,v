<a href="upgrade39.html">[3.8 -> 3.9]</a>

<p>

<i>Note: Upgrades are only supported from one release to the release
immediately following it.
Do not skip releases.</i>

<p><i>
It is highly recommended that you read through and fully understand
this process before attempting it.
If you are doing it on a critical or physically remote machine, it is
recommended that you test this process on an identical, local system to
verify its success before attempting on a critical or remote computer.
</i>

<p>
Upgrading is a convenient way to bring your OpenBSD system up to the most
recent version.
However, the results are not intended to precisely match the results of
a wipe-and-reload installation.
Old library files in particular are not removed in the upgrade process,
as they may be required by older applications that may or may not be
upgraded at this time.
If you REALLY wish to get rid of all these old files, you would probably
be better off reinstalling from scratch.

<h2>Before upgrading...</h2>
Before upgrading, some users choose to remove all
<a href="faq15.html#PkgMgmt">packages</a>, and installing new versions
after upgrade.
<p>
To quickly remove all packages from your system:
<blockquote><pre>
pkg_delete -q /var/db/pkg/*
</pre></blockquote>
After the upgrade, install the new versions of these applications.

<p>

Note that, with OpenBSD 3.8, the pkg tools now support in-place updating
using <code>pkg_add -r</code>.  This has been checked to work with most
packages, in particular with the CD packages available in 3.6 or 3.7.
Some important points apply:
<ul>
<li><code>pkg_add -r</code>   does not do global updates, but needs to
be told which packages to update.  A new option <code>pkg_add -u</code>
can be used to find out the exact list of packages to pass to
<code>pkg_add -r</code>.
<li><code>pkg_add -r -F update -F updatedepends -q list_of_new_pkgs</code>
should work in most cases.
<li>mozilla packages in 3.7 can now safely be updated to a 3.8 version.
</ul>

<p>
<b>tx(4) driver is now
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/epic.4">epic(4)</a></b>.
If your system has a tx(4) based card (such as SMC EtherPower II 10/100
cards), it will be supported by a different driver on OpenBSD 3.8 than
it was on 3.7.
BEFORE doing the upgrade, copy your <tt>/etc/hostname.tx*</tt> file(s)
to corresponding <tt>/etc/hostname.epic*</tt> files, otherwise you will
not have functioning network during and after the upgrade process.

<h2>Upgrading by install media</h2>
The easiest and safest way to upgrade from binary files is to boot from
install media and follow the upgrade steps, which are very similar to
the <a href="faq4.html">install process</a>.
Afterwards, do the <a href="#etcUpdates"><tt>/etc</tt> updates</a> below.

<h2>Upgrading without install media</h2>
<i>This is not the recommended process.  Use the install media method
if at all possible!</i>

<p>
Sometimes, one needs to do an upgrade of a machine when one can't easily
use the normal upgrade process.
One can usually do this by carefully following a process similar to a
source-based upgrade:

<ul>
<li><b>Place install files in a "good" location</b>.
Make sure you have sufficient room!

<li><b>Stop any "insecure" applications from starting at boot:</b>
There will be a time when PF will be unlikely to be running during this
upgrade process, but your applications may still start and run properly.
Any application dependant upon PF for security should be disabled
before this happens, and should not be re-enabled until proper PF
operation is verified after upgrade.
There may be other applications which you wish to keep from running
during the upgrade, stop and disable them as well.

<li><b>Install new kernel(s)</b>
<blockquote><pre>
cd /<i>path</i>
rm /obsd ; ln /bsd /obsd && cp bsd /nbsd && mv /nbsd /bsd
cp bsd.rd bsd.mp /
</pre></blockquote>

Note the extra steps for copying over the primary kernel: those are done
to ensure that there is always a valid copy of the kernel on the disk
that the system can boot from should there be a really badly timed power
outage or system crash.

<li><b>Install new <tt>/etc/firmware</tt> files:</b>
Due to the fact that some uploaded "firmware" blobs were relocated from
the kernel to files in the <tt>/etc/firmware</tt> directory, there are
a few drivers which will break if there is no uploadable firmware file
available when the new kernel boots.
This will impact users of only a few devices, though all
users can use this step without harm.
To extract the firmware files from <tt>base38.tgz</tt>, use the
following as root:

<blockquote><pre>
cd /
tar xzpf /<i>path</i>/base38.tgz "*etc/firmware/*"
</pre></blockquote>

before the next step.

<li><b>Reboot on the new kernel:</b>
This might be a tempting step to skip, but it should be done now, as
usually, the new kernel will run old userland apps (such as the soon to
be important <tt>reboot</tt>!), but often a new userland will NOT
work on the old kernel.

<li><b>Install new userland applications.</b>
<i>Do NOT install <tt>etc38.tgz</tt> and <tt>xetc38.tgz</tt> now!</i>

<blockquote><pre>
cd /
tar xzpf /<i>path</i>/base38.tgz
tar xzpf /<i>path</i>/comp38.tgz
tar xzpf /<i>path</i>/game38.tgz
tar xzpf /<i>path</i>/man38.tgz
tar xzpf /<i>path</i>/misc38.tgz
tar xzpf /<i>path</i>/xbase38.tgz
tar xzpf /<i>path</i>/xfont38.tgz
tar xzpf /<i>path</i>/xserv38.tgz
tar xzpf /<i>path</i>/xshare38.tgz
</pre></blockquote>
Note: not all file sets will need to be installed for all applications,
however if you installed a file set originally, you should certainly
upgrade it with the new file set now.

<p>
Note: the files in <tt>/etc</tt> are handled separately below, so
<tt>etc38.tgz</tt> and <tt>xetc38.tgz</tt> are NOT unpacked here.

<li><b>Update <tt>/dev</tt>.</b>
The new
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-3.9/i386/MAKEDEV">MAKEDEV</a>
file will be copied to /dev by the installation of
<tt>base38.tgz</tt>, so you simply need to do the following:
<blockquote><pre>
cd /dev
./MAKEDEV all
</pre></blockquote>

<li><b>Upgrade <tt>/etc</tt> as below</b>.

<li><b>Reboot</b>
</ul>

During this process,
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sendmail.8">sendmail(8)</a>
may produce some error messages like the following:
<pre>
    Nov 1 12:47:05 puffy sm-mta[16733]: filesys_update failed: No such file or directory, fs=., avail=-1, blocksize=380204
</pre>
These messages can be safely ignored, or you may wish to halt
sendmail(8) during the upgrade process.

<hr>
<p>
<h2 id="etcUpdates">Updates to <tt>/etc</tt></h2>

Whether you upgrade by using an install media and doing a formal
"upgrade" process, or do a "in-place" binary upgrade, there are certain
manual steps that have to be performed.

<h4 id="users">New users and groups</h4>
An HostAP daemon has been added, so new users and groups are required.

As <i>root</i>, add the following users and groups, using
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/useradd.8">useradd(8)</a>:

<blockquote><pre>
useradd -u86 -g=uid -c"HostAP Daemon" -d/var/empty -s/sbin/nologin _hostapd
</pre></blockquote>

This step will add both the new user and its corresponding group.
Your environment may allow you to copy/paste those commands.


<h4 id="apps">Userland Applications</h4>

<h4 id="etcfiles"><tt>/etc</tt> file changes</h4>
You will want to extract the <tt>etc38.tgz</tt> files to a temporary
location:
<blockquote><pre>
cd /tmp
tar xzpf /<i>path</i>/etc38.tgz
</pre></blockquote>


Files that can probably be copied from <tt>etc38.tgz</tt> "as is":

<blockquote><pre>
hostapd.conf
netstart
pf.os
rc
services
mtree/*
</pre></blockquote>

Note that it IS possible to locally modify these files, if this has been
done, manual merging will be needed.
Here are copy/paste lines for copying these files, assuming you unpacked
<tt>etc38.tgz</tt> in the above recommended place:

<blockquote><pre>
cd /tmp/etc
cp hostapd.conf netstart pf.os rc services /etc
cp mtree/* /etc/mtree/
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Files that must be manually merged, respecting any local
changes made to them, if they were modified from the default,
otherwise, just copy them over, too:

<blockquote><pre>
ftpusers
inetd.conf
login.conf
rc.conf
sysctl.conf
syslog.conf
mail/aliases
</pre></blockquote>

The changes to these files are in <a href="upgrade38.patch">this
patch file</a>.
You can attempt to use this by executing the following as root:
<blockquote><pre>
cd /
patch -C -p0 &lt;upgrade38.patch
</pre></blockquote>

This will test the patch to see how well it will apply to YOUR system,
to actually apply it, leave off the "<tt>-C</tt>" option.
Note that it is likely that if you have customized files or not kept
them closely updated, or are upgrading from an snapshot of 3.7, they may
not accept the patch cleanly.
In those cases, you will need to manually apply the changes.
Please test this process before relying on it for a machine you can not
easily get to.

<p>
Note that since the <tt>/etc/mail/aliases</tt> file has been changed,
you need to run
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/newaliases.8">newaliases(8)</a>
to have them take effect.

<p>
The following files have had changes which should be looked at, but it
is unlikely they should be directly copied or merged (i.e., if you are
using pf.conf, look at the suggested change of strategy, and decide if
it is appropriate for your use).

<blockquote><pre>
pf.conf
spamd.conf
/root/.profile
</pre></blockquote>


Finally, use
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/mtree.8">mtree(8)</a>
to create any new directories:
<blockquote><pre>
mtree -qdef /etc/mtree/4.4BSD.dist -p / -u
</pre></blockquote>

The following files have had changes which should be inspected, but
are unlikely to be directly copied or merged (i.e., if you are using
pf.conf, look at the suggested change of strategy, and decide if it

Add more warnings about not unpacking etc38.tgz, xetc38.tgz in along
with other *.tgz files, Chris Linn was VERY insistent upon that, though
I rejected his suggestion of making it blood-red and using <blink>. ;)

running one <code>pkg_add -r -q list_of_new_pkgs</code> should work in

<li>Every instance of mozilla is an exception.  All mozilla, bloatzilla,

first, then run pkg_add with the new package.
