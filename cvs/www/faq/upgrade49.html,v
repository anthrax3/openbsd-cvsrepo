<i>Note: Upgrades are only supported from one release to the release
immediately following it.
Do not skip releases.</i>

<p><i>
It is highly recommended that you read through and fully understand
this process before attempting it.
If you are doing it on a critical or physically remote machine, it is
recommended that you test this process on an identical, local system to
verify its success before attempting on a critical or remote computer.
</i>

<p>
Upgrading is a convenient way to bring your OpenBSD system up to the most
recent version.
However, the results are not intended to precisely match the results of
a wipe-and-reload installation.
Old library files in particular are not removed in the upgrade process,
as they may be required by older applications that may or may not be
upgraded at this time.
If you REALLY wish to get rid of all these old files, you are probably
better off reinstalling from scratch.

<p>
<h2 id="before">Before upgrading: things to think about and be aware of</h2>
This is <i>not</i> a complete list of the changes that took place
between 4.8 and 4.9, but rather some of the important things that will
impact a large number of users in the upgrade process.
For a more complete list of changes, see
<a href="../plus49.html">plus49.html</a> and the CVS change logs.

<ul>
<li id="wpa"><b>WPA configuration changes:</b><br>
wpa-psk(8) is no longer used because wpakey support is now built
directly into ifconfig(8).
Inspect your /etc/hostname.* files for wireless
devices using WPA and replace:
<blockquote><pre>
<b>nwid myssid wpapsk `wpa-psk myssid wpapassword`</b>
</pre></blockquote>
with the simpler form:
<blockquote><pre>
<b>nwid myssid wpakey wpapassword</b>
</pre></blockquote>

<li id="misc"><b>No more miscXX.tgz file:</b><br>
The files of the miscXX.tgz file set are now rolled into other file
sets (mostly manXX.tgz).

<p>
<li id="kern"><b>Modified kernel:</b><br>
Check whether you have made any modifications to your kernel.
For example, you might have modified your network device to use a
non-default setting using config(8).
Note your changes, so you can repeat them for the new 4.9 kernel.

</ul>

<p>
<hr>
<h2 id="upgrade">The upgrade process</h2>

<h3>Upgrading by install kernel</h3>
If you have access to the system's console, the easiest and safest way
to upgrade is to boot from the install kernel by boot media or
<a href="faq4.html#bsd.rd">bsd.rd</a> and follow the upgrade steps,
which are very similar to the <a href="faq4.html">install process</a>.

<p>
Afterwards, complete the upgrade by following the <a href="#final">final
steps</a> as detailed below.

<p>
One easy way to boot from the install kernel is to place the 4.9 version
of <i>bsd.rd</i> in the root of your boot drive, then instruct the boot loader
to boot using this new <i>bsd.rd</i> file.
On amd64 and i386, you do this by entering "<tt>boot bsd.rd</tt>" at the
initial <tt>boot&gt;</tt> prompt.

<h3>Upgrading without install kernel</h3>
<i>This is NOT the recommended process.  Use the install kernel method
if at all possible!</i>

<p>
Sometimes, one needs to do an upgrade of a machine when one can't easily
use the normal upgrade process.
The most common case is when the machine is in a remote location and you
don't have easy access to the system console.
One can usually do this by carefully following this process:

<ul>
<li><b>Place install files in a "good" location</b>.
Make sure you have sufficient space!

<p>
<li><b>Become root with ksh(1):</b>
While using
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/sudo.8">sudo(8)</a>
before each command is generally a good practice, the sudo(8) command
will be broken by the last steps, so you should be root before starting
this process.
Also, the use of the OpenBSD
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/ksh.1">ksh(1)</a>
shell is assumed.

<p>
<li><b>Stop any appropriate applications:</b>
During this process, all the userland applications will be replaced but
may not be runnable, and strange things may happen as a result.
If this is a concern to you, shut down any applications that may
be impacted.
There may be other applications which you wish to keep from running
immediately after the upgrade, stop and disable them as well.

<p>
<li><b>Check the kernel:</b>
Although <b>most people can skip this step</b>, if you had a modified kernel
in 4.8, it is likely you will need to modify the stock kernel of 4.9.
Especially when you are performing the upgrade process remotely, now is
the time to make sure the new kernel will work upon rebooting the machine.
If any changes must be made to the kernel, the safest thing to do is to
make those changes on a local 4.9 system.
This can be as simple as modifying a specific device using config(8),
or it can involve a recompilation if the option you need is not included
in the GENERIC kernel.
Please consult <a href="faq5.html">FAQ 5 - Building the system from source</a>
before deciding to recompile your kernel.

<p>
<li><b>Install new kernel(s):</b>

<ul>
<li>If using a single processor kernel:
<blockquote><pre>
<b>export RELEASEPATH=</b><i>/usr/rel</i>   <i># where you put the files</i>
<b>cd ${RELEASEPATH}</b>
<b>rm /obsd ; ln /bsd /obsd && cp bsd /nbsd && mv /nbsd /bsd</b>
<b>cp bsd.rd bsd.mp /</b>
</pre></blockquote>
(note: you will get a harmless error message if your platform doesn't
have a bsd.mp):
<p>

<li>If you are using the multiprocessor kernel:
<blockquote><pre>
<b>export RELEASEPATH=</b><i>/usr/rel</i>   <i># where you put the files</i>
<b>cd ${RELEASEPATH}</b>
<b>rm /obsd ; ln /bsd /obsd && cp bsd.mp /nbsd && mv /nbsd /bsd</b>
<b>cp bsd.rd /</b>
<b>cp bsd /bsd.sp</b>
</pre></blockquote>
</ul>

<p>
Note the extra steps for copying over the primary kernel: those are done
to ensure that there is always a valid copy of the kernel on the disk
that the system can boot from should there be a really badly timed power
outage or system crash.

<p>
<li><b>Save yourself a copy of the old reboot(1) command:</b>
You are still running the old kernel, it is possible the new reboot
command will not run on the old kernel.

<blockquote><pre>
<b>cp /sbin/reboot /sbin/oreboot</b>
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
<li><b>Install new userland applications.</b>
<i>Do NOT install <tt>etc49.tgz</tt> and <tt>xetc49.tgz</tt> now, because
that will overwrite your current configuration files!</i>
Note that we are installing base49.tgz LAST, because it will include a new
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/tar.1">tar(1)</a>
utility, which may or may not run on the old kernel.
We reboot immediately, as the system is probably barely runnable now.

<blockquote><pre>
<b>tar -C / -xzphf xserv49.tgz</b>
<b>tar -C / -xzphf xfont49.tgz</b>
<b>tar -C / -xzphf xshare49.tgz</b>
<b>tar -C / -xzphf xbase49.tgz</b>
<b>tar -C / -xzphf game49.tgz</b>
<b>tar -C / -xzphf comp49.tgz</b>
<b>tar -C / -xzphf man49.tgz</b>
<b>tar -C / -xzphf base49.tgz</b> # Install last!
<b>/sbin/oreboot</b>
</pre></blockquote>

Not all file sets will need to be installed for all applications,
however if you installed a file set originally, you should certainly
upgrade it with the new file set now.

<p>
Again, the files in <tt>/etc</tt> are handled separately below, so
<tt>etc49.tgz</tt> and <tt>xetc49.tgz</tt> are NOT unpacked here.

<p>
<li><b>After reboot completes, upgrade <tt>/dev</tt>.</b>
The new
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-4.9/i386/MAKEDEV">MAKEDEV</a>
file was copied to /dev by the installation of
<tt>base49.tgz</tt>, so you simply need to do the following:
<blockquote><pre>
<b>cd /dev</b>
<b>./MAKEDEV all</b>
</pre></blockquote>

</ul>

<hr>
<h2 id="final">Final steps</h2>

Whether you upgrade by using an install kernel and doing a formal
"upgrade" process, or do a "in-place" binary upgrade, you need to update
the system configuration files which are included in the <tt>etc49.tgz</tt>
which have not been dealt with so far.
There are two processes we provide for you -- manually copying over some
files and patching others, or using the
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/sysmerge.8">sysmerge(8)</a>
process.

<p>
<h3 id="sysmerge">1a. Merging locally changed files via sysmerge(8)</h3>

<b>Who should use sysmerge(8):</b><br>
People running highly modified systems or systems that didn't start out
at the previous release (for example, a snapshot part way between
releases), who are upgrading to a snapshot or who have not carefully
upgraded their system in the past will find sysmerge vastly superior to
using the patches, as it works with what is actually on your system,
instead of what we expected was on your system.
It will also give you much greater control over your upgrade process,
and will involve you in it more closely.

<p>
<b>Who may wish to NOT use sysmerge(8):</b><br>
With recent improvements in sysmerge, we hope that relatively few
people have reason not to use sysmerge(8)!
However, people with a large quantity of similar machines to upgrade
may find the "patchfile" process faster, and perhaps the basis of
a customized upgrade script.

<p>
<b>Using sysmerge(8) for the first time:</b><br>
If you have a system that's been upgraded in the past via the patchfile
process you will probably find the FIRST time you upgrade by sysmerge,
you have a LOT of manual file changes to make.
This is because the patch file process only attempted to achieve
functional compatibility on the upgraded system, and did not respect
the version control information sysmerge(8) uses to identify "unchanged"
files.
Rest assured, later runs of sysmerge will be far less painful, and often
completely effortless.

<p>
The
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/sysmerge.8">sysmerge(8)</a>
utility will compare the files that are actually on your system with
those that would be installed in a fresh install, and assist you in
merging the changes into your system.
Note that unlike the patch file, there are no assumptions made about
what is actually on your system, so you can use sysmerge(8) to move
between more arbitrary <a href="faq5.html#Flavors">points in the
development process</a>, such as from an earlier <i>4.8-current</i> to
<i>4.9-release</i> or from one <i>-current</i> to a later one.
Sysmerge(8) compares the current files on your system with the files
that would have been installed with a new install, and what would have
been there from the last run of sysmerge.
Usually, it can figure out what to do to update your files, but if it
has difficulty, it will give you the option of keeping the old file,
installing the new file, or assisting you in the manual merging of the
old and new files, using
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/sdiff.1">sdiff</a>.

<p>
Please read the
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/sysmerge.8">sysmerge(8)</a>
manual page before using it on your system.
You are also advised to read the
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/diff.1">diff(1)</a>,
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/sdiff.1">sdiff(1)</a>
and even review
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/more.1">more(1)</a>
manual pages before continuing.

<p>
Assuming the <tt>etc49.tgz</tt> and <tt>xetc49.tgz</tt> files exists in
your $RELEASEPATH, run it with:

<blockquote><pre>
<b>sysmerge -s $RELEASEPATH/etc49.tgz -x $RELEASEPATH/xetc49.tgz</b>
</pre></blockquote>

For the files sysmerge(8) can't resolve on its own, it will show you a
unified
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/diff.1">diff(1)</a>,
run through your favorite $PAGER (i.e.,
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/more.1">more(1)</a>)
and ask you if you wish to:
<blockquote><pre>
  Use 'd' to delete the temporary ./var/www/htdocs/index.html
  Use 'i' to install the temporary ./var/www/htdocs/index.html
  Use 'm' to merge the temporary and installed versions
  Use 'v' to view the diff results again

  Default is to leave the temporary file to deal with by hand
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
If you wish to retain your existing file, delete the temporary file, if
you wish to replace your existing file with the new version, install the
temporary file.
If you wish to merge the two together, choosing 'm' will put you into
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/sdiff.1">sdiff(1)</a>,
where you can manually merge the file.
The default is to come back and deal with the file later, manually.

<p>
Sysmerge(8) saves all your replaced files into a temporary directory,
similar to <tt>/var/tmp/sysmerge.24959/backups</tt>, so if you accidentally
clobber something that was probably not such a good idea, you have a chance
to recover it. Note that
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/daily.8">daily(8)</a>
cleans old files from this directory.


<p>
<h3 id="patchfile">1b. Merging locally changed files via a patch file</h3>
This process makes a lot of assumptions about what files you have and
have not modified, and that you are upgrading from <i>4.8-relase</i> to
<i>4.9-release</i>.
Before following this, make sure your system matches the assumptions,
and alter the process accordingly if needed -- or use the above
sysmerge process.

<p id="UsersGroups">
No new users and groups need to be created for 4.9.
<!--
The following users need to be created for 4.8:

<blockquote><pre>
<b>useradd -u 99 -g =uid -c "sndio privsep" -d /var/empty -s /sbin/nologin _sndio
useradd -u 100 -g =uid -c "LDAP Daemon" -d /var/empty -s /sbin/nologin _ldapd
useradd -u 101 -g =uid -c "IKEv2 Daemon" -d /var/empty -s /sbin/nologin _iked</b>
</pre></blockquote>
-->

<p>
You will want to extract the <tt>etc49.tgz</tt> files to a temporary
location:
<blockquote><pre>
<b>export RELEASEPATH=/usr/rel</b>
<b>tar -C /tmp -xzphf ${RELEASEPATH}/etc49.tgz</b>
</pre></blockquote>


Files that can probably be copied from <tt>etc49.tgz</tt> "as is":

<blockquote><pre>
etc/daily
etc/disktab
etc/man.conf
etc/monthly
etc/netstart
etc/nsd.conf
etc/pf.os
etc/rc
etc/rc.conf
etc/weekly
</pre></blockquote>

Note that it IS possible to locally modify these files; if this has been
done, do NOT simply copy over those files, and consider using the
<a href="#sysmerge">sysmerge(8) process</a> instead.
<!-- Pay special attention to <tt>mail/*</tt> if you are using something
other than the default Sendmail(8) configuration. -->
Here are copy/paste lines for copying these files, assuming you unpacked
<tt>etc49.tgz</tt> in the above recommended place:

<blockquote><pre>
<b>cd /tmp/etc </b>
<b>cp daily disktab man.conf monthly netstart nsd.conf pf.os rc rc.conf weekly /etc</b>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>


<p>
These files likely have local changes, but should be updated for
4.9.  IF you have not altered these files, you can copy over the
new version, otherwise the changes should be merged with your files:

<blockquote><pre>
etc/changelist
etc/rc.local
etc/rc.shutdown
etc/services
etc/ssh/sshd_config
etc/sysctl.conf
var/www/conf/mime.types
</pre></blockquote>

The changes to these files are in <a href="upgrade49.patch">this
patch file</a>.
Please test this process before relying on it for a machine you can not
easily get to.
You can attempt to use this by executing the following as root:
<blockquote><pre>
<b>cd /</b>
<b>patch -C -p0 &lt; upgrade49.patch</b>
</pre></blockquote>

This will test the patch to see how well it will apply to YOUR system;
to actually apply it, leave off the "<tt>-C</tt>" option.
Note that it is likely that if you have customized files or not kept
them closely updated, or are upgrading from a snapshot of 4.8, they may
not accept the patch cleanly.
Make sure all file changes are attempted; patch(1) may quit prematurely
if it gets too confused in one file, which may happen if your machine
was originally installed from a snapshot or otherwise has some interim
changes.
The last file to be changed here should be <tt>var/www/conf/mime.types</tt>.
Deleting the file sections that fail from the patch file may permit the
rest to be applied.
You will need to manually apply the changes that are skipped.

<p>
The following files have had changes which should be looked at, but it
is unlikely they should be directly copied or merged (i.e., if you are
using pf.conf, look at the suggested change of strategy, and decide if
it is appropriate for your use).

<blockquote><pre>
etc/bgpd.conf
etc/ldap/core.schema
</pre></blockquote>

<p>

Finally, use
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/newaliases.8">newaliases(8)</a>
to update the aliases database,
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/mtree.8">mtree(8)</a>
create any new directories:

<blockquote><pre>
<b>newaliases</b>
<b>mtree -qdef /etc/mtree/4.4BSD.dist -p / -u</b>
</pre></blockquote>


<h3 id="RmFiles">2. Files to delete</h3>
A number of files should be deleted from your system.
Note that some of these may not exist on all systems; that's ok.
Copy and paste the following lines:

<h3 id="Kernchk">3. Checking the kernel</h3>
Note: <b>most people can skip this step!</b>
<p>
If you followed the instructions for the upgrade process without install
kernel, you have already completed this step.
However, if you used the install kernel, and if you had a modified kernel
in 4.8, it is likely you will need to modify the stock kernel of 4.9.
This can be as simple as modifying a specific device using config(8),
or it can involve a recompilation if the option you need is not included
in the GENERIC kernel.
Please consult <a href="faq5.html">FAQ 5 - Building the system from source</a>
before considering to recompile your kernel.

<p>
<h3 id="Pkgup">4. Upgrading packages</h3>
If you installed any packages on your system, you should upgrade them
after completing the upgrade of the base system.
Be aware, however, many packages will require further setup before
and/or after upgrading the package.
Check with the application's upgrade guide for details.

<p>
The following packages are known to have significant upgrade issues that
will impact a large number of users.
The fact that a package is not on this list doesn't mean it will have a
trivial upgrade.
You must do some homework on the applications YOU use.

<ul>
<li><b>kqemu:</b> Must be kept in sync with the kernel. pkg_delete prior
to the upgrade, then pkg_add the new package once the upgrade has been
completed.

<li><b>ruby:</b>
The ruby port was split into two separate ports for ruby 1.8 and
ruby 1.9, similar to how the python port is handled.
The ruby 1.8 binaries are now installed with a 18 suffix, and
the ruby 1.9 binaries are installed with a 19 suffix.
The ruby-gems and ruby-rake packages also install the binaries with
a 18 suffix, as those packages are included in ruby 1.9.
If you want to make ruby 1.8 (or 1.9) the default system ruby, you
need to follow the instructions that are displayed after
installing/updating the package.

<li><b>PostgreSQL:</b>
Has been updated to 9.0.3. It's a major upgrade and you need
to dump/restore your databases.
You can look at this small
<a href="http://openbsd.raveland.org/ports/postgresql/UPGRADE_HOWTO.txt">howto</a>
if you want more details about this.
Note that pkg_add will warn you about this upgrade.

<li><b>Ruby on Rails:</b>
Ruby on Rails has been updated to 3.0.3. It's a major upgrade and you need
to make significant changes to your Rails app to update it from the previous
version (2.3.4). The
<a href="http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/3_0_release_notes.html">
Rails 3 Release Notes</a> have a lot of helpful information
about the upgrade process.

<li><b>OpenLDAP:</b>
Has been updated to 2.4.23. It's a major upgrade and you need
to backup all your data before this upgrade. Please read this
<a href="http://marc.info/?l=openbsd-ports&amp;m=129440451210138&amp;w=2">message</a>
for more details.

<li><b>Asterisk:</b>
has had a major update to the 1.8 branch.
Although many configurations will not require changes,
users should review the <a
href="http://svn.asterisk.org/svn/asterisk/tags/1.8.2.2/UPGRADE.txt">upgrade
notes</a>.
Memory use has increased; if this causes a problem and you
do not require IAX2, adding 'noload=chan_iax2.so' to
/etc/asterisk/modules.conf will significantly reduce memory use.

</ul>

<p>
The package tools support in-place updating using <tt>pkg_add -u</tt>.
For instance, to update all your packages, make sure <tt>PKG_PATH</tt> is
pointing to the 4.9 packages directory on your CD or nearest FTP mirror,
and use something like

<blockquote><pre>
<b>pkg_add -ui</b>
</pre></blockquote>

where the <tt>-u</tt> indicates update mode, and <tt>-i</tt> specifies
interactive mode, so pkg_add will prompt you for input when it encounters
some ambiguity. Read the
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-4.9/pkg_add">pkg_add(1)</a>
manual page and the <a href="faq15.html#PkgMgmt">package management</a>
chapter of the FAQ for more information.

<h3>3b. Merging locally changed files via sysmerge(8)</h3>

<p>
The
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sysmerge&amp;sektion=8">sysmerge(8)</a>
utility will compare the files that are actually on your system with
those that would be installed to a fresh install, and assist you in
merging the changes into your system.
Note that unlike the patch file, there are no assumptions made about
what is actually on your system, so you can use sysmerge(8) to move
between more arbitrary <a href="faq5.html#Flavors">points in the
development process</a>, such as from an earlier <i>-current</i> to
<i>4.8-release</i> or from one <i>-current</i> to a later one.
Sysmerge(8) compares the current files on your system with the files
that would have been installed with a new install, and gives you the
option of keeping the old file, installing the new file, or assisting
you in the manual merging of the old and new files, using
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sdiff&amp;sektion=1">sdiff</a>.
You may opt to use sysmerge to make the changes, or you may wish to use
the patch file first, and then follow up with a sysmerge session to
clean up any loose ends.

<p>
<b>Who should use sysmerge(8):</b><br>
People running highly modified systems or systems that didn't start out
at the previous release (for example, a snapshot partway between
releases), who are upgrading to a snapshot or who have not carefully
upgraded their system in the past will find sysmerge vastly superior to
using the patches, as it works with what is actually on your system,
instead of what we expected was on your system.
It will also give you much greater control over your upgrade process,
and will involve you in it more closely.

<p>
<b>Who may wish to NOT use sysmerge(8):</b><br>
With recent improvements in sysmerge, we hope that relatively few
people have reason not to use sysmerge(8)!

<p>
Please read the 
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sysmerge&amp;sektion=8">sysmerge(8)</a>
manual page before using it on your system.
You are also advised to read the
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=diff&amp;sektion=1">diff(1)</a>,
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sdiff&amp;sektion=1">sdiff(1)</a>
and even review
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=more&amp;sektion=1">more(1)</a>
manual pages before continuing.

<p>
Assuming the <tt>etc49.tgz</tt> and <tt>xetc49.tgz</tt> files exists in
your $RELEASEPATH, run it with:

<blockquote><pre>
<b>sysmerge -s $RELEASEPATH/etc49.tgz -x $RELEASEPATH/xetc49.tgz</b>
</pre></blockquote>

Sysmerge(8) will show you a unified
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=diff&amp;sektion=1">diff(1)</a>,
run through your favorite $PAGER (i.e.,
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=more&amp;sektion=1">more(1)</a>)
and ask you, for most changed files, if you wish to:
<blockquote><pre>
  Use 'd' to delete the temporary ./var/www/htdocs/index.html
  Use 'i' to install the temporary ./var/www/htdocs/index.html
  Use 'm' to merge the temporary and installed versions
  Use 'v' to view the diff results again

  Default is to leave the temporary file to deal with by hand
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
If you wish to retain your existing file, delete the temporary file, if
you wish to replace your existing file with the new version, install the
temporary file.
If you wish to merge the two together, chosing 'm' will put you into
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sdiff&amp;sektion=1">sdiff(1)</a>,
where you can manually merge the file.
The default is to come back and deal with the file later, manually.

<p>
Sysmerge(8) saves all your replaced files into a temporary directory,
similar to <tt>/var/tmp/sysmerge.24959/backups</tt>, so if you accidentally
clobber something that was probably not such a good idea, you have a chance
to recover it. Note that 
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=daily&amp;sektion=8">daily(8)</a>
cleans old files from this directory.
