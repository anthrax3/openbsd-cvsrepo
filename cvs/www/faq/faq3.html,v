@merge faq2 and faq3 (getting to know openbsd and getting started with openbsd)
into faq1 (introduction to openbsd)

put a redirect to the faq index in place of the old files, and do the same
for faq12 (which was removed a while ago)

<h2 id="BuyCD">Buying an OpenBSD CD set</h2>

Purchasing an OpenBSD CD set is generally the best way to get started.
Visit the <a href= "../orders.html">ordering page</a> to purchase your copy.

<p>
There are many good reasons to own an OpenBSD CD set:

<ul>
  <li>CD sales support ongoing development of OpenBSD.
  <li>Development of a multi-platform operating system requires constant
      investment in equipment.
  <li>Your support in the form of a CD set purchase has a real impact on
      future development.
  <li>The CDs contains binaries (and source) for the most popular supported
      platforms.
  <li>The CDs are bootable on several platforms, and can be used to bootstrap
      a machine without a pre-existing installed operating system.
  <li>The CDs are useful for bootstrapping even if you choose to install a
      snapshot.
  <li>Installing from CD is faster and preserves bandwidth.
  <li>OpenBSD CDs always come with very nice artwork and stickers.
      Your system isn't fully complete without these.
      You can only get these stickers by buying a CD set.
  <li>The CD set is complete enough to bring up a full development environment
      without any network connection at all.
</ul>

<p>
If you're installing a release version of OpenBSD, you should use an official
CD set.

<h2 id="BuyTShirts">Buying OpenBSD shirts</h2>

Yes, OpenBSD has T-shirts for your wearing enjoyment!
You can view them <a href="../tshirts.html">here</a>.

<h2 id="Download">Downloading OpenBSD</h2>

There are numerous international mirror sites offering access to
OpenBSD releases and snapshots.
You should always use the site nearest to you.
Before you begin fetching a release or snapshot, you may wish to use
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/ping">ping(8)</a>
and
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/traceroute">traceroute(8)</a>
to determine which mirror site is nearest to you and whether that mirror is
performing adequately.
Access information is <a href= "../ftp.html">here</a>.
Of course, your OpenBSD release CD is always closer than any mirror.

<p>
In the same directory as the installation sets, each mirror includes a file
named <tt>SHA256</tt> that contains checksums of the various installation
files.
You can confirm that none of the downloaded files were mangled in transit
using the <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/sha256">sha256(1)</a> command.

<blockquote><pre>
$ <b>sha256 -c SHA256</b>
</pre></blockquote>

Note that this only checks for <i>accidental</i> corruption.
You can use <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/signify">signify(1)</a>
to cryptographically verify the downloaded files.

<blockquote><pre>
$ <b>signify -Cp /etc/signify/openbsd-XX-base.pub -x SHA256.sig install*.iso</b>
Signature Verified
installXX.iso: OK
</pre></blockquote>

This will verify the <tt>installXX.iso</tt> file, for example.
Replace "XX" with the version of OpenBSD that you're verifying.
Note that you will need the public key files for OpenBSD's base system
(and the signify program!) in order to do this.

<h2 id="SelectHW">Selecting hardware</h2>

Selecting appropriate hardware to run your OpenBSD system on is important,
as it can mean the difference between success and failure of a project.

<p>
If you are shopping for a new PC, whether you are buying it piece by piece
or completely pre-built, you want to make sure first that you are buying
reliable parts.
In the PC world, this is not easy.
<b>Bad or otherwise unreliable or mismatched parts can make OpenBSD run
poorly and crash often</b>.
The best advice we can give is to be careful, and buy brands and parts that
have been reviewed by an authority you trust.
Sometimes a more expensive machine is a better quality machine.
Other times it is not.

<p>
There are certain things that will help bring out the maximum performance
of your system:

<ul>
<li><b>Let the application choose the hardware:</b>
It is usually better to make an adjustment to the hardware you were
planning on using rather than compromising on your application design
because you have something you "really wanted to use."

<li><b>Identify your bottlenecks:</b>
Don't pay extra for the cutting-edge processor if your application is
restricted by disk I/O.
Don't pay for fast disks if your system is restricted by network speed.
Don't pay for much of anything if your bottleneck is a 128kbps DSL line.

<li><b>Keep it simple:</b>
Simple hardware usually has simple problems.
Complex hardware that isn't supposed to ever break may take you a long
time to repair when it breaks anyway.

<li><b>Use hardware you understand, or learn the new hardware before you
implement a production system:</b>
Regardless of the technical merits of the hardware, committing to use a
particular type of hardware before you have become familiar with it,
both how it works <i>and how it fails</i>, is foolish.

<li><b>Use multiple disks:</b>
Instead of buying one large disk, buy multiple smaller disks.
While this may cost more, distributing the load over multiple spindles will
decrease the amount of time necessary to access data on the disks.
And, with more spindles, you can get more reliability and faster data access
with RAID.

<li><b>Break up large blocks of storage:</b>
Many people make the mistake of designing a system that stores large amounts
of data to have one "big block" of storage.
This is usually a bad design.
You will usually find it much better to break up your storage into
manageable blocks.
This has many advantages, two of the biggest being that you can add more
storage later when you need it easily (you weren't going to get the
requirements estimate right, no one ever does), and you can buy a small
amount of storage now, then add much more later when the price will have
most likely dropped and the capacity will have increased.

<li><b>Avoid cheap network adapters:</b>
OpenBSD supports a plethora of cheap network adapters.
These adapters work great in home systems and low or moderate throughput
business and research environments.
If you need high throughput and low impact on your server, you are better
off buying a quality network adapter.
Unfortunately, some name-brand adapters are not much better than the
cheap adapters, and some potentially good adapters do not have accurate
documentation available to write good drivers.
Gigabit adapters often perform better than 10Mbps/100Mbps adapters, even
when used on slower speed networks, due to superior buffering.

</ul>

@each faq page has header and footer links that look like this:

[faq index] [to section x - some topic] [to section y - another topic]

that can be very useful if the faq you're reading only covers one topic,
or if the pages are meant to be read in order. it makes sense to have
them on the pf and smtpd faq pages, but the main faq contains a variety
of unrelated topics, so they're not actually very useful there. remove.

while here, make a few subject titles more concise.

                           to learn OpenBSD on?</a>
a193 73

<h2 id="FirstSys">3.5 - What is an appropriate "first system" to learn
OpenBSD on?</h2>

While OpenBSD will run on a smaller, older and less powerful computer than
just about any other modern OS, if you are just getting started with OpenBSD,
using such a machine can be frustrating.
The following guidelines are ONLY guidelines; OpenBSD will run very well
on much more modest equipment than is listed here, but it may be more
frustrating than needed for a first-time user.

<ul>
<li><b>Platform:</b>
Use a platform you are familiar with already.
When you are learning a new operating system, it is a very bad time to
also be learning a new platform.
We'll assume you are going to be using the <a href="../i386.html">i386</a>
or <a href="../amd64.html">amd64</a> platforms here, as they are probably
the ones most people are familiar with.
Once you are familiar with OpenBSD, though, it makes a good introduction
to other platforms.

<li><b>Processor:</b>
You would be hard-pressed to find a new CPU that isn't adequate.
Yes, OpenBSD will run on a 25MHz 80486, but you won't want to do the
experimenting and messing up and reloading you need to do to really get
to know the system on a slow machine.
The primary irritation you will first encounter with a processor slower
than this is the time it takes to SSH into the box.

<li><b>128MB RAM or better:</b>
If you wish to run X, 256MB would be a better starting point.

<li><b>Hard disk:</b>
2GB of disk space will give you an easy install of a simple system, such as
a firewall, DNS server, or similar.
If you wish to rebuild the system from source, you will probably want at
least 8GB available.
If you have a very large hard drive, don't feel obligated to allocate all
of it initially -- there is nothing wrong with leaving part of your disk
unallocated if you only need a small amount.

<li><b>Network adapter:</b>
Use a PCI or PCIe adapter.
If you are planning on putting multiple network adapters in the machine,
write the MAC address on the spine of the card before putting the cover on.

<li><b>Multibooting:</b>
For your first OpenBSD installation, don't attempt to multiboot with
another OS.
<a href="faq4.html#Multibooting">Multibooting</a> is a difficult process
to get right, and you must understand all the OSs involved well before
attempting this, which is clearly not the case on your first installation.
It is very possible you could accidently delete all data on the system.
Rather, use a dedicated computer, or at least a dedicated disk on a machine.

<li><b>Laptops:</b>
While many laptops work very well with OpenBSD, they are sometimes not the
easiest systems to get running well, so a laptop might not be the best
choice for your first OpenBSD install.
However, once you are comfortable with OpenBSD, a laptop can be a very
useful tool.

<li><b>New hardware:</b>
Brand new, cutting-edge hardware is sometimes not yet supported by OpenBSD,
so for your first OpenBSD system, a slightly older machine is recommended.
Do your research beforehand.

</ul>

Obviously, "the more, the better" to a point.
While OpenBSD's requirements are very modest, some popular applications
seemingly use as much processor and memory as you can throw at the system.

<h2 id="ISO">3.3 - Does OpenBSD provide an ISO image for download?</h2>

For select platforms, yes!

<p>
Most platforms that are able to boot from CD-ROM have ISO images available
for download that can be used to create bootable OpenBSD install CD-ROMs.
Both "full install" (all files needed for a full OpenBSD install, named
<tt>installXX.iso</tt>) and "boot only" (for installing from a network file
source, named <tt>cdXX.iso</tt>) ISOs are provided for these platforms.

<p>
Note, these ISO files are <i>not</i> the same as the
<a href="../orders.html">official CD</a> set.
These images are for single platforms, and do not include any of the
pre-compiled <a href="faq15.html">packages</a>, stickers, or artwork
that the official CD set does.

<p>
The OpenBSD project does not make the ISO images used to master the official
CDs available for download.
The reason is simply that we would like you to buy the CD sets to help fund
ongoing OpenBSD development.
The official OpenBSD CD-ROM layout is copyright Theo de Raadt.
Theo does not permit people to redistribute images of the official OpenBSD
CDs.
As an incentive for people to buy the CD set, some extras are included in
the package as well (artwork, stickers etc).

<p>
Note that only the CD layout is copyrighted, OpenBSD itself is free.
Nothing precludes someone else from downloading OpenBSD and making their
own CD.

<p>
Those that need or want a bootable USB drive instead can use the
<tt>installXX.fs</tt> (bootable, plus install sets) or <tt>minirootXX.fs</tt>
(just bootable, file sets are pulled down via network) files, which can be
imaged onto a USB flash disk or other storage device with the
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=dd">dd(1)</a> command.

@Part of a big diff from TJ, much more to come later:
- mention that the usb images can be written with dd
- clarify that SHA256 only checks for accidental damage
- improve signify example (it stands to reason that brand new users might
  not have openbsd installed already.)
- i think we can stop talking about pentium two processors and one

It is still usually faster and simpler to download the boot media and
then install just the portions needed.

clean up a screwup from a couple days ago, caused by committing a simple
typo fix from the wrong tree, adding a couple articles I had forgot
about.  But, they are pretty good, so fix 'em up a bit and leave 'em.
So:
+3.5 - Selecting hardware (some old FAQ content, some new stuff from me)
+3.6 - "first system" recommendations (by me)
bump copyright date
normalize punctiation and line spacing (for a relative def. of "normalize")
Remove a couple sections that didn't work well
update in time (80386? 32M? yikes, been sitting there a while!).

<li><b>Use SCSI if you need very high disk performance.</b>
Using high end SCSI disks (higher cost 10k RPM to 15k RPM disks), you can
achieve better performance than high-end IDE disks, when matched
with a appropriate and supported SCSI adapter.
Conversely, if you are using medium or low end or older SCSI disks, this
is a waste of money, and IDE will serve you just as well, if not better.
Be realistic: a top-speed disk system on your simple firewall is likely
to cause you far more problems and the "performance" will never be seen.

<p>If you are building a server, and you need more than one drive,
you may want to consider SCSI.
IDE limits you to two disks per controller.
Concurrent access to these two disks may have a negative
impact on the I/O performance of these disks.
Wide SCSI limits you to 15 per channel, and has better support for
concurrent access than IDE.
While SCSI costs more, the flexibility and performance can justify these
costs in some environments.

<p>
<li><b>Use ECC or parity RAM.</b>
Parity adds some functionality to see if the data in RAM has been
corrupted.  ECC extends this functionality and attempts to correct
some bit corruption errors on the fly.
Obviously, the rest of your system must support parity or ECC before
you gain any benefit.

The source code for OpenBSD is freely redistributable and available at

Generally the best way to get started with a current source tree is to
install the source from the most recent CD and then configure AnonCVS to
update it regularly. Information about AnonCVS, including how to set it
up, is available here:
d165 9
a173 1
<a href= "../anoncvs.html">OpenBSD AnonCVS page</a>.

In a word, no. The OpenBSD project does not make the ISO images used to

that we would like you to buy the CD sets, helping fund the ongoing

There are numerous international mirror sites offering FTP access to OpenBSD 
releases and snapshots. AFS access is also available. You should always use
the site closest to you. Before you begin fetching a release or snapshot, you 
may wish to use <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ping&sektion=8">ping(8)</a> and <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=traceroute&sektion=8">traceroute(8)</a> to determine which mirror site is nearest
to you and whether that nearest mirror is performing adequately. Of course, 
your OpenBSD release CD is always closer than any mirror. Access information is

Generally the best way to get started with a current source tree is to install
the source from the most recent CD and then configure AnonCVS to update it
regularly. Information about AnonCVS, including how to set it up, is available
here:
</p>
a132 1
</p>
a135 1
</p>
d138 5
a142 6
If you don't have sufficient network bandwidth to support AnonCVS, or if your
Internet access is via UUCP, you can still keep your source current by using
CTM instead of AnonCVS. If that's your situation, then starting with a recent
release CD is even more important. Information about CTM, including how to set
it up, is available here:

re-target the faq.
Change internal links from #10.XX -> #somethingmeaningfull
This will probobly break some external links to us, but will allow
us greater mobility in moving internal things around without breaking

You can't. The official OpenBSD CD-ROM layout is copyright Theo de Raadt, as an

<li>Development of a multi-platform operating system requires constant investment in equipment. 
<li>Your support in the form of a CD purchase has a real impact on future development. 
<li>The CD contains binaries (and source) for all supported platforms. 
<li>The CD is bootable on several platforms, and can be used to bootstrap a machine without a pre-existing installed operating
system.
<li>The CD is useful for bootstrapping even if you choose to install a snapshot. 
<li>Installing from CD is faster! Installing from CD preserves network connectivity resources.
