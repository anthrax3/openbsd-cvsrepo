<h2 id="WhatIs">About OpenBSD</h2>

The <a href="../index.html">OpenBSD</a> project produces a freely available,
multi-platform 4.4BSD-based UNIX-like operating system.
Our <a href="../goals.html">goals</a> place emphasis on correctness, security,
standardization, and portability.

<h3>Why might I want to use it?</h3>

Some reasons why we think OpenBSD is a useful operating system:

<ul>
  <li>OpenBSD runs on many different hardware platforms.
  <li>OpenBSD is thought of as the most <a href="../security.html">secure</a>
      UNIX-like operating system by many security professionals, as a result
      of the never-ending comprehensive source code audit.
  <li>OpenBSD is a full-featured UNIX-like operating system available in source
      and binary form at no charge.
  <li>OpenBSD integrates cutting-edge security technology suitable for
      <a href="pf/example1.html">building firewalls</a> and private network
      services in a distributed environment.
  <li>OpenBSD benefits from strong ongoing development in many areas, offering
      opportunities to work with emerging technologies and an international
      community of developers and end users.
  <li>OpenBSD attempts to minimize the need for customization and tweaking.
      For the vast majority of users, OpenBSD <b>just works</b> on their
      hardware for their application.
</ul>

<h3 id="ReallyFree">Is OpenBSD really free?</h3>

OpenBSD is all free.
The binaries are free.
The source is free.
All parts of OpenBSD have reasonable copyright terms permitting free
redistribution.
More about OpenBSD's copyright policy can be found
<a href="../policy.html">here</a>.

<p>
The maintainers of OpenBSD support the project largely from their own pockets.
This includes the time spent programming for the project, equipment used to
support the many ports, network resources used to distribute OpenBSD to you,
and the time spent answering questions and investigating users' bug reports.
The OpenBSD developers are not independently wealthy, and even small
contributions of time, equipment and resources make a big difference.

<h3>What's included in the base system?</h3>

OpenBSD is distributed with a number of third-party software products,
including:

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.x.org/wiki">X.org</a>
  <!-- XXXrelease
  <li><a href="https://clang.llvm.org">LLVM/Clang</a>
  -->
  <li><a href="https://gcc.gnu.org">GCC</a>
  <li><a href="https://www.perl.org">Perl</a>
  <li><a href="https://www.nlnetlabs.nl/projects/nsd">NSD</a> and
      <a href="https://www.nlnetlabs.nl/projects/unbound">Unbound</a>
  <li><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/ncurses">ncurses</a>
  <li><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/binutils">binutils</a>
  <li><a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/gdb.html">gdb</a>
</ul>

The OpenBSD team often patches third party products, typically to improve the
security or quality of the code.
Much <a href="../innovations.html">home-grown software</a> is also included.
Additional applications are available as <a href="faq15.html">packages</a>.

<h3 id="HowAbout">Why is/isn't <i>ProductX</i> included?</h3>

People often ask why a particular product is or isn't included with OpenBSD.
The answer is based on two things: the wishes of the developers and
compatibility with the <a href="../goals.html">goals</a> of the project.
Licensing is often the biggest problem: we want OpenBSD to remain usable
by any person anywhere in the world for any purpose.

<h3 id="Next">When is the next release?</h3>

The OpenBSD team makes a new release approximately every six months, with the
target release dates in May and November.
More information on the development cycle can be found
<a href="faq5.html#Flavors">here</a>.

<h2 id="Platforms">Hardware support</h2>

OpenBSD runs on the following <a href="../plat.html">platforms</a>:
<!-- XXXrelease - verify platform list is current -->

<ul>
  <li><a href="../alpha.html"   >alpha</a>
  <li><a href="../amd64.html"   >amd64</a>
  <!--
  <li><a href="../arm64.html"   >arm64</a>
  -->
  <li><a href="../armv7.html"   >armv7</a>
  <li><a href="../hppa.html"    >hppa</a>
  <li><a href="../i386.html"    >i386</a>
  <li><a href="../landisk.html" >landisk</a>
  <li><a href="../loongson.html">loongson</a>
  <li><a href="../luna88k.html" >luna88k</a>
  <li><a href="../macppc.html"  >macppc</a>
  <li><a href="../octeon.html"  >octeon</a>
  <li><a href="../sgi.html"     >sgi</a>
  <li><a href="../sparc64.html" >sparc64</a>
</ul>

People sometimes ask why we support so many odd machines.
The short answer is "because we want to."
If enough skilled people (and sometimes "enough" is only one really skilled
person!) wish to maintain support for a platform, it will be supported.
The OpenBSD platforms include 32-bit and 64-bit processors, little and big
endian machines and many different designs.
Supporting unusual platforms has helped produce a higher-quality code base.

<h2 id="Support">Supporting the project</h2>

We are greatly indebted to the people and organizations that have
contributed to the OpenBSD project.

<p>
OpenBSD has a constant need for several types of support from the community.
If you find OpenBSD useful, you are strongly encouraged to find a way to
contribute.

<ul>
  <li><a href="../orders.html">Buy OpenBSD products</a>.
      A number of items are available at the
      <a href="https://openbsdstore.com">OpenBSD store</a>, including
      <a href="../tshirts.html">shirts</a> for your wearing enjoyment.
  <li><a href="../donations.html">Donate money</a>.
      The project has a constant need for cash to pay for equipment, network
      connectivity, etc.
      Even small donations make a profound difference.
  <li><a href="../want.html">Donate equipment and parts</a>.
      The project has a constant need for general and specific hardware.
  <li><a href="faq5.html#Diff">Donate your time and skills</a>.
      Programmers who enjoy writing operating systems are naturally always
      welcome, but there are many other ways that people can be useful.
  <li>Follow the <a href="../mail.html">mailing lists</a> and help answer
      questions from other users.
  <li>Help maintain documentation by submitting new FAQ material to
      <a href="mailto:misc@@openbsd.org">misc@@openbsd.org</a>.
  <li>Form a local <a href="../groups.html">user group</a> and get your friends
      hooked on OpenBSD.
  <li>Make a case to your employer for using OpenBSD at work.
      If you're a student, talk to your professors about using OpenBSD as a
      learning tool for Computer Science or Engineering courses.
</ul>

<h2 id="MailLists">Mailing lists</h2>

The OpenBSD project maintains several mailing lists that users can subscribe
to and follow.
Some of the more popular lists are:

<ul>
  <li><b>announce</b> - Announcements and security advisories.
  <li><b>bugs</b> - Bugs received via
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sendbug">sendbug(1)</a>
      and discussion about them.
  <li><b>misc</b> - General user questions and answers.
      This is the most active list, and should be the "default" for most
      questions and discussion.
  <li><b>ports</b> - Discussion of the <a href="faq15.html">ports tree</a>.
  <li><b>source-changes</b> - Automated mailing of CVS source tree changes.
      Every time a developer commits a change to the OpenBSD source, xenocara
      or www tree, CVS will send out a copy of the commit message via this list.
  <li><b>tech</b> - Discussion of technical topics for OpenBSD developers and
      advanced users.
</ul>

Before posting a question on any mailing list, please check the archives for
most common questions have been asked repeatedly.
While it might be the first time you have encountered the problem or question,
others on the mailing lists may have seen the same question several times in the
last week, and may not appreciate seeing it again.
If asking a question possibly related to hardware, always include a full

<h2 id="ManPages">Manual pages</h2>

OpenBSD comes with extensive documentation in the form of man pages.
They are the authoritative source of information for OpenBSD, and considerable
effort is made to ensure they're up to date and accurate.
Developers making a change to the system are expected to update the man pages
along with their change to the system code.
It is expected that users will check the man pages before asking for help.

<p>
Here is a list of some useful manual pages for new users:

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/afterboot">afterboot(8)</a>
  - things to check after the first complete boot.
  <li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/help">help(1)</a>
  - help for new users and administrators.
  <li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/hier">hier(7)</a>
  - layout of filesystems.
  <li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/man">man(1)</a>
  - display the manual pages.
  <li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/adduser">adduser(8)</a> and
  <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/rmuser">rmuser(8)</a>
  - add or remove new users.
  <li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/reboot">reboot(8), halt(8)</a> and
  <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/shutdown">shutdown(8)</a>
  - stop and restart the system.
  <li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/dmesg">dmesg(8)</a>
  - redisplay the kernel boot messages.
  <li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/doas">doas(1)</a>
  - run commands as another user.
  <li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tmux">tmux(1)</a>
  - terminal multiplexer.
  <li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ifconfig">ifconfig(8)</a>
  - configure network interface parameters.
  <li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/login.conf">login.conf(5)</a>
  - format of the login class configuration file.
  <li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sendbug">sendbug(1)</a>
  - report a bug you've found.
</ul>

You can find all the OpenBSD man pages on the web at
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org">https://man.openbsd.org</a> as well as on
your computer if you installed the <tt>manXX.tgz</tt> file set.

<p>
In general, if you know the name of a command or a manual page, you can
read it by executing <tt>man command</tt>.
If you don't know the name of the command, or if <tt>man command</tt> doesn't
find the manual page, you can search the manual page database by executing
<tt>apropos something</tt> or <tt>man -k something</tt>, where
<tt>something</tt> is a likely word that might appear in the title of the manual
page you're looking for.

<blockquote><pre>
$ <b>apropos "time zone"</b>
tzfile(5) - time zone information
zdump(8) - time zone dumper
zic(8) - time zone compiler
</pre></blockquote>

The parenthetical numbers indicate the section of the manual in which that page
can be found.
In some cases, you may find manual pages with identical names living in separate
sections of the manual.
For example, assume that you want to know the format of the configuration files
for the cron daemon.
Once you know the section of the manual for the page you want, you would execute
<tt>man n command</tt>, where n is the manual section number.

<blockquote><pre>
$ <b>man -k cron</b>
cron(8) - clock daemon
crontab(1) - maintain crontab files for individual users
crontab(5) - tables for driving cron
$ <b>man 5 crontab</b>
</pre></blockquote>

<h3>How do I get a man page with no control characters?</h3>

If you pipe the output of the man command to your editor, you will see that it
contains a lot of control characters.
To remove them, issue

<blockquote><pre>
$ <b>man &lt;command&gt; | col -b</b>
</pre></blockquote>

<h3>How can I get a print-ready copy of a man page?</h3>

If you wish to print out a man page, the printer-friendly formats <tt>.ps</tt>
or <tt>.pdf</tt> are available.

<blockquote><pre>
$ <b>man -Tps &lt;command&gt; &gt; outfile.ps</b>
</pre></blockquote>

Replace <tt>ps</tt> with <tt>pdf</tt> if you prefer the latter.

<h3>What are info files?</h3>

Some of the documentation for OpenBSD comes in the form of
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/info">info(1)</a> files.
This is an alternative form of documentation provided by GNU.
For example, to view information about the GNU compiler,
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/gcc">gcc(1)</a>, type:

<blockquote><pre>
$ <b>info gcc</b>
</pre></blockquote>

After using info, you will really appreciate our man pages!

<h2 id="Bugs">Reporting bugs</h2>

Reporting bugs is one of the most important responsibilities of end users.
Very detailed information is required to diagnose most serious issues.
For example, the following would be an appropriate bug report:

<blockquote><pre>
From: user@@example.com
To: bugs@@openbsd.org
Subject: 3.3-beta panics on a SPARCStation2

OpenBSD 3.2 installed from an official CD-ROM installed and ran fine
on this machine.

After doing a clean install of 3.3-beta from a mirror, I find the
system randomly panics after a period of use, and predictably and
quickly when starting X.

This is the dmesg output:

[...]

This is the panic I got when attempting to start X:

panic: pool_get(mclpl): free list modified: magic=78746572; page 0xfaa93000;
 item addr 0xfaa93000

https://www.openbsd.org/ddb.html describes the minimum info required in bug
reports. Insufficient info makes it difficult to find and fix bugs.

<h2 id="OtherUnixes">Migrating to OpenBSD</h2>

If you learned Unix from any of the <a href="../books.html">good books</a>
on general Unix, understanding the Unix philosophy and then extending your
knowledge to a particular platform, you will find OpenBSD to be familiar.

<p>
Here are some of the commonly encountered differences between OpenBSD and other
Unix variants.

<ul>
  <li>OpenBSD is a BSD-style Unix, following the 4.4BSD design closely.
      Linux and Solaris are System V style systems.
      Some Unix-like operating systems mix System V and BSD characteristics.
      A common place where this causes confusion is the
      <a href="faq10.html#rc">startup scripts</a>.
      OpenBSD uses the <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/rc">rc(8)</a> system.
  <li>OpenBSD is a complete system, intended to be kept in sync.
      It is not a kernel plus utilities that can be upgraded separately from
      each other.
  <li>OpenBSD maintains a <a href="faq15.html#Ports">ports tree</a> to provide
      third party software.
      Pre-compiled <a href="faq15.html#PkgMgmt">packages</a> are created and
      distributed by the OpenBSD ports team.
  <li>OpenBSD uses CVS to keep track of source code changes.
      OpenBSD pioneered <a href="../anoncvs.html">anonymous CVS</a>, which
      allows anyone to extract the full source tree for any version of OpenBSD
      at any time.
      There also is a <a href="https://cvsweb.openbsd.org">web interface</a>.
  <li>OpenBSD has gone through heavy and continual security auditing to ensure
      the quality and security of the code.
  <li>OpenBSD does not support journaling filesystems.
      Instead we use the <a href="faq14.html#SoftUpdates">soft updates</a>
      feature of the Fast File System (FFS).
  <li>OpenBSD comes with <a href="pf/index.html">Packet Filter (PF)</a>.
      This means that Network Address Translation, queuing, and filtering are
      handled through <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pfctl">pfctl(8)</a>,
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pf">pf(4)</a> and
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pf.conf">pf.conf(5)</a>.
  <li>OpenBSD's default shell is <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ksh">ksh</a>,
      which is based on the public domain Korn shell.
      Shells such as bash and many others can be added from
      <a href="faq15.html#PkgMgmt">packages</a>.
  <li>Devices are named by driver, not by type.
      In other words, there are no <tt>eth0</tt> and <tt>eth1</tt> devices.
      It would be <tt>em0</tt> for an Intel PRO/1000 Ethernet card,
      <tt>bge0</tt> for a Broadcom BCM57xx or BCM590x Ethernet device,
      <tt>ral0</tt> for a RaLink wireless device, etc.
  <li>OpenBSD/i386, amd64, and several other platforms use a two-layer disk
      partitioning system, where the first layer is the
      <a href="faq14.html#fdisk">fdisk</a> BIOS-visible partition and the
      second is the <a href="faq14.html#disklabel">disklabel</a>.
  <li>Some other operating systems encourage you to customize your kernel for
      your machine.
      OpenBSD users are encouraged to simply use the standard GENERIC kernel
      provided and tested by the developers.
</ul>

<h3 id="Next">When is the next release?</h3>

The OpenBSD team makes a new release approximately every six months, with the
target release dates in May and November.
More information on the development cycle can be found
<a href="faq5.html#Flavors">here</a>.

<h2 id="Platforms">Hardware support</h2>

OpenBSD runs on the following <a href="../plat.html">platforms</a>:
<!-- XXXrelease - verify platform list is current -->

<ul>
  <li><a href="../alpha.html"   >alpha</a>
  <li><a href="../amd64.html"   >amd64</a>

  <li><a href="../sgi.html"     >sgi</a>
  <li><a href="../sparc64.html" >sparc64</a>
</ul>

People sometimes ask why we support so many odd machines.
The short answer is "because we want to."
If enough skilled people (and sometimes "enough" is only one really skilled
person!) wish to maintain support for a platform, it will be supported.
The OpenBSD platforms include 32 bit and 64 bit processors, little and big
endian machines and many different designs.
Supporting unusual platforms has helped produce a higher-quality code base.

This includes the ability to reuse most parts of the OpenBSD source tree, either
for personal or commercial purposes.
OpenBSD includes no further restrictions other than those implied by the
original BSD license.
Software which is written under stricter licenses cannot be included in the
regular distribution of OpenBSD.
This is intended to safeguard the free use of OpenBSD.
For example, OpenBSD can be freely used for personal use, for academic use, by
government institutions, by non-profit making organizations and by commercial
organizations.
OpenBSD, or parts of it, can also be freely incorporated into commercial

<h3>Selecting hardware</h3>

Selecting appropriate hardware to run your OpenBSD system on is important, as it
can mean the difference between success and failure of a project.

<ul>
  <li><b>Let the application choose the hardware:</b>
      It is usually better to make an adjustment to the hardware you were
      planning on using rather than compromising on your application design
      because you have something you really wanted to use.
  <li><b>Identify your bottlenecks:</b>
      Don't pay extra for the cutting-edge processor if your application is
      restricted by disk I/O.
      Don't pay for fast disks if your system is restricted by network speed.
  <li><b>Keep it simple:</b>
      Simple hardware usually has simple problems.
      Complex hardware that isn't supposed to ever break may take you a long
      time to repair when it breaks anyway.
  <li><b>Use multiple disks:</b>
      Instead of buying one large disk, buy multiple smaller disks.
      While this may cost more, distributing the load over multiple spindles
      will decrease the amount of time necessary to access data on the disks.
      With more spindles, you can get more reliability and faster data access
      with RAID.
  <li><b>Avoid cheap network adapters:</b>
      OpenBSD supports a plethora of cheap network adapters.
      These adapters work great in home systems and low or moderate throughput
      business and research environments.
      If you need high throughput and low impact on your server, you are better
      off buying a quality network adapter.
</ul>

</pre></blockquote>

Repeat the <tt>machine ddbcpu x</tt> followed by <tt>trace</tt> for each
processor in your machine.

<h3>How do I gather further information from a kernel crash?</h3><p>

A typical kernel crash on OpenBSD might look like this:
(things to watch for are marked with bold font)

<blockquote><pre>
kernel: page fault trap, code=0
Stopped at    <b>_pf_route+0x263</b>:        mov     0x40(%edi),%edx
ddb>
</pre></blockquote>

The first command to run from the <tt>ddb></tt> prompt is <tt>trace</tt>
(see <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/ddb">ddb(4)</a> for details):

<blockquote><pre>
ddb> <b>trace</b>
<b>_pf_route</b>(e28cb7e4,e28bc978,2,1fad,d0b8b120) at <b>_pf_route+0x263</b>

Bad frame pointer: 0xe28cbcac
ddb>
</pre></blockquote>

This tells us what function calls lead to the crash.<p>

To find out the particular line of C code that caused the crash, you can
do the following:

<p>
Find the source file where the crashing function is defined in.
In this example, that would be <tt>pf_route()</tt> in <tt>sys/net/pf.c</tt>.
Recompile that source file with debug information:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>cd /usr/src/sys/arch/$(uname -m)/compile/GENERIC</b>
# <b>rm pf.o</b>
# <b>DEBUG=-g make pf.o</b>
</pre></blockquote>

Then use <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/objdump">objdump(1)</a> to get the
disassembly:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>objdump --line --disassemble --reloc pf.o &gt;pf.dis</b>
</pre></blockquote>

In the output, grep for the function name:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>grep "&lt;_pf_route&gt;:" pf.dis</b>
0000<b>7d88</b> &lt;_pf_route&gt;:
</pre></blockquote>

Take this first hex number and add the offset from the <tt>Stopped at</tt> line:
<tt>0x7d88 + 0x263 == 0x7feb</tt>.

<p>
Scroll down to that line (the assembler instruction should match the one
quoted in the <tt>Stopped at</tt> line), then up to the nearest C line number:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>more pf.dis</b>
/usr/src/sys/arch/i386/compile/GENERIC/../../../../net/pf.c:<b>3872</b>
    7fe7:       0f b7 43 02             movzwl 0x2(%ebx),%eax
    <b>7feb</b>:       8b 57 40                mov    0x40(%edi),%edx
    7fee:       39 d0                   cmp    %edx,%eax
    7ff0:       0f 87 92 00 00 00       ja     8088 &lt;_pf_route+0x300&gt;
</pre></blockquote>

So, it's precisely line <tt>3872</tt> of <tt>pf.c</tt> that crashes:

<blockquote><pre>
# <b>cat -n pf.c | head -n 3872 | tail -n 1</b>
3872          if ((u_int16_t)ip-&gt;ip_len &lt;= ifp-&gt;if_mtu) {
</pre></blockquote>

Note that the kernel that produced the crash output and the object file
for objdump must be compiled from the exact same source file, otherwise
the offsets won't match.

<p>
If you provide both the ddb trace output and the relevant objdump section,
that's very helpful.

<h3>How do I get more useful info for developers?</h3>
a518 6
Here are a few additional tips:

<p>
<b>Lost the "panic" message?</b>

<p>
a520 3
This is a very important message, so you want to report it as well.
You can get this back by using the "show panic" command in <tt>ddb></tt>
like this:
d528 1
a528 1
In this case, the panic string was "Kernel: page fault trap, code=0".
a529 4
<p>
<b>Note for SMP systems</b>

<p>
d570 2
a571 3
The first command to run from the <tt>ddb></tt> prompt is "trace"
(see <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/ddb">ddb(4)</a>
for details):
d596 1
a596 1
In this example, that would be pf_route() in sys/net/pf.c.
d605 2
a606 2
Then use <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/objdump">objdump(1)</a>
to get the disassembly:
d612 1
a612 1
In the output, grep for the function name (pf_route in our example):
d619 2
a620 2
Take this first hex number and add the offset from the 'Stopped at' line:
<b>0x7d88</b> + <b>0x263</b> == <b>0x7feb</b>.
d624 1
a624 1
quoted in the 'Stopped at' line), then up to the nearest C line number:
d635 1
a635 1
So, it's precisely line <b>3872</b> of pf.c that crashes:

However, if this is your first OpenBSD experience, be realistic: you probably
did not discover an unknown problem.
Sometimes faulty hardware can mimic a software bug, so verify the current
condition of your hardware before deciding you have found a bug.

<p>
d494 9
a502 17
See <a href="../report.html">report.html</a> for more information on
creating and submitting bug reports.
Detailed information about your hardware is necessary if you think the bug
<i>could be in any way</i> related to your hardware or hardware configuration.
Usually, <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/dmesg">dmesg(8)</a> output is
sufficient in this respect.
A detailed description of your problem is necessary.
You will note that the dmesg described the hardware, the text explained why
Smart User thought the system was not broken (ran 3.2 properly), how this
crash was caused (starting X), and the output of the debugger's
<tt>ps</tt> and <tt>trace</tt> commands.
In this case, Smart User provided output captured on a
<a href="faq7.html#SerCon">serial console</a>.
If you cannot do that, take a picture of the screen and attach it to your bug
report.
(This was a real problem, and the information in the above report helped
lead to a repair of this issue which impacted Sun4c systems.)
a504 10
If Smart User had a working OpenBSD system, they would have used the
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/sendbug">sendbug(1)</a> utility to submit
his bug report.
Obviously, you can't use
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/sendbug">sendbug(1)</a>
when your system won't boot, but you should use it whenever possible.
You will still need to include detailed information about what happened,
the exact configuration of your system, and how to reproduce the problem.
The <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/sendbug">sendbug(1)</a> command requires
that your system be able to send email.

<h3>How do I get color man pages on XTerm?</h3>

The default configuration file for
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/xterm">xterm(1)</a> does not display color man
pages.
In order to get color output, copy the file
<tt>/usr/X11R6/share/X11/app-defaults/XTerm-color</tt>
to your home directory, and rename it <tt>.Xdefaults-XTerm-color</tt>.
The color XTerm defaults file can now be activated by adding the following
line to <tt>.Xdefaults</tt> in your home directory:

<blockquote><pre>
#include ".Xdefaults-XTerm-color"
</pre></blockquote>

This file contains all the settings you need to enable color in XTerm.
However, three lines need to be uncommented by removing the leading "!":

<blockquote><pre>
!*VT100*colorULMode: on
!*VT100*underLine: off
!*VT100*colorBDMode: on
</pre></blockquote>

The rest of the included file allows you to choose colors for various settings.
The ones relevant to the man pages are:

<blockquote><pre>
*VT100*colorUL: yellow
*VT100*colorBD: white
</pre></blockquote>

That produces rather hellish looking man pages.
We suggest red for colorUL and magenta for colorBD.

X11 also provides the <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/xman">xman(1)</a>
graphical interface to the manual pages.

The <a href="../index.html">OpenBSD</a> project produces a freely
available, multi-platform 4.4BSD-based UNIX-like operating system.
Our <a href="../goals.html">goals</a> place emphasis on correctness,
security, standardization, and portability.

New users frequently want to know whether OpenBSD is superior to some
other free UNIX-like operating systems.
That question is largely unanswerable, and is the subject of countless
(and useless) religious debates.

<p>
Below are some reasons why we think OpenBSD is a useful operating system:
d56 5
a60 5
  <li>OpenBSD is thought of by many security professionals as the
      most <a href="../security.html">secure</a> UNIX-like operating system,
      as a result of a never-ending comprehensive source code security audit.
  <li>OpenBSD is a full-featured UNIX-like operating system available
      in source form at no charge.
d65 3
a67 3
  <li>OpenBSD benefits from strong ongoing development in many areas,
      offering opportunities to work with emerging technologies with an
      international community of programmers and end users.
d69 2
a70 4
      For the vast majority of users, OpenBSD "Just Works" on their hardware
      for their application.
      Not only is tweaking and customizing rarely needed, it is actively
      discouraged.
a72 3
However, whether OpenBSD is right for you is a question that only you
can answer.

d75 2
a76 2
The OpenBSD team makes a new release every six months, with target release
dates in May and November.
a78 2
This FAQ only covers the most recent release.

a101 1
<p>
d110 1
a110 1
People sometimes ask why we support so many "odd" machines.
d114 3
a116 7
There are practical benefits to keeping OpenBSD multi-platform: when new
platforms come out, the code tree is relatively free of portability-breaking
bugs and design flaws.
The OpenBSD platforms include 32 bit and 64 bit processors, little and
big endian machines, and many different designs.
And yes, supporting "unusual" platforms has helped produce a higher-quality
code base for more common platforms too.
d120 2
a121 18
Selecting appropriate hardware to run your OpenBSD system on is important,
as it can mean the difference between success and failure of a project.

<p>
If you are shopping for a new PC, whether you are buying it piece by piece
or completely pre-built, you want to make sure first that you are buying
reliable parts.
In the PC world, this is not easy.
<b>Bad or otherwise unreliable or mismatched parts can make OpenBSD run
poorly and crash often</b>.
The best advice we can give is to be careful, and buy brands and parts that
have been reviewed by an authority you trust.
Sometimes a more expensive machine is a better quality machine.
Other times it is not.

<p>
There are certain things that will help bring out the maximum performance
of your system:
d127 1
a127 1
      because you have something you "really wanted to use."
a135 5
  <li><b>Use hardware you understand, or learn the new hardware before you
      implement a production system:</b>
      Regardless of the technical merits of the hardware, committing to use
      a particular type of hardware before you have become familiar with it,
      both how it works <i>and how it fails</i>, is foolish.
a141 11
  <li><b>Break up large blocks of storage:</b>
      Many people make the mistake of designing a system that stores large
      amounts of data to have one "big block" of storage.
      This is usually a bad design.
      You will usually find it much better to break up your storage into
      manageable blocks.
      This has many advantages, two of the biggest being that you can add more
      storage later when you need it easily (you weren't going to get the
      requirements estimate right, no one ever does), and you can buy a small
      amount of storage now, then add much more later when the price will have
      most likely dropped and the capacity will have increased.
a147 5
      Unfortunately, some name-brand adapters are not much better than the
      cheap adapters, and some potentially good adapters do not have accurate
      documentation available to write good drivers.
      Gigabit adapters often perform better than 10Mbps/100Mbps adapters, even
      when used on slower speed networks, due to superior buffering.
d157 3
a159 3
This includes the ability to REUSE most parts of the OpenBSD source tree,
either for personal or commercial purposes.
OpenBSD includes NO further restrictions other than those implied by the
d161 2
a162 2
Software which is written under stricter licenses cannot be included in
the regular distribution of OpenBSD.
d164 5
a168 18
For example, OpenBSD can be freely used for personal use, for academic use,
by government institutions, by non-profit making organizations and by
commercial organizations.
OpenBSD, or parts of it, can also be freely incorporated into
commercial products.

<p>
People sometimes ask if it bothers us that our free work is put into
commercial products.
The answer is that we would prefer that our good code be <i>widely used</i>
rather than have commercial software vendors reimplement and create badly
coded or incompatible alternative solutions to already solved problems.
For example, it is likely that SSH is a widely used protocol due to
this freedom, much more widely used than if restrictions had been placed
on how people used the OpenSSH code.
If a free SSH solution was not available for vendors to use (in their
multitude of rapidly developed products), they would have written or
purchased some crummy off-the shelf version instead.
d173 2
a174 3
In fact, it is stunning how little support of any kind comes from
companies that depend upon OpenBSD (or OpenSSH) for their products,
but there is no requirement of compensation.
d181 4
a184 6
The maintainers of OpenBSD support the project largely from their own
pockets.
This includes the time spent programming for the project, equipment used
to support the many ports, the network resources used to distribute OpenBSD
to you, and the time spent answering questions and investigating users' bug
reports.

As can be seen, the OpenBSD team often patches third party products,
typically to improve the security or quality of the code.
In some cases, the user will see no difference in operation.
In other cases, there ARE operational differences which may impact some users.
Keep these enhancements in mind before blindly adding different versions of
the same software.
You may get a bigger version number but a less secure system.

<p>
Much <a href="../innovations.html">home-grown software</a> is also included,
and additional applications can be added through the OpenBSD
<a href="faq15.html">packages and ports</a> system.
d213 1
a213 2
People often ask why a particular product is or isn't included with
OpenBSD.
a215 6
A product will not be included simply because it is "nifty" -- it must
also be "free" for use, distribution and modification by our standards.
A product must also be stable and secure -- a bigger version number does
not always mean a better product.

<p>
a218 16
<p>
Another major consideration is the wishes of the developers.
The OpenBSD developers are the ultimate judges of what does and doesn't
go into the project.
Just because an application is "good" doesn't mean the OpenBSD project
wishes to devote the resources needed to maintaining it, or that
they will share other's enthusiasm about its place in OpenBSD.

<p>
Of course, if you wish to use one of these packages and your use is
compatible with the license of the products, no one will stop you.
That wouldn't be very free if we tried, would it?
However, your needs may change -- you may not want to develop a
"Killer Application" that you can't sell, distribute, or get rich from
because you incorporated non-free software into it.

OpenBSD comes with extensive documentation in the form of manual pages.
Considerable effort is made to make sure the man pages are up-to-date
and accurate.
In all cases, the man pages are considered the authoritative source of
information for OpenBSD.

<p>
To access the manual pages, be sure that you
installed the correct <a href="faq4.html#FilesNeeded">file set</a>.

The parenthetical numbers indicate the section of the manual in which
that page can be found.
In some cases, you may find manual pages with identical names living in
separate sections of the manual.
For example, assume that you want to know the format of the configuration
files for the cron daemon.
Once you know the section of the manual for the page you want, you would
execute <tt>man n command</tt>, where n is the manual section number.

<h3>How do I display a man page source file (i.e. one whose filename

d435 3
a437 12
These are found throughout the src tree and are installed to man page
directories like <tt>/usr/share/man/man1</tt> in their unformatted state.
To view these pages, simply do:

<blockquote><pre>
$ <b>mandoc -a &lt;file&gt;</b>
</pre></blockquote>

<h3>How do I get a plain man page with no formatting or control
characters?</h3>

This is helpful to get the man page straight, with no non-printable characters.

<h3>How can I get a PostScript copy of a man page that's print-ready?</h3>
d445 2
a446 6
The PostScript versions of the man pages look very nice.
They can be printed or viewed on-screen with a program like gv (GhostView).
GhostView can be found in our <a href="faq15.html">packages collection</a>.
Use the following <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/mandoc.1">mandoc(1)</a>
command options for getting a PostScript version from an OpenBSD system
man page:
d449 1
a449 1
$ <b>mandoc -Tps &lt;file&gt; &gt; outfile.ps</b>
d452 1
a452 2
Note that <tt>&lt;file&gt;</tt> must be the man page source file (probably a
file that ends in a number, e.g. <tt>tcpdump.8</tt>).
d456 2
a457 2
Some of the documentation for OpenBSD comes in the form of info files,
typically contained in <tt>/usr/share/info</tt>.
a458 3
Many of these files are more up to date than the manual pages provided by GNU,
and can be accessed with the <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/info">info(1)</a>
command.

a472 2
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/xterm">xterm(1)</a> does not display color

That produces rather hellish looking man pages, so customize as necessary:
may we suggest red for "colorUL" and magenta for "colorBD"?

There is also a man page viewer for X11 available,
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/xman">xman(1)</a>, which provides an
alternative (graphical) interface to the manual pages.

<h2 id="Desktop">OpenBSD on the desktop</h2>

The question "can I use OpenBSD on my desktop" is often asked in exactly
this manner, with no explanation of what "desktop" requirements entail.
The only person who can answer that question is you, as it depends on
what your needs and expectations are.

<p>
While OpenBSD has a great reputation as a "server" operating system, it
can be (and is) used on the desktop.
Many "desktop" applications are available through <a href="faq15.html">
packages and ports</a>.
As with all operating system decisions, the question is: can it do the
job you desire in the way you wish?
You must answer this question for yourself.

<p>
It might be worth noting that a large amount of OpenBSD development is
done on laptops running OpenBSD.

<ul>
    <li><a href="../orders.html">Buy an OpenBSD CD set</a>.
    It includes the current full release of OpenBSD and is bootable on
    many platforms.
    It also generates revenue to support the OpenBSD project, and reduces
    the strain on network resources used to deliver the distribution via
    the Internet.
    This inexpensive three CD set includes the full source.
    Your friends could also use a copy!
    <li><a href="../donations.html">Donate money</a>.
    The project has a constant need for cash to pay for equipment, network
    connectivity, and expenses relating to CD publishing.
    Manufacturing CDs requires an up-front out-of-pocket investment for the
    OpenBSD developers, without guaranteed return.
    Send an email to <a href="mailto:donations@@openbsd.org">
    donations@@openbsd.org</a> to find out how to contribute.
    Even small donations make a profound difference.
    <li><a href="../want.html">Donate equipment and parts</a>.
    The project has a constant need for general and specific hardware.
    Items such as SCSI, SATA and SAS disks and various types of RAM are
    always welcome.
    For other types of hardware such as computer systems and motherboards,
    you should inquire as to current need.
    Write to <a href="mailto:donations@@openbsd.org">donations@@openbsd.org</a>
    to arrange the shipment.
    <li>Donate your time and skills.
    Programmers who enjoy writing operating systems are naturally always
    welcome, but there are dozens of other ways that people can be useful.
    Follow the <a href="../mail.html">mailing lists</a> and help answer
    questions from new users.
    <li>Help maintain documentation by submitting new FAQ material
    (to <a href="mailto:misc@@openbsd.org">misc@@openbsd.org</a>).
    Form a local <a href="../groups.html">users group</a> and get your
    friends hooked on OpenBSD.
    Make a case to your employer for using OpenBSD at work.
    If you're a student, talk to your professors about using OpenBSD as
    a learning tool for Computer Science or Engineering courses.
    It's also worth mentioning one of the most important ways you should
    not try to "help" the OpenBSD project: do not waste your time engaging
    in operating system flame wars.
    It does not help the project to find new users and can cause substantial
    harm to important relationships that developers have with other developers.

<h2 id="Desktop">Can I use OpenBSD as a desktop system?</h2>

This question is often asked in exactly this manner, with no explanation
of what "desktop" requirements entail.
The only person who can answer that question is you, as it depends on
what your needs and expectations are.

<p>
While OpenBSD has a great reputation as a "server" operating system, it
can be (and is) used on the desktop.
Many "desktop" applications are available through <a href="faq15.html">
packages and ports</a>.
As with all operating system decisions, the question is: can it do the
job you desire in the way you wish?
You must answer this question for yourself.

<p>
It might be worth noting that a large amount of OpenBSD development is
done on laptops running OpenBSD.

<h2 id="HowAbout">Why is/isn't <i>ProductX</i> included?</h2>

<h2 id="BuyCD">Buying an OpenBSD CD set</h2>

Purchasing an OpenBSD CD set is generally the best way to get started.
Visit the <a href= "../orders.html">ordering page</a> to purchase your copy.

<p>
There are many good reasons to own an OpenBSD CD set:

<ul>
  <li>CD sales support ongoing development of OpenBSD.
  <li>Development of a multi-platform operating system requires constant
      investment in equipment.
  <li>Your support in the form of a CD set purchase has a real impact on
      future development.
  <li>The CDs contains binaries (and source) for the most popular supported
      platforms.
  <li>The CDs are bootable on several platforms, and can be used to bootstrap
      a machine without a pre-existing installed operating system.
  <li>The CDs are useful for bootstrapping even if you choose to install a
      snapshot.
  <li>Installing from CD is faster and preserves bandwidth.
  <li>OpenBSD CDs always come with very nice artwork and stickers.
      Your system isn't fully complete without these.
      You can only get these stickers by buying a CD set.
  <li>The CD set is complete enough to bring up a full development environment
      without any network connection at all.
</ul>

If you're installing a release version of OpenBSD, you should use an official
CD set.

<h2 id="BuyTShirts">Buying OpenBSD shirts</h2>

Yes, OpenBSD has T-shirts for your wearing enjoyment!
You can view them <a href="../tshirts.html">here</a>.

<h2 id="Download">Downloading OpenBSD</h2>

There are numerous international mirror sites offering access to OpenBSD
releases and snapshots.
You should always use the site nearest to you.
Before you begin fetching a release or snapshot, you may wish to use
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/ping">ping(8)</a> and
<a href="http://man.openbsd.org/traceroute">traceroute(8)</a> to determine
which mirror site is nearest to you, and whether that mirror is performing
adequately.
Access information can be found <a href= "../ftp.html">here</a>.
Of course, your OpenBSD release CD is always closer than any mirror.

<p>
In the same directory as the installation sets, each mirror includes a file
named <tt>SHA256</tt> that contains checksums of the various installation
files.
You can confirm that none of the downloaded files were mangled in transit
using the <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/sha256">sha256(1)</a> command.

<blockquote><pre>
$ <b>sha256 -c SHA256</b>
</pre></blockquote>

However, this only checks for <i>accidental</i> corruption.
You can use <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/signify">signify(1)</a>
to cryptographically verify the downloaded files.

<blockquote><pre>
$ <b>signify -Cp /etc/signify/openbsd-XX-base.pub -x SHA256.sig install*.iso</b>
Signature Verified
installXX.iso: OK
</pre></blockquote>

This will verify the <tt>installXX.iso</tt> file, for example.
Replace "XX" with the version of OpenBSD that you're verifying.
Note that you will need the public key files for OpenBSD's base system
(and the signify program!) in order to do this.

<h2 id="SelectHW">Selecting hardware</h2>

Selecting appropriate hardware to run your OpenBSD system on is important,
as it can mean the difference between success and failure of a project.

<p>
If you are shopping for a new PC, whether you are buying it piece by piece
or completely pre-built, you want to make sure first that you are buying
reliable parts.
In the PC world, this is not easy.
<b>Bad or otherwise unreliable or mismatched parts can make OpenBSD run
poorly and crash often</b>.
The best advice we can give is to be careful, and buy brands and parts that
have been reviewed by an authority you trust.
Sometimes a more expensive machine is a better quality machine.
Other times it is not.

<p>
There are certain things that will help bring out the maximum performance
of your system:

<ul>
  <li><b>Let the application choose the hardware:</b>
      It is usually better to make an adjustment to the hardware you were
      planning on using rather than compromising on your application design
      because you have something you "really wanted to use."
  <li><b>Identify your bottlenecks:</b>
      Don't pay extra for the cutting-edge processor if your application is
      restricted by disk I/O.
      Don't pay for fast disks if your system is restricted by network speed.
      Don't pay for much of anything if your bottleneck is a 128kbps DSL line.
  <li><b>Keep it simple:</b>
      Simple hardware usually has simple problems.
      Complex hardware that isn't supposed to ever break may take you a long
      time to repair when it breaks anyway.
  <li><b>Use hardware you understand, or learn the new hardware before you
      implement a production system:</b>
      Regardless of the technical merits of the hardware, committing to use
      a particular type of hardware before you have become familiar with it,
      both how it works <i>and how it fails</i>, is foolish.
  <li><b>Use multiple disks:</b>
      Instead of buying one large disk, buy multiple smaller disks.
      While this may cost more, distributing the load over multiple spindles
      will decrease the amount of time necessary to access data on the disks.
      With more spindles, you can get more reliability and faster data access
      with RAID.
  <li><b>Break up large blocks of storage:</b>
      Many people make the mistake of designing a system that stores large
      amounts of data to have one "big block" of storage.
      This is usually a bad design.
      You will usually find it much better to break up your storage into
      manageable blocks.
      This has many advantages, two of the biggest being that you can add more
      storage later when you need it easily (you weren't going to get the
      requirements estimate right, no one ever does), and you can buy a small
      amount of storage now, then add much more later when the price will have
      most likely dropped and the capacity will have increased.
  <li><b>Avoid cheap network adapters:</b>
      OpenBSD supports a plethora of cheap network adapters.
      These adapters work great in home systems and low or moderate throughput
      business and research environments.
      If you need high throughput and low impact on your server, you are better
      off buying a quality network adapter.
      Unfortunately, some name-brand adapters are not much better than the
      cheap adapters, and some potentially good adapters do not have accurate
      documentation available to write good drivers.
      Gigabit adapters often perform better than 10Mbps/100Mbps adapters, even
      when used on slower speed networks, due to superior buffering.

that can be very useful if the faq you're reading only covers one topic,
or if the pages are meant to be read in order. it makes sense to have
them on the pf and smtpd faq pages, but the main faq contains a variety
of unrelated topics, so they're not actually very useful there. remove.

<!-- XXXrelease - do we really need this here? seems redundant -->

The complete list of changes made to OpenBSD 5.7 to create OpenBSD 5.8
can be found on <a href="../plus58.html">plus58.html</a>, and highlights
on the <a href="../58.html">OpenBSD 5.8 information page</a>, however
here are a few changes the OpenBSD team anticipate will require or
warrant some special note to people upgrading or installing OpenBSD 5.8
who are familiar with older versions:

<ul>
<li><b>sudo removed</b> in favor of
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=doas">doas(1)</a>.
sudo is available as a package if needed.
More info on doas(1) can be found <a href="faq10.html#doas">here</a>.

<li><b>Root logins via SSH are actively discouraged.</b>
Default is to prohibit root login via SSH.

<li><b>SSHv1 disabled at compile time.</b>
You shouldn't be using this anyway.
Some other insecure protocols are disabled at runtime (i.e., config file
options can reactivate), but some old clients may notice.
This is a clue you should upgrade your client.

<li><b><a href="faq6.html#OpenNTPD">OpenNTPD</a> active by default on
new installs</b>, and will by default use pool.ntp.org.
You can reconfigure it by editing
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ntpd.conf">

Some commonly asked questions about third party products:

<ul>
<li><i>Why is a web server included? It isn't needed by many people!</i><br>
Because the developers want it.

<p>
<li><i>Why isn't bzip2 included instead of gzip?</i><br>
Performance is horrible, and benefit is minimal.
Impact on slower platforms would be unacceptable.

<p>
<li><i>Why isn't there a graphical or
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=curses">curses(3)</a>
based installer?</i><br>
For a number of reasons, including the goal of keeping the installation
boot media able to be a single floppy disk, the fact that one installer
can be used on all platforms in all configurations, and the fact that
after the second or third OpenBSD install, most users find the OpenBSD
installation system among the fastest and easiest installers of any OS.
Most developers and users greatly prefer the speed, power, and ease of
use of the current installer to any of the more "colorful" or "pretty"
installers on some other platforms.

<p>
<li><i>Will ZFS be added to OpenBSD?</i><br>
Not unless someone can convince Oracle to change the license for it to
something compatible with OpenBSD <a href="../policy.html">policy</a>.

</ul>

In most cases, these topics have been discussed in painful detail on
the <a href="faq2.html#MailLists">mailing lists</a>.

   <li>OpenBSD attempts to minimize the need for customization and

<p>
OpenBSD is all free. The binaries are free. The source is free. All
parts of OpenBSD have reasonable copyright terms permitting free
redistribution.  This includes the ability to REUSE most parts of the
OpenBSD source tree, either for personal or commercial purposes. OpenBSD
includes NO further restrictions other than those implied by the
original BSD license.  Software which is written under stricter licenses
cannot be included in the regular distribution of OpenBSD.  This is
intended to safeguard the free use of OpenBSD.  For example, OpenBSD can
be freely used for personal use, for academic use, by government
institutions, by non-profit making organizations and by commercial
organizations.

@TJ's work on the FAQ continues, this time a big diff with lots of small
fixes:

- only specify the current supported "set debug" choices in the options
  section of the pf faq
- clarify ipv4 vs ipv6 configs in the nat section of the pf faq
- mention that usb disk images are available in addition to the cd isos
- don't say that all donors get their name on the donations page anymore
- replace the last few instances of "ftp mirrors" with "http mirrors" or
  just "mirrors" where appropriate
- reword some 5.8 mentions to reduce the amount of version bumps we have
  to do each release
- few minor tweaks

- remove postfix/djbdns/qmail from the old "common questions" section

<li><b>OpenSSL forked: Welcome LibreSSL</b><br>
The OpenBSD project has forked the historically buggy OpenSSL project
into <a href="libressl.org">LibreSSL</a>.
Great quantities of bad, unsupported, and irrelevant code has been
stripped out, including amazing "exploit mitigation countermeasures" and
the remaining code cleaned up creating a much leaner and more secure
replacement product.
 
<li><b>Improved hardware support:</b><br>

sendmail as default MTA.</b><br>
Sendmail will still be available for this release if your installation
still needs it, but migrating to OpenSMTPD is recommended.

<li><b><a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=pthreads&amp;sektion=3">pthreads(3)</a> support:</b><br>
The most significant change in this release is the replacement of the user-level uthreads by kernel-level rthreads, allowing multithreaded programs to utilize multiple CPUs/cores.

<li><b>RAIDframe and raid(4) support removed</b><br>
Users of RAIDframe will need to rebuild their systems to utilize
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=softraid&amp;sektion=4">softraid(4)</a>
instead.

<li><b>Added
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=nginx&amp;sektion=8">nginx(8)</a></b><br>,
Nginx is an HTTP server, reverse proxy server and mail proxy server.
Ultimately, it is hoped nginx will replace the Apache 1.3-derived httpd
in base OpenBSD.

<li><b>lint(1) has been removed</b><br>

d391 17

<li><i>Why is Sendmail included, it is "known insecure"?!</i><br>
Sendmail has
had an imperfect security record, however the Sendmail authors and
maintainers have been very receptive to reworking their code to make it
much more secure (and this is a sadly uncommon response).
The recent security history of Sendmail is not much different than some
of the supposedly "more secure" alternatives.

<li><b>Synaptics touch pad support:</b><br>
The Synaptics touchpads (used on many laptops) have greatly improved
support now, through the
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=synaptics&amp;sektion=4">synaptics(4)</a>
device and the
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=synclient&amp;sektion=1">synclient(1)</a>
utility.
You may even find OpenBSD provides better support for your trackpad
than the OS that came pre-loaded on your laptop!

<li><b>Base system and Xenocara manuals are now installed as source
code.</b><br>
This makes grep(1) more useful in <tt>/usr/share/man/</tt> and
<tt>/usr/X11R6/man/</tt>.
If both formatted and source versions of a manual page are installed,
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=man&amp;sektion=1">man(1)</a>
automatically displays the newer version of each page.

<li><b>midicat(1) removed:</b><br>
MIDI files can be manipulated and MIDI thru boxes can be created with
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=aucat&amp;sektion=1">aucat(1)</a>.

<li><b>ccd(4) removed:</b><br>
If you were using ccd(4) for concatinated or mirrored disks, you will
need to rebuild using
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=softraid&amp;sektion=4">softraid(4)</a>.

<li><b>Advanced notice: RAIDframe is going away.</b><br>
While RAIDframe is still in OpenBSD 5.1, it will NOT be in OpenBSD 5.2,
so if you are using it, you will need to start thinking about migration
to another solution, most likely
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=softraid&amp;sektion=4">softraid(4)</a>.

diskmap(4) allows you to mount drives by unique disklabel UIDs rather

<h2>1.3 - Why might I want to use OpenBSD?</h2>

<p>
New users frequently want to know whether OpenBSD is superior to some
other free UNIX-like operating system. That question is largely
unanswerable and is the subject of countless (and useless) religious
debates. Do not, under any circumstances, ask such a question on an
OpenBSD mailing list.

<p>
Below are some reasons why we think OpenBSD is a useful operating
system.  Whether OpenBSD is right for you is a question that only you
can answer.

<p>
<ul>
   <li>OpenBSD runs on many <a href="../plat.html">different hardware
   platforms</a>.
   <li>OpenBSD is thought of by many security professionals as the
   most <a href="../security.html">secure</a> UNIX-like operating system:
   <ul>
     <li>A never-ending comprehensive source code security audit.
     <li>ProPolice: protects against stack-smashing attacks
     <li>W^X (Write exclusive or eXecute permissions) (most platforms)
     <li>Randomized memory allocations
   </ul>
   <li>OpenBSD is a full-featured UNIX-like operating system available
   in source form at no charge.
   <li>OpenBSD is distributed with <a href="#ReallyFree">license</a>
   that permits and encourages use, modification, redistribution in both
   free and commercial products.
   <li>OpenBSD integrates cutting-edge security technology suitable for
   building firewalls and <a href="../crypto.html#hardware">private
   network services</a> in a distributed environment.
   <li>OpenBSD benefits from strong ongoing development in many areas,  
   offering opportunities to work with emerging technologies with an
   international community of programmers and end-users.
   <li>OpenBSD attempts to minimize the need for customization and 
   tweaking.
   For the vast majority of users, OpenBSD "Just Works" on their
   hardware for their application.
   Not only is tweaking and customizing rarely needed, it is actively

Linda Larson pointed out that "Is OpenBSD really free?" and "How can I
help support OpenBSD?" really belong together, and "Why might I want to
use OpenBSD" probably belongs before either, so re-order.  No words were
altered in this diff, though a couple section numbers were slightly
inconvenienced.

This will prove to be a problem for many users, and for 4.3, will be
part of <tt>base43.tgz</tt>, but for OpenBSD 4.2, many users will have
to install <tt>xbase42.tgz</tt>.

<li><b>XF3 is no longer included:</b><br>
XF3 was provided on the i386 platform to support some very old display
hardware that is now rarely used.
With the new version of X.org and its new build process, support for
XF3 was dropped.
It is expected few people will be impacted by this.

<li><b>Updated
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ahci&amp;sektion=4">ahci</a>

Systems using the ahci(4) driver may find SATA disks which had been
recognized and handled by the
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=wd&amp;sektion=4">wd(4)</a>
(i.e., wd0) to become
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sd&amp;sektion=4">sd(4)</a>
(i.e., sd0) devices.
More details in the <a href="upgrade42.html#ahci">4.2 Upgrade Guide</a>

<p>
<li><b>SSH protocol 1 discouraged on new installs:</b><br>
New OpenBSD installs will default to not accepting SSH v1 connections.

<p>
<li><b>Changes in the way sudo(8) passes environment:</b><br>
For
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sudo&amp;sektion=8#SECURITY+NOTES"
>security reasons</a>
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sudo&amp;sektion=8">sudo(8)</a>
will now reset the environment to a small default set
with only certain variables preserved from the previous environment.

<p>
<li><b>[i386, amd64] boot(8) enhancements:</b><br>
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=boot&amp;sektion=8&amp;arch=i386">boot(8)</a>
will now ignore any <tt>/etc/boot.conf</tt> file if the CTRL key is held
down when boot starts.
This can be handy for recovering from some configuration errors.
boot(8) for i386 can now boot an amd64 kernel, and vice versa, which can
make changing platforms easier.

<li><b>OpenBSD/sparc64</b><br>
UltraSPARC III-based systems are now supported much better, including
running at full speed.

<p>
<li><b>"flags S/SA keep state" implicit in pf.conf(5)</b><br>
<i>flags S/SA keep state</i> is now the default for pass rules in
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=pf.conf&amp;sektion=5">pf.conf(5)</a>,
and new <i>no state</i> and <i>flags any</i> options have been added to
override these defaults.
Current rulesets will continue to load, but the behaviour may be
slightly changed as these defaults are more restrictive.
Rulesets with stateless filtering (<i>no state</i>) or a requirement to
create states on intermediate packets (<i>flags any</i>) should be
updated to explicitly request the desired behaviour.

<p>
In particular care should be taken with the 
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=enc&amp;sektion=4">enc0</a>
interface, as floating states are a potential problem for filtering IPsec
traffic: states need to be interface bound, to avoid permitting unencrypted
traffic should
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=isakmpd&amp;sektion=8">isakmpd(8)</a>
exit. Therefore all rules on the enc0 interface should explicitly set
<i>keep state (if-bound)</i>.

<p>
<li><b>FreeBSD and NetBSD DOS MBR partitions are no longer used to store
disklabels, and are no longer searched for a disklabel</b><br>
As a result, disks with only FreeBSD or NetBSD DOS MBR partitions will
no longer have an 'a' partition created in the spoofed disklabel.
The disklabel on such disks will be stored and loaded from sector 1, and
this could find an old accidental disklabel.
Use fdisk(8) to change the partition type to OpenBSD ('A6') to use the
existing disklabel.

<p>
<li><b>amd64, i386, macppc, and mvmeppc no longer try to boot from the first
NetBSD partition when no OpenBSD partition is found.</b><br>

Again, use
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=fdisk&amp;sektion=8">fdisk(8)</a>
to change the partition type to OpenBSD ('A6').

<p>
<li><b>New way to enable/disable process accounting on boot</b><br>
In order to enable accounting on boot you need to set the new rc.conf
variable "accounting=YES".
The presence of the /var/account/acct file does not make it start
automatically anymore.

<p>
<li><b>spamd(8):<br>
</b> spamd.conf(5) is now stored in /etc/mail.
Move your spamd.conf file into <tt>/etc/mail</tt> so that spamd(8) loads
the proper configuration.<br>

<p>
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=spamd&amp;sektion=8">spamd(8)</a>
and
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=spamlogd&amp;sektion=8">spamlogd(8)</a>
now support synchronisation of the greylist database across multiple
hosts.
The greytrapping mechanism now allows for whole domain traps, and
noticing out of order MX use.

<p>
spamd(8) now runs in greylist mode by default:
Whereas before greylisting had to be enabled via the <tt>-g</tt> flag,
it is now the default runtime mode.
The <tt>-b</tt> flag (which used to indicate which IP spamd(8) should
listen on) can be used to run spamd in blacklist-only mode.
The new <tt>-l</tt> flag is used to indicate which IP spamd should
listen on.

<p>
<li><b>Kernel sensors sysctl(3) MIB is now hierarchical</b><br>
The sensors sysctl(3) MIB now contains the name of the sensor device as
well as the type and index of the actual sensor.
So before when running "sysctl hw.sensors" you might've seen
"<tt>hw.sensors.12=it0, Temp 1, 25.00 degC</tt>" you will now see
"<tt>hw.sensors.it0.temp0=25.00 degC</tt>".
Update your
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sensorsd.conf&amp;sektion=5"
>sensorsd.conf(5)</a> file to reflect the new names of your sensors.

The complete list of changes made to OpenBSD 3.9 to create OpenBSD 4.0
can be found <a href="../plus40.html">here</a>, however here are a few
changes the OpenBSD team anticipate will require or warrant some special
note to people upgrading or installing OpenBSD 4.0 who are familiar with
older versions:
d378 22
a399 27
<li><b>X Window aperture support now defaults to off</b>.
Those not using X will not care, those using X will need to deliberately
turn this on.
This was due to the demonstration of security issues due to X running
as a user process with kernel-like privileges.

<li><b><a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=cdio&amp;sektion=1">cdio(1)</a>
can now do track-at-once CD creation and CDRW blanking</b>.
This means many people will no longer need to install a third-party 
recording package.

<li><b>Hostname specific install set.</b>
The install and upgrade scripts now look for an install set named
siteXY-&lt;hostname&gt;.tgz.
E.g. for 4.0 an install on a host named 'puffy' will look for
site40-puffy.tgz wherever other sets are sought.
This is intended to allow easy per host customized installations,
upgrades, or disaster recovery.

note to people upgrading or installing OpenBSD 3.9 who are familiar with

<li><b>Significant growth in the size of the installed file sets</b>
on almost all platforms.
This was done to greatly improve debugging crashes, as
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=gdb&amp;sektion=1">gdb(1)</a>
can now provide much greater information at no impact on code speed.
This may cause problems for those who partitioned their disks to the
absolute minimum, and it does significantly increase the space required
to build the system from source.

<li><b><a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ftp-proxy&amp;sektion=8">ftp-proxy(8)</a>
has been rewritten</b>, and works a bit differently than the old one,
requiring some minor modifications to your pf.conf and inetd.conf files, as
explained in more detail in the <a href="upgrade39.html">upgrade guide</a>.

<li><b>Most X third-party binary modules will no longer work.</b>
This will impact you if you are using the MGA-provided "mga_hal_drv.o"
file needed by some multi-headed configurations.
Other examples undoubtably exist.

<li><b>ipsec.conf(5) updates</b>
When <b>ike rules</b> do not include main mode parameters,
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ipsecctl&amp;sektion=8">ipsecctl(8)</a>
will now choose AES instead of 3DES for main mode encryption.
To interoperate with peers using older releases, add these values to their
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ipsec.conf&amp;sektion=5">ipsec.conf(5)</a>
files to switch to the new defaults:

If you have a network adapter using the SMC83C170 chip (such as the SMC

changed.
Before doing an upgrade, copy the <tt>/etc/hostname.tx*</tt> files to

<li><b>Improved wireless support.</b> Many current wireless network
adapters are now supported in the GENERIC kernel.

<li><b>Improvements to the OpenBSD/mac68k port</b>, now uses the 
"normal" <a href="faq4.html#bsd.rd">bsd.rd</a> installer, and runs
well on most Quadra-series systems with 68040 processor.

<li><b><a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ccd&amp;sektion=4">ccd</a>
now supports mirroring of disks.</b>
ccd(4) is in the GENERIC kernel, no custom kernel is needed.

<li><b><a href="faq6.html#CARP">CARP</a> now supports "IP-less" 
interfaces,</b> see 
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=carp&amp;sektion=4">carp(4)</a>
for details.

<li><b>OpenBGPD has been joined by
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ospfd&amp;sektion=8">ospfd(8)</a></b>,
a daemon which provides support for the Open Shortest Path First (OSPF)
protocol.

<li><b>Bash-style prompt expansions are now available in
d349 2
a350 12
meaning there are even <a href="faq10.html#ksh">fewer</a> reasons to
install "bash" on your OpenBSD system.

<li><b>X.org's X Window System has replaced XFree86.</b>
For the most part, operation will be similar.
If you have an operational XF86Config file for your system, renaming it to
xorg.conf will probably give you a fully functional X.org system.

<li><b>New loadfirmware framework</b>
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=loadfirmware&amp;sektion=9">loadfirmware(9)</a>

d341 5
a345 5
The complete list of changes made to OpenBSD 3.5 to create OpenBSD 3.6
can be found <a href="../plus36.html">here</a>, however here are some
changes the OpenBSD team anticipate will require some special note to
people upgrading or installing OpenBSD 3.6 who are familiar with older
versions:
d348 34
a381 31
<li><b>Symmetrical MultiProcessor (SMP) support is here for
i386/amd64!</b>
A separate kernel (<tt>bsd.mp</tt>) is provided for SMP operation.

<li><b>Incorporation of a Network Time Protocol daemon
(<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ntpd&amp;sektion=8">ntpd</a>)
in the base system.</b>
As one might expect, this daemon was designed to be solid, secure and
free.
It is also fairly simple to use, and is expected to satisfy the
majority of the users needing NTP services.
If you are currently using the ntpd from
<a href="faq8.html#Ports">ports</a>, you will probably wish to look at
this new program as a possible alternative.
Upgraders will need to be aware you may end up with two ntpd programs
and make sure you are running the one you desire.

<li><b>New users and groups.</b>
Several new users and groups have been added to OpenBSD due to
privilege separation.
Upgraders will have to be sure to update their <tt>/etc</tt>
directory carefully to incorporate them, as directed on
<a href="upgrade36.html">upgrade36.html</a>.

<li><b>New CD booting system.</b>
Traditionally, OpenBSD booted from CD using "floppy emulation".
This limited the install kernel size to 2.88M, and not all 
computers would boot a 2.88M emulation CDROM.
It is hoped the new "non-emulation" booting will allow the 
CD to be bootable in many newer computers that would not 
boot the earlier CDROMs.
a442 5
<li><i>Why isn't XFree86 v4.4 included?</i>
The changes to the license in v4.4 are unacceptable, and thus, along
with many other major open source software projects, OpenBSD is holding
at the last free version, which is "almost" v4.4.

people upgrading or installing OpenBSD 3.5 who are familiar with older

<li><b>i386 Platform switched to ELF with OpenBSD/i386 3.4.</b>
The 
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=elf&amp;sektion=5">ELF</a>
executable file format offers greater flexibility in memory layout
over the older
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=a.out&amp;sektion=5">a.out</a>
format, and was required for our W^X implementation on i386.
Upgrading by source is NOT an option.
Binary upgrades are possible, but very difficult, requiring uninstalling
all existing <a href="faq8.html#Packages">packages</a> before upgrade
and reinstalling them after upgrade.
There are many other potential issues here, the OpenBSD team HIGHLY
recommends you reinstall from scratch.
Note that an
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=compat_aout&amp;sektion=8">a.out
binary emulation</a> is provided by sysctl for binary-only applications
that require it.
If you are doing an upgrade, you will almost certainly need to enable
this.

<li><b>Binary Emulations are disabled by default.</b>  
This was done to make it more difficult to run a malicious program
written for another platform on OpenBSD.
This will prevent many <a href="faq8.html#Ports">ports</a> from 
working properly until the emulation is activated as needed by use of
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sysctl&amp;sektion=8">sysctl</a>s.
The standard GENERIC kernel has these options included, just disabled.  
No kernel recompile is needed.
For more information, see <a href="faq9.html#Interact">this article</a>.
If you are doing an upgrade, you will almost certainly need to enable 
<a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=compat_aout&amp;sektion=8">compat_aout</a>.

<li><b>The 8G limit for the root partition is now gone.</b>
The i386 platform now supports booting anywhere within the BIOS
supported area of the disk.
Yes, this means the 8G limit of previous versions no longer applies.
Intelligent <a href="faq4.html#SpaceNeeded">partitioning</a> is still
highly recommended.

<li><b>PXE Booting.</b>
The i386 and amd64 platforms now support <a href="faq6.html#PXE">PXE
booting</a> for install.

<li><b>New Platforms.</b>
OpenBSD has added new platforms for 3.5: 
<ul>
<li><a href="../cats.html">cats</a>, a StrongARM-based development board,
<li><a href="../amd64.html">amd64</a>, the AMD 64 bit processor, and 
<li><a href="../mvme88k.html">mvme88k</a>, systems based on the Motorola 
88000 series RISC processors.
</ul>

<li><b>sparc64 now uses GCC 3.3.2.</b>
The <a href="../sparc64.html">sparc64</a> platform has switched to GCC
3.3.2 instead of the GCC 2.95.3 used on other platforms.
Reinstallation is highly recommended over upgrading existing systems.
The new <a href="../cats.html">cats</a> and
<a href="../amd64.html">amd64</a> platforms are also using GCC 3.2.2.
Local additions like ProPolice and other improvements are, of course,
in the new GCC.

(W^X is a fine-grained memory permissions layout, ensuring that memory
which can be written to by application programs can not be executable at
the same time and vice versa.
This raises the bar on potential buffer overflows and other attacks:
as a result, an attacker is unable to write
code anywhere in memory where it can be executed.)
d363 35
a397 10
<li><b>Kerberos IV authentication has been removed.</b>
If you chose to upgrade rather than reinstall, you must remove any
references to krb4 in <tt>/etc/login.conf</tt> <i>before</i> doing
the upgrade, or you can have difficulty logging into an i386 machine in
multi-user mode.
If you have already upgraded and encountered this problem, you can 
login and fix it by following the directions
<a href="faq4.html#krb4">here</a>.
Removing the old krb4 modules from <tt>/usr/libexec/auth</tt> would also
be wise.

OpenBSD is all free. The binaries are free. The source is free. All parts of 
OpenBSD have reasonable copyright terms permitting free redistribution.
This includes the ability to REUSE most parts of the OpenBSD source tree,
either for personal or commercial purposes. OpenBSD includes NO further
restrictions other than those implied by the original BSD license.
Software which is written under stricter licenses cannot be included
in the regular distribution of OpenBSD.  This is intended to
safeguard the free use of OpenBSD.  For example, OpenBSD can be
freely used for personal use, for academic use, by government

The maintainers of OpenBSD support the project largely from their own pockets. 
This includes the time spent programming for the project, equipment used to 
support the many ports, the network resources used to distribute OpenBSD to you,
and the time spent answering questions and investigating users' bug reports. 
The OpenBSD developers are not independently wealthy and even small
contributions of time, equipment, and resources make a big difference.

New users frequently want to know whether OpenBSD is superior to some other

to the OpenBSD project. They are acknowledged by name here:

OpenBSD has a constant need for several types of support from the user 
community. If you find OpenBSD useful, you are strongly encouraged to find a 
way to contribute. If none of the suggestions below are right for you, feel 
free to propose an alternative by sending e-mail to 
a178 1

    <li><a href="../orders.html">Buy an OpenBSD CD set</a>. It includes the current full release of OpenBSD,
        and is bootable on many platforms. It also generates revenue to support
        the OpenBSD project, and reduces the strain on network resources used
        to deliver the distribution via the Internet. This inexpensive three-CD
        set includes full source. Remember, your friends need their own
        copy!
    <li><a href="../donations.html">Donate money</a>. The project has a constant need for cash to pay for
        equipment, network connectivity, and expenses relating to CD publishing.
        Manufacturing CDs requires an up-front out-of-pocket investment for the
        OpenBSD developers, without guaranteed return. Send e-mail to 
        <a href="mailto:donations@@openbsd.org">donations@@openbsd.org</a>
        to find out how to contribute. Even small donations make a profound
        difference.
    <li><a href="../want.html">Donate equipment and parts</a>. The project has a constant need for general
        and specific hardware. Items such as IDE and SCSI disks, and various
        types of RAM are always welcome. For other types of hardware such as
        computer systems and motherboards, you should inquire as to current
        need. Write to 
        <a href="mailto:donations@@openbsd.org">donations@@openbsd.org</a>
        to arrange for shipment.
    <li>Donate your time and skills. Programmers who enjoy writing operating
        systems are naturally always welcome, but there are literally dozens of
        other ways that people can be useful. Follow <a href="../mail.html">mailing</a> lists and help 
        answer new-user questions.
    <li>Help maintain documentation by submitting new FAQ material (to 
        <a href="mailto:faq@@openbsd.org">faq@@openbsd.org</a>). Form a local
        <a href="../groups.html">user group</a> and get your friends hooked on OpenBSD. Make a case to your
        employer for using OpenBSD at work. If you're a student, talk
        to your professors about using OpenBSD as a learning tool for Computer
        Science or Engineering courses. It's also worth mentioning one of the 
        most important ways you should not try to "help" The OpenBSD project:
        do not waste your time engaging in operating system flame wars. It
        does not help the project to find new users and can cause substantial
        harm to important relationships that developers have with other developers.

Change internal links from #10.XX -> #somethingmeaningfull
This will probobly break some external links to us, but will allow

restrictions other than those implied by the original BSD license, which
will allow greater applicability. Because of this, software which is
written under stricter licenses cannot be included in the regular

The maintainers of OpenBSD support the project largely from their own pockets. This includes the time spent programming for
the project, equipment used to support the many ports, the network resources used to distribute OpenBSD to you, and the
time spent answering questions and investigating users' bug reports. The OpenBSD developers are not independently wealthy
and even small contributions of time, equipment, and resources make a big difference.

Below are some reasons why we think OpenBSD is a useful operating system. Whether OpenBSD is right for you is a question
that only you can answer. <br>
d126 14
a139 8
<li>OpenBSD runs on many different hardware platforms. 
<li>OpenBSD is thought by many security professionals to be the most secure UNIX-like operating system as the result of a
     10-member 1.5-year long comprehensive source code security audit. 
<li>OpenBSD is a full-featured UNIX-like operating system available in source form at no charge. 
<li>OpenBSD integrates cutting-edge security technology suitable for building firewalls and private network services in a
     distributed environment. 
<li>OpenBSD benefits from strong on-going development in many areas, offering opportunities to work with emerging
     technologies with an international community of programmers and end-users. <li>OpenBSD offers opportunities for ordinary people to participate in the development and testing of the product.

We are greatly indebted to the people and organizations that have contributed to the OpenBSD project. They are
acknowledged by name here:<br>
<a href="../donations.html">www.openbsd.org/donations.html</a>
<p>
OpenBSD has a constant need for several types of support from the user community. If you find OpenBSD useful, you are
strongly encouraged to find a way to contribute. If none of the suggestions below are right for you, feel free to propose an
alternative by sending e-mail to <a href="mailto:donations@@openbsd.org">donations@@openbsd.org.</a> 
d169 37
a205 20
<li>Buy an OpenBSD CD. It includes the current full release of OpenBSD,
and is bootable on many platforms. It also generates
     revenue to support the OpenBSD project, and reduces the strain on network resources used to deliver the distribution
     via the Internet. This inexpensive two-CD set includes full source. Remember, your friends need their own copy! 
<li>Donate money. The project has a constant need for cash to pay for equipment, network connectivity, and expenses
     relating to CD publishing. Manufacturing CDs requires an up-front out-of-pocket investment for the OpenBSD
     developers, without guaranteed return. Send e-mail to <a href="mailto:donations@@openbsd.org">donations@@openbsd.org</a> to find out how to contribute. Even small
     donations make a profound difference. 
<li>Donate equipment and parts. The project has a constant need for general and specific hardware. Items such as IDE and
     SCSI disks, and various types of RAM are always welcome. For other types of hardware such as computer systems
     and motherboards, you should inquire as to current need. Write to <a href="mailto:donations@@openbsd.org">donations@@openbsd.org</a> to arrange for shipment. 
<li>Donate your time and skills. Programmers who enjoy writing operating systems are naturally always welcome, but there
     are literally dozens of other ways that people can be useful. Follow mailing lists and help answer new-user questions. 
<li>Help maintain documentation by submitting new FAQ material (to <a href="mailto:faq@@openbsd.org">faq@@openbsd.org</a>). Form a local user group and get
     your friends hooked on OpenBSD. Make a case to your employer for using OpenBSD at work. If you're a student, talk
     to your professors about using OpenBSD as a learning tool for Computer Science or Engineering courses. It's also
     worth mentioning one of the most important ways you should not try to "help" The OpenBSD project: do not waste your
     time engaging in operating system flame wars on Usenet newsgroups. it does nothing to help project find new users and
     can cause substantial harm important relationships that developers have with other developers. team uses learns from
     respects many different systems presume dictate what others should use
