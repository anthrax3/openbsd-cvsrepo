<TITLE>OpenBSD New User FAQ: Virtual Consoles</TITLE>

<H2><A NAME="s2">2. Virtual Consoles</A></H2>

<P>To start, virtual consoles are only supported on the i386
port. The default <EM>GENERIC</EM> kernel (the one you normally
get after doing an install) has support for virtual consoles
compiled in. If you are using an older <EM>GENERIC</EM> kernel,
or a different kernel, support for "vt0" (the kernel device
that controls virtual consoles) may not be included. If you
are using the 2.1 release <EM>GENERIC</EM> kernel, you will have
virtual consoles enabled.</P>

<P>On the 2.1 CD and FTP sites, the <EM>GENERIC</EM> kernel does not
use virtual consoles. You must recompile the kernel commenting
out the line that says "<CODE>pc0</CODE>" and uncommenting the line
that says "<CODE>vt0</CODE>." For more information on compiling a new
kernel, read on.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss2.1">2.1 Now that I have virtual consoles, how do I use them?</A></H2>

<P>Unlike Linux, you need to hit <CODE>cntrl+alt+fn</CODE> to swap from
console to console. By default (with the files in <CODE>/dev/</CODE>
from your install, and a newly compiled kernel with vt0 support)
you have four (<EM>F1</EM> through <EM>F4</EM>) virtual consoles. If
you make more <CODE>ttyC</CODE> devices in <CODE>/dev</CODE> (done via:
"<CODE>cd /dev; MAKEDEV ttyC4; MAKEDEV ttyC5;  MAKEDEV ttyC6;
MAKEDEV ttyC7;</CODE>) and edit <CODE>/etc/ttys</CODE> so that all the
tty's are on, you will have a standard eight virtual consoles.</P>

@Hey, it's the FAQ, all setup for the OpenBSD website! I need to add a link
from the main page here and an index.html to the "faq" directory.
