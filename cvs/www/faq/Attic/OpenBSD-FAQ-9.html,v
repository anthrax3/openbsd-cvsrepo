Arc, Mac (68k), Pmax, and Motorola 68k VME systems, source
code, X11R6.3, XFree86 3.3 (binaries and sources). In addition,
The CDs are designed to be bootable on multiple architectures.</P>

<P>This URL <CODE>
<A HREF="http://www.OpenBSD.ORG/orders.html">http://www.OpenBSD.ORG/orders.html</A></CODE> will take
you through the credit card on-line odering system. To order
VIA phone, call +1 (403) 605-8166 between 8AM and 5PM North
American Mountain Standard Time. Please have your American
Express, Master Card or Visa ready.</P>

from the main page here and an index.html to the "faq" directory.
