<P>The OpenBSD source tree is always evolving. The 2.1 release
is wonderful and stable; however since the release snapshots
will be made with many bugfixes every so often.  Make sure
you are running the latest code before giving up. See the
OpenBSD ftp mirrors (as listed on the OpenBSD www sites) as
well as the 
<A HREF="OpenBSD-FAQ-4.html#cvs-sec">CVS section</A> on how to
obtain the source.  ALSO, watch the <CODE>misc@@OpenBSD.ORG</CODE>
and <CODE>announce@@OpenBSD.ORG</CODE> mailing lists for vital
information. As another resource with your problems, check the
OpenBSD mailing list archive, where it is quite possible that
your question or concern has already been addressed.</P>

<P>PS: always "<CODE>man (utility)</CODE>" and "<CODE>apropos
(problem)</CODE>" because the answer you are looking for can lurk
in the documentation.</P>

@Hey, it's the FAQ, all setup for the OpenBSD website! I need to add a link
from the main page here and an index.html to the "faq" directory.
