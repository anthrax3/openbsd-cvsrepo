Project Goals


Integration of good code with acceptable licenses
Berkeley style preferred
GPL (and similar) acceptable
NDA not OK

Attention to security
Continually audit tree for new types of bugs/holes
Today's innocent bug is tomorrow's hole
Robust code == safe software
use safe variants of libc functions
convert old code to new interfaces
care is required
