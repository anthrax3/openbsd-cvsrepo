<hr>
<p>
<a name="#unsup"><h3><font color=#0000e0>Unsupported Hardware:</font></h3></a>
<ul>
<li>
Support for older PREP style machines has been removed; lack of
availability of the hardware and relatively slow speed compared to more
recent machines has contributed to this decision.
<li>
Apple PowerMac systems with a 601 processor or lack OpenFirmware
will likely never be supported. 
<li> 
At the current time, older OpenFirmware machines are not supported.
This is mostly due to lack of developer resources to work on the support
in addition to limited availability of hardware.
<li>On the device side, the following are recognized, but not supported:
<ul>
<li>Texas Instruments TSB12LV23 FireWire
</ul>
</ul>

<h3><font color="#0000e0">Shared HFS disks:</font></h3>
<p>
It is possible to share a disk between MacOS (OS X?) and OpenBSD.
MacOS must be installed first, and an Unused partition or other free
partition can then be used to install OpenBSD.
If a shared disk is to be used and be bootable, the bootloader "ofwboot"
must be copied onto the first HFS partition.
It is unknown if Openfirmware can load the OpenBSD bootloader from the
MacOS X FFS partition.
See INSTALL.powerpc for more details on how to install a shared disk.

<h3><font color="#0000e0">Root Drive:</font></h3>
<p>
With multiple drives installed in the system, only certain drives can
be configured as an OpenBSD root drive.  Any other configurations than
those below will not be able to properly detect which drive is the root
drive, and so any attempt with either prompt for a root drive, or fail.
<p>
<ul>
<li><tt>ultra0</tt> is always fine to use as an root drive.
<li><tt>ultra1</tt> is fine to use as a root disk (as long as <tt>ultra0</tt> 
is a hard drive, not ATAPI).
<li>If no hard drive is located at <tt>ultra1</tt>, it is possible to use a 
hard drive configured as <tt>ide1</tt> (zip bay) as root drive. 
<li>It is not possible to use <tt>ide0</tt> (CD-ROM) as a root drive unless 
no drives are connected to the Ultra IDE bus.
</ul>

<h3><font color="#0000e0">X Resolution:</font></h3>
<p>
The current X server has no mechanism to change the resolution
of the display. To change the resolution, it is necessary to boot MacOS
and change to the desired resolution under MacOS. It will save that
resolution and OpenFirmware will boot in that resolution until connected
to a different monitor. The X server will run in whatever resolution
OpenFirmware boots in.

<p>If you are looking for to test new pre-release features, you can 
try one of the snapshots. 
For the powerpc architecture, <a href="ftp://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/snapshots/powerpc">snapshots</a> are made available from time to time.

<h3><font color="#0000e0">History:</font></h3>
d23 2
a24 45
The powerpc port was first imported into OpenBSD at the end of 1996.
Portions of the kernel came from the NetBSD/macppc port, and the
userland and build pieces came from
<a href="mailto:drahn@@openbsd.org">Dale Rahn</a>.

<p>
Dale added ELF binary support, and then work with Per Fogelstrom
continued on general driver support for the next few releases.
Support was added for OpenFirmware, VI Power4e boards, MCG Powerstack
machines, DEC 21040, VGA terminal support, and so on.

<p>
In 1998, the focus shifted towards the Apple machines, and Dale Rahn
started work to make the range of iMacs and PowerMacs work with this port.
Due to this, official powerpc releases were not made for the 2.6 and 2.7
releases as work continued.  A number of compiler loader issues were resolved,
iMac driver support was added, and compatibility with older systems
was withdrawn to fully concentrate on the Apple machines.  

<p>
OpenBSD/powerpc 2.8 supported Apple hardware.

<p>
For 2.9, powerpc has moved to UVM, this change has fixed the
corrupted shared library "pmap" bug that was rather pervasive for 2.8.

<p>

<h3><font color="#0000e0">Known Problems</font></h3>
The adb keyboard driver, on the iBook and Titanium Powerbook G4,
has problems such that some keystrokes can cause crashes. This
problem is mostly constrained to multiple keypresses involving the
<code>Fn</code> key. Also note that &lt;CTRL>&lt;CMD>&lt;POWER> will
reset the machine.
<p>
USB Hot-Plug detection problems exist on many of the newer systems.
This problem only exists with the root hub on systems which have only
one port per root hub, G4 tower systems, PowerBook G4, newer iMacs.
These systems configure with both ohci0 and ohci1.

<h3><font color="#0000e0">History:</font></h3>

<p>
The powerpc port was first imported into OpenBSD at the end of 1996.
Portions of the kernel came from the NetBSD/macppc port, and the
userland and build pieces came from
<a href="mailto:drahn@@openbsd.org">Dale Rahn</a>.

<p>
Dale added ELF binary support, and then work with Per Fogelstrom
continued on general driver support for the next few releases.
Support was added for OpenFirmware, VI Power4e boards, MCG Powerstack
machines, DEC 21040, VGA terminal support, and so on.

<p>
In 1998, the focus shifted towards the Apple machines, and Dale Rahn
started work to make the range of iMacs and PowerMacs work with this port.
Due to this, official powerpc releases were not made for the 2.6 and 2.7
releases as work continued.  A number of compiler loader issues were resolved,
iMac driver support was added, and compatibility with older systems
was withdrawn to fully concentrate on the Apple machines.  

<p>
OpenBSD/powerpc 2.8 supported Apple hardware.

<p>
In 2.8 -current powerpc has moved to UVM, this change has fixed the corrupted
shared library "pmap" bug that was rather pervasive.

<h3><strong>Status:</strong></h3>
d30 4
a33 6
This is a rather new port.  It supports some types of machines with
PowerPC processors in them -- <strong>but not all</strong>.  Even though
there are standards committees trying to resolve the problem, there are
significant differences between various PowerPC computers, even when made
by the same vendor!  This port will run on some machines, but not on others.
Check the list below.
d36 6
a41 1
To work, a machine MUST have some variety of OpenBoot firmware!
d44 2
a45 6
The processor support is quite stable at this point.
Driver support is currently somewhat limited, due to most PCI devices
only having been tested on little-endian machines. Additional device
support for Macintosh hardware systems is under development any
programming information for any recent Mac hardware would improve
this situation.
d47 1
d49 5
a53 1
The following processors are supported: 603, 603e, 604, 604ev, 750.
d56 6
a61 4
The port does not yet use real device drivers. It uses OpenFirmware
for all device driver needs: console, disk, ethernet. It can be
installed from netboot, floppy and network or cdrom.  Netroot
support exists, but is untested.
d63 6
a68 4
The port has two versions of the kernel, one which only uses openfirmware
for all devices, and a version that has been coded to support some MCG
PowerStack and VI series machines.

<h3><strong>History:</strong></h3>
d184 4
a187 31
<p>
The powerpc specific portions of the kernel came from the NetBSD port
by Wolfgang Solfrank. The userland and build tools came from an
independent and incomplete port by Dale Rahn. Hopefully pieces
from that other port will be merged, device driver support for
interrupts and some real driver support.
The conversion to the Wolfgang port was done because it was running
multiuser and the other port was still single user out of memory ramdisk
(no fully working device drivers).
<p>
After that work was done Per Fogelstrom added support for the VI Power4e 
vme board, removing openfirmware device support in the processes. (2.3 release)
<p>
For the 2.4 release, support for the openfirmware devices were added back
in a compatible fashion such that mixed ofw drivers and hardware drivers
could be supported. After that was finished, the power4e support was adapted
to work on the MCG PowerStack machines. Dec 21040, and some vga support was
added, vga cannot be used as console yet, but can be used as a terminal.
No X servers are supported, but the mechanism to access vga via mmap exists.
<p>
For 2.5 support continued at the previous level as 2.4.
<p>
For 2.6 support an offical release was not made for the powerpc port.
Work on the iMac had started and compiler loader issues had not been
resolved which prevented the system from building out of the tree.
<p>
Post 2.6, iMac support has been added, further development is underway
to support the imac devices better and add support for other systems.
Initally with the imac driver support, compatibility with older
systems was lost. This is primarily due to a lack of testing, these
systems will be supported once the system changes are backported.

As such, this is still rather preliminary and should not be considered
finished. 
The port is still not fully stable, but is now running well enough that
is is reasonable to do system development.
Hopefully, all stablity problem will be worked on and this will
become a reasonably useable port.
However, if you have PowerPC hardware we would like to know
