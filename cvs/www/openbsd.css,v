@Raise max-width. Still pixel-based as %-based steals too many pixels on
small screens.

Does anyone have suggestions on how to set e.g. 80% max-width while
protecting against small windows going too narrow without forcing
scrolling on mobile devices?

@Drop font-size setting, it's not far off browser defaults anyway, blows up
the tt/pre text size a bit too much making things look unbalanced (discussed
with tb@@ tj@@), and forcing it here isn't so good for people who override
defaults (deraadt@@ didn't like this).  ok tb@@
