<h2>Open source software: Ready for Credit Union Primetime?</h2>

Unless you have been living in the dark reaches of
Antarctica, it's been hard for you to escape the
news; the open source movement is here.
<p>
With the movement comes all of the questions that
Credit Union IS Managers have to ask themselves, such
as "What is open source software?" "What can it do
for me in the enterprise?" and "Should I use open
source?". I'd like to try to answer these questions.
<p>
To answer the question of what is open source
software, you need look no further than the
OpenBSD
website. OpenBSD is an operating system
maintained by
Theo de Raadt and numerous other developers who
strive to make a proactively secure operating
system.
<p>
The source code is open, hence the name (open source)
which allows any user to modify the operating system
to increase functionality, fix flaws or port the
operating system to other platforms (OpenBSD will
presently operate on Intel, Sparc, Alpha, Amiga,
HP300 and MAC68k). Additionally, because of the
openness of the source code, users can write their
own programs, build firewalls and routers and do many
things that you wouldn't normally be able to do with
commercial proprietary packages.
<p>
What can open source do for you in the enterprise?
What do you need done? One of the strongest
attractions to open source software, besides the fact
that it is most often free, is the versatility that
it allows you to draw on to meet your needs.  Along
with those uses mentioned in the paragraph
above, you can do some or all of the following:

<ul>
<li>Print servers
<li>Proxy servers
<li>Web servers
<li>Discussion group servers
<li>Mail servers
<li>Workstations
<li>DNS Servers
<li>Modem servers
</ul>

As you can see, the options are almost endless, and
as the open source movement grows, the functionality
is sure to increase. Additionally, open source
software will often run on machines that are no
longer robust enough to run the latest commercial
software. Remember those old 486's you were going to
toss? Don't do it just yet.
<p>
This leads us to the final question, should you use
open source? Now some would say that this question is
as personal as what color of shoes you wear in the
morning. However, I think it's more in line with
determining what your corporate needs are, and then
identifying if you have the expertise in-house to
work with the software. As an example, say you have a
need for a print server for a secretary workgroup,
you could:
<p>
<blockquote>
A) Purchase a commercial proprietary package to utilize<br>
B) Purchase a printer with a built in network card and print server<br>
C) Utilize an old 486 with 8 Meg of ram and open source software<br>
</blockquote>
<p>
Now, should you choose option "C", you'll need to
take a hard look at yourself and your staff. Open
source software is almost always based on some type
of Unix variant, usually does not come standard with
a GUI ready for use and can use some fairly arcane
commands just to install. As a result, the learning
curve is considerably steeper than with some
commercially available packages. If you don't have
the expertise in house to work with the software, the
fact that you didn't spend any money is far
overshadowed by the amount of time and effort it took
just to get the product up and running. As well, you
need to give thought to other implications brought
about by improperly configured machines (system
downtime, security, etc.). However, should you have
the expertise or the time to learn, there is a
definite cost savings that can be associated with
using older machinery and open source software.
<p>
As you can see, open source software isn't for
everyone out of the chute. As time passes though, I'm
sure that we'll all see a far greater number of users
and better standardization by the companies and
organizations that maintain the software.
<p>
If you would like to learn more about open source
software and its possible uses in your enterprise, I
would recommend the following web links as good
places to start:

@Clean up meta tags.

name=distribution, name=keywords, and name=resource-type have no effect
in modern search engines and just clutter up the page source.
