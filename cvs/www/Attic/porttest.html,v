    <h2><a name="Introduction"><font color=
    "#0000e0">Introduction</font></a></h2>

    <p>The <a href="faq/faq15.html#Ports">ports tree</a> is a huge piece
    of work that
    permits OpenBSD users to use third-party programs without wasting time 
    patching, configuring and installing each one individually. This work 
    is done by a group of volunteers who spend their time porting and testing
    applications across the range of OpenBSD platforms. Many people think 
    that they cannot help this process because they do not have enough 
    knowledge; this is false because they can help porters work better and 
    faster.</p>

    <h2><a name="How"><font color="#0000e0">How</font></a></h2>

    <p>Testing submitted updates or new ports which are posted on the
    <a href="mail.html">ports mailing list</a>. By doing this
    you reduce the latency of commits and also increase the number of ports to
    be committed (many ports are not committed because of lack of testing!).</p>

    <h2><a name="First"><font color="#0000e0">First step</font></a></h2>

    <p>The ports tree is developed against 
    <a href="plus.html">OpenBSD-current</a>; there is no guarantee that 
    new ports or updates will work correctly on the other branches.
    This means 
    you should upgrade your system and ports tree to -current 
    (instructions on how to do this can be found at the 
    <a href="anoncvs.html">anoncvs</a> and 
    <a href="faq/current.html">Following Current</a>) pages.
    It is also recommended that you subscribe to the ports and ports-changes
    <a href="mail.html">mailing-lists</a>. This way you will be notified
    about new or updated ports and about changes in the ports tree.</p>
    
    <h2><a name="Testing"><font color="#0000e0">Testing</font></a></h2>

    <p>There are two types of submissions on the mailing-lists; new ports
    and updates. New ports are generally posted as tarball attachments
    or URLs. A good idea is to extract them into the 
    <tt>/usr/ports/mystuff/</tt> directory and test from there.
    Updates are generally a diff against the -current ports tree, so it is best 
    to copy the port to <tt>mystuff/</tt> and apply the diff to prevent tree
    breakage.</p>

    <p>Step-by-step building is needed to verify that every target, see 
    <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ports&amp;sektion=7&amp;">
    ports(7)</a>, is achieved correctly :</p>

    <ul>
      <li><i>fetch</i>
        <ul>
         <li>Needed to verify that distfile(s) are correctly downloaded. Try
         to test all of the <tt>MASTER_SITES</tt> specified to make sure they
         are all valid sources.</li>
        </ul>

      <li><i>checksum</i>
        <ul>
         <li>Verify that downloaded distfiles match the checksums recorded
         in the <tt>distinfo</tt> file.</li>
        </ul>

      <li><i>extract</i>
        <ul><li>Each of the distfiles should install any dependent programs
        (such as bzip2) beforehand.</li></ul>

      <li><i>patch</i>
        <ul>
         <li>Patches should apply cleanly without any warnings.
         <li>There shouldn't be any <tt>.orig</tt> files left behind in the
             <tt>patches/</tt> directory.
         <li>Another common mistake is to include RCS tags in a patch; this
         will break when the port is checked into the repository and the RCS
         tag expanded.
        </ul>

      <li><i>configure</i>
        <ul>
         <li>Check that configure scripts correctly detect features
             on your platform.
         <li>GNU libtool is notorious for undesired 'features' on OpenBSD,
             so check that the port is using a recent version which creates
             correct libraries on your architecture.
         <li>The configure script should not detect stray applications already
             installed on your system without explicit dependencies being
             set in the port.
        </ul>

      <li><i>build</i>
        <ul>
         <li>Check for build errors and suspicious warnings.
         <li>Warnings about <a href=
      "http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=tmpnam&amp;sektion=3&amp;">
      tmpnam(3)</a> issues should be resolved by using
      <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=mkstemp&amp;sektion=3&amp;">
          mkstemp(3)</a>.</li>
         <li>Try to set the <tt>SEPARATE_BUILD</tt> variable to 'concurrent'
         and test if the build still works.
         <li>Make sure dependencies on GNU make are really necessary.
         <li>Check whether the port is using libtool. If it is, try
         setting <tt>USE_LIBTOOL=Yes</tt>. This way, the ports
         infrastructure will use the libtool version in the tree, instead
         of libtool versions that come bundled with the software's source.
        </ul>

      <li><i>regress</i>
        <ul>
          <li>Check for errors (empty tests means okay).
        </ul>


      <li><i>fake</i>
        <ul>
         <li>This target installs the application into a fake working
         directory, to ensure that all files can be easily packaged up
         without affecting the base system.
         <li>The port should <b>never</b> install files outside of the
         fake directory (such as into <tt>/usr/local</tt>).
         This kind of mistake can be easily caught by using
         <tt>USE_SYSTRACE=Yes</tt>.
         <li>GNU libtool occasionally has trouble relinking libraries
         during the fake process on some architectures.
         <li>Check whether all files get installed with correct ownerships
         and permissions.
        </ul>

      <li><i>package</i>
        <ul>
         <li>Package creation can break if pkg/PLIST* and/or
         pkg/PFRAG* are wrong.</li>
        </ul>

      <li><i>lib-depends-check</i>
        <ul>
         <li>This will check whether all libraries on which the port depends
         can be reached through either <tt>LIB_DEPENDS</tt> or <tt>WANTLIB</tt>.
         The result should be empty. The above variables should be inspected
         when you see lines starting "Extra" or "Missing".
        </ul>

      <li><i>install</i>
        <ul>
         <li>Packages should install all of the files from their packaging
         lists successfully and with the correct permissions.  Be especially
         careful of files with the setuid bits set.
         <li>Make sure that the package <tt>INSTALL</tt> script works
         correctly, and does not overwrite any files in <tt>/etc</tt>.
        </ul>

      <li><i>deinstall</i>
        <ul>
         <li>This should remove all files installed by the package, except
         those in <tt>/etc</tt>.
         <li>Make sure that the <tt>DEINSTALL</tt> script works as expected.
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <p>Remaining <tt>pkg/</tt> files like DESCR and MESSAGE should be checked
    for grammar and typos.  Paragraphs should be formatted using
    <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=fmt&amp;sektion=1&amp;format=html">fmt(1)</a> and wrapped at 70 characters.</p>

    <h2><a name="Commenting"><font color="#0000e0">Commenting</font></a></h2>

    <p>At the end of the test comes the really important thing : comments.
    Even if the port is working fine comments must be done. If we have ten
    posts where people say that the port runs fine under different architectures
    then the commit is done faster. If it does not work then some information
    must be given.
    There are tools that can help in this task, like <a href=
    "http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/ports/infrastructure/bin/portslogger">
    portslogger</a> which is like an "intelligent tee" that redirects output
    into a log file.</p>

    <p>Example :<br>
    </p>

    <div style="margin-left: 2em">
      <table border="0" cellpadding="3" width="90%">
        <tr>
          <td nowrap bgcolor="#EEEEEE">
<pre>
    # make install 2&gt;&amp;1 | /usr/ports/infrastructure/bin/portslogger .
</pre>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </div>
    <br>
     <br>

    <p>This will redirect the output into a log file located in the current
    directory.</p>

    <p>Finally, once the port is found to be okay, other ports depending on
    it should also be tested, to check whether they are still working
    correctly. The <i>show-required-by</i> make target will help to find
    other ports which depend on the current one.

    <h2><a name="More"><font color="#0000e0">More testing</font></a></h2>

    <p>Check the port's Makefile for correct dependencies, typos, incorrect
    links, useless or missing variables, correct licensing and categories.
    Those who are more skilled can help by examining patches, as well as
    providing diffs to correct bugs, add flavors, or other enhancements.</p>
    <p>These diffs should be done with the <tt>-uNr --exclude=CVS</tt> options.
    <tt>cvs diff -uN</tt> can also be used to generate patches against
    the CVS repository.</p>

    permits OpenBSD users to use third-party programs without losing time in
    patching, configuring, etc. This work is done by a few volunteers who
    spend hours making your favorite applications work fine on your
    system. Many people think that they can't help our project because they
    don't have enough knowledge; this is false because they can help porters
    work better and faster.</p>

    <p>Simply by testing submitted updates or new ports which are posted on
d54 10
a63 12
    <p>Before starting the tester must have in mind that ports development is
    done with <a href="plus.html">OpenBSD-current</a> as target.This means
    that there is no guarantee that new ports will work correctly on the other
    branches. This also means that the tester should upgrade his system to
    -current as well as the ports tree (instructions on how to do this can be
    found at the <a href="../anoncvs.html">anoncvs</a> page and in the
    proper <a href="./upgrade-minifaq.html">faq section</a>.
    Having this done, the system is now prepared to do port testing. It is also
    advisable the subscription of ports and ports-changes
    <a href="../mail.html">mailing-lists</a>, this way the tester will be notified
    about new/updated ports (to be tested) and about changes in the ports
    tree.</p>
d67 6
a72 6
    <p>In the mailing-lists two types of submission can be found; new ports
    and updates. New ports are generally posted as tarball attachment
    (or an url is given) which contains the port tree. A good idea is to extract
    it into the <tt>/usr/ports/mystuff/</tt> directory and test the port from here.
    Updates are generally a diff against current ports tree, so it is suggested
    to copy the port in <tt>mystuff/</tt> and apply the diff to prevent tree

      <li>fetch : Needed to verify that distfile(s) are correctly downloaded.</li>

      <li>extract : Generally extract is done without a problem, this target can
      be ignored in most cases.</li>

      <li>patch : Check if patches are applied correctly and track down
      forgotten <tt>.orig</tt> files.</li>

      <li>configure : For ports which use a configure script the tester can
      verify if it has the correct path for dependencies, use(less) features,
      etc ...</li>

      <li>build : The build itself should not give errors but could contain
      minor warnings about <a href=

      tmpnam(3)</a> issues to be resolved by using
      <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=mkstemp&amp;sektion=3&amp;">
      mkstemp(3)</a>.</li>

      <li>fake : This target fakes installation of the package and prepares
      its installation. Checking can be done by verifying that files are
      properly installed in the fake directory.</li>

      <li>package : Package creation can break if pkg/PLIST* and/or
      pkg/PFRAG* are wrong.</li>

      <li>install : Check that package installation works fine.</li>

      <li>deinstall : Don't forget to test deinstall.</li>

    <p>Before starting you must know that ports development is done by
    following <a href="plus.html">OpenBSD-current</a>; you can find
    instructions on following current <a href="anoncvs.html">source</a> and
    <a href="faq/upgrade-minifaq.html">upgrade faq</a>. When it's done you
    are ready to follow <a href=

    <p>You will need to perform step-by-step the building of the port to

    <p>You could also check some pkg/ stuff like DESCR, MESSAGE, INSTALL,

    Even if the port is working fine you must comment on it.  If we have ten

    then the commit is done faster. If it does not work then you must give some
    information using tools such as <a href=

    <p>For those who are more skilled they can test targets like
    lib-depends-check, look at patches and pkg stuff. You can also provide
    diffs to correct bugs, add flavors, or other enhancements.</p>
