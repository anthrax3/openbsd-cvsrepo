  <p>This page lists the date and last change for each OpenBSD port
     by category.  The ports team tries to verify that each port works
     as expected, but given the number of machines and machine
     configurations supported there can be no guarantee that any given
     port will work on your system.  If you find a port that does not
     work please let us know by mailing to
     <a href="mailto:ports@@openbsd.org">ports@@OpenBSD.ORG</a>.  Be
     sure to include:
     <ul>
      <li>the port name and version
      <li>your OpenBSD version, including any patches you may have applied.
      <li>the output of <kbd>uname -a</kbd>.
      <li>a complete description of the problem.

@update copyright date in the header that makes the port status page
re-build the port status page.   It had not been updated in quite a
long while.   It is not perfect as the script that builds the page
from portstat.stat doesn't know about the new third level directories.
I processed the cvs change logs to extract the update comments.
It's a reasonable starting place for future changes
