@spotted by jasper.  also delete this file, as noted when doing the other purges:

the project has in the past received a small pittance of money for sales
referrals to amazon, but it is wrong to accept this bribe money from such
people.  instead, we will let people who want these books make their own
decisions as to where to purchase books.

@body tags w/ explicit background color must also have an explicit foreground
color, else some browsers will do white on white or other funny stuff.

inspired by a diff from Ray Lai on www@@
