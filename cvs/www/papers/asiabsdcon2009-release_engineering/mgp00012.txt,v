But things go wrong too often


Unbearably painful

Late releases, and very late release

Buggy releases

Frustrated users ("bugs are normal")

Frustrated developers

Develop -> ship less-than-perfect release -> maintain forever

.1 releases (.11, anyone?)

Focus on post-release maintainance rather than release itself
