Release "engineering"


Engineering

"The creative application of scientific principles to
design or develop structures, machines, apparatus, or
manufacturing processes, or works utilizing them singly
or in combination; or to construct or operate the same
with full cognizance of their design; or to forecast their
behavior under specific operating conditions; all as
respects an intended function, economics of operation and
safety to life and property."

By this definition, most projects have no "engineering" in
their release "engineering" ... only replaying techiques others
have used before
