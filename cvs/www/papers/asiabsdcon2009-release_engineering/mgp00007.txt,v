Trying not to ruffle feathers


Companies can afford (time, people, money) seperate development
and testing teams ...

Open Source projects cannot... but many still try to do
release engineering that way

OpenSolaris (one development team, two release teams)

Linux, for instance, Debian (often very late)

FreeBSD (more focus on merge-back than on newer releases)

non-OS projects...

X11 ...
