OpenBSD evolution viewed by Average Joe

Easy updating of packages: pkg_add -r -u -i

Don't tell anyone I said this, but using Java on OpenBSD is actually fun these days	

OpenBSD has evolved to a secure general-purpose OS that comes with full-blown support for a lot of ISP scenarios as well

There is no WPA/WPA2 yet :(
