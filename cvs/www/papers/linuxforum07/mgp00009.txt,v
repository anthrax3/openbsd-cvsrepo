OpenBSD hackathons

e-mail and icb is good, but face to face is so much better

One big hackathon once per year in Calgary

In the last two years the idea of mini-hackathons got popular

k2k6 - crypto hackathon that took place in Kransberg, Germany
r2k6 - routing hackathon that happened in Hamburg, Germany,
h2k6 - hardware hackathon in Coimbra, Portugal
p2k6 - port hackathon in Hungary

hackathons are a good places to finish some idea and show it around to the other developers
