Big new things - IPSec revisited

IPSec has been improved a lot!

Easily setup in minutes

We now have ipsecctl(8), supersedes ipsecadm(8)

Configuration file for ipsecctl has the same style as others in OpenBSD (pf.conf)

Thanks to an improved sasyncd(8) fail-over scenarios for IPSec are much more robust
