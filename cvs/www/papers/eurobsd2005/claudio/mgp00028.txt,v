Thanks

Esben Norby <norby@@openbsd.org>, who started with the OpenOSPFD project and implemented large parts of it.

Andre Oppermann <oppermann@@networx.ch> and Internet Business Solutions AG for "sponsoring" my work on OpenOSPFD.

Henning Brauer <henning@@openbsd.org> and the rest of the OpenBSD gang for a lot of code to steal from.
