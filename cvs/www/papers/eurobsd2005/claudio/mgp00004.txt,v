Introduction - Routing Algorithms

Distance Vector Algorithms
exchange of routing tables between neighbors
compare tables and choose best routes
redistribute again
Features
easy to implement
ability to express routing policies
Problems
slow propagation of changes
count to infinity
Path distance vector algorithm does not suffer from this problem
Examples
RIP, BGP (path distance vector)
