Usage - Carp and ospfd

carp - Common Address Redundancy Protocol
ospfd - routing daemon using network redundancy for re-routing
      conflicts!
      ... but very powerful if used correctly
Impossible to run OSPF on a carp interface
Instead use carp to connect a LAN with servers to an OSPF cloud
more than one ospf router
default gateway on servers is carped and does not change
Use a "passive" carp interface and multiple ethernet interfaces to connect router to the OSPF cloud; link-state of carp interface is tracked
route in the OSPF cloud will always point to the active carp interface
