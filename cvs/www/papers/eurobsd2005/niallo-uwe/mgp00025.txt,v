What was done - locore


Equipped with our boot loader and a reliable indicator - THE GREEN LED - we quickly debugged our way through the assembly code

zaurus_start.S
resets the MMU and maps virtual memory 1:1 to physical
jumps to start() in locore.S

locore.S is already shared between arm platforms
clears .bss and sets up a small initial C program stack
calls the C language function initarm()
thereafter jumps to main()

So then we moved our attention and the GREEN LED forward into initarm()...
