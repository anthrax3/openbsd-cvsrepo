Lessons learned


The positive side of using Linux as a first stage boot loader is that it greatly simplified the implementation of our second stage boot loader, since we already had high-level system calls to deal with disk and console I/O

A convenient boot loader is needed to get up to speed with development

Symbol table loading (ksyms) is important
to make the kernel debugger - DDB - useful
to get useful backtraces from panics, and thus useful bug reports
