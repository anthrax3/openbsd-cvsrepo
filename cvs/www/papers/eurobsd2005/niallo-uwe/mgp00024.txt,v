What was done - boot loader


So we wrote a better boot loader that

does not depend on Linux headers
can be compiled natively on cats
loads a kernel image from userland
thus needs to be compiled only once

Then on top of it we implemented OpenBSD's standard interactive boot loader boot(8) that

requires only a few syscall stubs to run on Linux
loads the kernel directly from a BSD FFS partition
