What was done - drivers


New zkbd(4) driver quickly hacked up to support the built-in keyboard

firrst vversionnnn had issueesss, worse than today :-)

difficult to handle efficiently, because there are no separate interrupts for each key press/release

really is a damned "mesh of wires" - about 22 different GPIO input signals for about 75 keys

New keyboard type introduced in the console keyboard driver wskbd(4) for this very unique keyboard layout
