Which platforms are interesting


Fast machines available to build packages and snaps
multi-processor systems, or new GHz ARM CPUs

Some developers would prefer a slow machine
if only because it "warms the place very well"
but fast machines still benefit from their work

Discontinued hardware platforms can still be interesting, as long as replacement parts are available
