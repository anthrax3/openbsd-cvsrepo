Zaurus-specific porting considerations


Startup:




Proprietary firmware code loads the Linux kernel from a fixed address in NAND flash
to access this, have to have NAND flash writing code
its dangerous to play around flashing with the ROM (easy to brick the Zaurus)
thus we must run our boot loader from Linux

But we can still make it easy to set up and run OpenBSD with an installable package for Linux


No nice boot firmware to let us load an ELF
binary directly
