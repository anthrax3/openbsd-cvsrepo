Reasons for supporting many platforms


Portability is increased

by adequate abstraction layers in kernel and userland
e.g. audio, bus_space, microtime, pmap, bioctl, gpioctl, sensorsd, watchdogd, ...




towards a very machine-independent source tree
reduces the effort required to make a new port
makes maintaining multiple platforms easier
