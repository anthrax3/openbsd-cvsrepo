What was done - additional drivers


New apm(4) driver spin-off for the Zaurus and enabled apm(8) and apmd(8) in the base system

no APM BIOS of course - we just want to use the existing userland framework

battery readings are not accurate - we only have a voltage without any other information

implemented battery charging - grrr, everything must be done by hand in this machine  >:-|
