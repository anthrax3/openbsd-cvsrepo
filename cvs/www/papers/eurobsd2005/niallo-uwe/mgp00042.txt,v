What was done - amendment


Last notes before we talk about what we learned...

In the previous discussion of what was done we distorted the steps just a wee little bit to highlight important aspects of the porting process

The order in which the steps were done, in particular, did not always match reality.  In reality, many things were going on in parallel, since many developers worked on the port at the same time

We also did not mention the effort put into writing and updating the online documentation and web pages for the new port
