What was done - single-user/bsd.rd


Time to mention that the RAMDISK kernel is a very important tool in bringing up a new machine

includes its own root filesystem, so it is self-contained

includes a shell and all the tools needed to install OpenBSD later on

helps to test and debug early device drivers before any network or mass storage devices are usable

The next thing to do then was to work on device drivers...
