Hardware details - other ICs


Plus some application-specific ICs (CPLD or FPGA)

Touch screen controller
LCD backlight brightness controller


CF socket and GPIO controller aka "SCOOP" (x2)
complements the PXA7x PCMCIA controller: selects card voltage, triggers card resets, provides maskable interrupt on card change, etc.
its GPIO output signals are like tentacles reaching into all parts of the machine, they control many things
we haven't completely figured out yet what all the register bits are
