@Replacing broken APIs

Direct replacement of missing APIs works well, but broken APIs are more difficult

Differences in function prototypes between platform-supplied function and replacement can cause compilation failures

Replacing broken platform-supplied functions is critical for secure code
Example: snprintf's return value

OpenSSH example: RFC3493 replacements
getnameinfo(), getaddrinfo()

To avoid clashes, we use an ugly (but useful) trick:
#define the name out of the way
Make sure you #define after inclusion of system headers
