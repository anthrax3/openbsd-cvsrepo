@Choosing the right API (continued)

Secure portability is not picking a lowest common denominator

It is usually easy to replace missing APIs when they aren't there
More difficult to make software use them when they are

Modern systems typically include good APIs anyway
If they aren't there already, then they will probably be in the next release
Why write your applications for yesterday's systems?
