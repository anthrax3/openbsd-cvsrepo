@Beyond simple API replacement (continued)

To cope, we step back a little and offer an abstract API that provides a superset of platform's requirements

The loginrec API in portable OpenSSH hides the detail of updating all these files behind four simple operations:
Record a login
Record a logout
Record a failed login attempt
Find the time of the user's last login

This keeps the (already hairy) session code free of fiddly platform-specific details
