@Introduction

Why port?
Greater audience
Porting exposes wrong assumptions and latent bugs

What we will cover?
Platform differences: simple, complex and dangerous
Portable OpenSSH's approach to dealing with them
API choice

Our focus:
C language with a reasonably modern Unix/POSIX API
Inclination towards free software

OpenSSH
The most widely-used SSH implementation on the Internet
Primary version is maintained in OpenBSD's CVS tree
Portability team makes it run on 25+ platforms
This arrangement works surprisingly well
