@Missing APIs (continued)

In the previous example, the whole mess could be replaced with a single daemon() replacement

Not enough just to move the mess to a different file
Improves readability, but does yield the other benefits
Instead, replace recursively

Rather than writing your own replacement, borrow one from a free OS (e.g. OpenBSD)
Tested, audited and actively maintained
Not writing code saves you effort
