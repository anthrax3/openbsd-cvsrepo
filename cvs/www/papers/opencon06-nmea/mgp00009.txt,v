Diversion: Sensors


Sensors provide operational status of devices like temperatures, fan speeds, etc.

Sensors are read-only values that can be queried using the sysctl mechanism:  sysctl hw.sensors

Sensors have a name, description, value, a state, and a timestamp

Timedelta sensors indicate the error of the system time in nanoseconds
