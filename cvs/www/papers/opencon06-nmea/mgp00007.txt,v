Use adjtime(2) or settimeofday(2) ?


Consider the type of the software that is running

cron(8):  Needs all time units to start programs

Other software might rely on accuracy of the tickrate

If both types run:  Changing the time yields unpredictable results.  The system time should better not be adjusted at runtime

But keep in mind:  OpenBSD is not a realtime OS
