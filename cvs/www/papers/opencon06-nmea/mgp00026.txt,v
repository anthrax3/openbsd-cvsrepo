Summary


Timedelta sensors are a convenient mechanism to get at time

nmea(4)
Works with almost all GPS receivers
Serial-, USB-, and PCMCIA-attached devices
Highest possible precision with PPS capable devices

udcf(4)
Almost no hardware dependency (other than having USB)
Limited precision (as polling over USB is needed)

Both are "precise enough for most applications(tm)"
