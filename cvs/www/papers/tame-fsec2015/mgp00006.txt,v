Other solutions


capsicum, seccomp, etc

Not be speaking about other solutions - not interesting to me

It would not be a fair comparison

tame() implementation is only 1200 lines of code

programs can use it with 3-10 changes

100 programs tame()'d, fairly easily

Serious programmers can re-hoist their programs to use tame in
more sophisticated ways
