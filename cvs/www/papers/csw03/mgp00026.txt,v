3.3 release & future plans


Will be released May 1

Will contain most of the described changes, except

i386 PROT_EXEC best effort
powerpc PROT_EXEC best effort
Simply not enough time to get those debugged...

c2k3 hackathon in Calgary in May: 60 developers

DARPA runs out soon, and once it does, donations or other grants would be really nice
