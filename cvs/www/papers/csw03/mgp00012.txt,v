httpd changes


By default, httpd jails inside in /var/www

-u flag indicates "turn off this feature"

Before self-jailing:
modules are loaded
Things which need write access (logs)
/dev/*random, /dev/log

Automatically translates paths inside configuration file

Most people do NOT run cgi

Most people do NOT run php

For those who do not, this is a more secure choice.
