Randomized mapping for shared objects

Try to find a way to map the main program randomly (ELF does not do so)

Randomized mmap

malloc & mmap that fragment slightly -> insert guard pages

guard pages in the data segment?

link all non-buffer objects near start of data segment, BEFORE buffers?


Any other ideas?

Note: We will not violate POSIX, so don't just say PAX and expect me to smile
