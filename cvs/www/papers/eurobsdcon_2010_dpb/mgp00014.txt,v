@In practice

Good enough even if everything is not known
too slow: sorting repeatedly thru 3000 packages in perl
physics again: use bins
seperate queue according to build time
each bin is 4 times as big as the next one
fastest machine has access to everything
other boxes are limited to their current bin
good enough in practice
