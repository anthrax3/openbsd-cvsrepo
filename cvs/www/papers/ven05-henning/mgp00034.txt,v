crazy ideas for future releases


this requires very very extensive and intrusive changes

state table internals in pf need to change
no more direction in the state key
throw all pf-specific parts out
two pointers to a new pf-specific state info struct instead, one per direction
what to do with interface bound states?
they are actually useless and just band-aid to work around problems resulting from other hacks
route-to needs to die and replaced by real policy routing, with pf as classifier 

I did mention this isn't easy, right? :)
