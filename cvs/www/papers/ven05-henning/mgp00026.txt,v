ospfd, bgpd and the routing table


instead, we want them to install the routes they learn blindly
use RTF_MPATH, so there can be more than one route per prefix
store the route origin (BGP/OSPF/...) with it
kernel knows that static takes precedence over bgp, etc
same for other routing daemons, if anyone wants to hack on IS-IS, drop me a mail :) 

extensive changes, not as easy as it sounds. hope to attack that soon.
