route labels


pf can filter based on these labels
    pass in on egress from route foo keep state

of course, pf can be used to assign traffic to QoS queues as well...
    pass from route TELEKOM_ITALIA keep state queue reallyslow

route labels are stored seperately, and are referred to via an ID

this ID allocator is now used for the pftable stuff as well, saves 14 bytes per AS path
