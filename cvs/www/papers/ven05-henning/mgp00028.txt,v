congestion indicator in stack and pf


when a network card receives a packet, it interrupts
or after a defined amount of packets or time, with int mitigation

interrupt handler peels the packets out of the RX rings and places them in a protocol dependent input queue
protocol dependent, but interface independent
ipintrq for IPv4, ip6intrq for v6

a "soft interrupt" gets scheduled
