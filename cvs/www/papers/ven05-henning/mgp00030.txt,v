congestion indicator in stack and pf


when the ipintrq runs full, the kernel obviously spent all CPU time in interrupt handling and/or soft interrupt handling
so this is a very good indicator of CPU exhaustion
set a flag indicating the fact, and a timer to clear the flag one tick (10ms) later

when ipintrq is full, new packets are just being dropped
