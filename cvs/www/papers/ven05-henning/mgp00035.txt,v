crazy ideas for future releases


stateful routing is extra hard. there are like 1,000,000 possible races
we do have a pretty solid concept on how to solve these without noteworthy performance impact in the forwarding path, but it is too complicated to detail here :)

it must be clear that pf is the only subsystem that actually inserts states
it has all the bells and whistles to fight state table exhaustion

when there is no state, fall back to the regular path
no pf enabled, everything works like it does now
