crazy ideas for future releases


of course, there is even more crazy ideas, but where's the fun when I tell you everything already?

keep supporting us so we can impliment at least some of these things

buy our CDs, Shirts and stuff, and donate if you can

maybe companies can fund some some developers to hack on OpenBSD exclusively for a while
