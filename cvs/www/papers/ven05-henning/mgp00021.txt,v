bgpd gets a second control socket, at a to-be-specified location
    control-socket /var/www/logs/bgpd.sock restricted

as indicated by the "restricted" keyword, the socket does only allow for certain messages, namely, the "show" operations

running the httpd in a chroot (default on OpenBSD), a cgi would just call a bgpctl binary inside the chroot, giving the path to the socket and the commands
    /somewhere/bgpctl -s /log/bgpd.sock $commands
