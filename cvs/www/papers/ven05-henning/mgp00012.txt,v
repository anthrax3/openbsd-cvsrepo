default interface groups


some interface groups exist by default

for cloned interfaces, there is a class group
"lo" contains all loopback interfaces
"carp" has all carp interfaces
"tun" has all tun interfaces

the group "egress" contains all interfaces that have a v4 or v6 default route pointing to them
updated whenever a default route changes
already mpath capable, even given we don't really use that yet
