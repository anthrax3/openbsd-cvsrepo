crazy ideas for future releases


of course, with the fast path offloaded, there is DoS attacks forcing us to the slow path

on the other hand, established connections should not be affected at all

and after all, we're handling amounts then that are completely impossible now

this problem needs to be understood and taken into account
many current router designs work similar, look at their solution attempts and learn from their failures
