PF: Interface abstraction


we need (want) more information in pf
e. g. pass/block counters per direction and address family
relatively easy to solve: just use a struct with the extra info and a pointer to the ifnet struct

some interfaces can appear at runtime
USB, Cardbus, PCIe, ...
clonables: lo, carp, ppp, tun, trunk, ...
