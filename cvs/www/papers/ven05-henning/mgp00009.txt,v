PF: Interface abstraction


it is pretty obvious the interface abstraction code has its tentacles almost everywhere in the stack

the code was not en par with other pf code, and none of the current developers familiar with it

Ryan and I sitting in front of the same laptop display and about a week of time solved that
ripped out everything, added pieces back, replaced large chunks

adding new features, notably, the interface groups support, added later
