crazy ideas for future releases


of course, bgpd development won't stop either

adding stuff needed for bigger route servers
best path selection in the output path, after applying policies

better integration with ospfd

support MPLS VPN extensions

check out the 32bit-AS-number draft, show its failures and work on a better alternative before worker bees at vendors are forced to implement it
