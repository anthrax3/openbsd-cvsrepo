IPv6 support


yes, we have IPv6 support now

IPv6 transport has been there since I got bored at some "exploiting windows" talk at CanSecWest 2004

IPv6 RIB is there since What The Hack 2005

almost everything works just like it does for v4

bgpctl has an address family parameter now

test, test, test!
