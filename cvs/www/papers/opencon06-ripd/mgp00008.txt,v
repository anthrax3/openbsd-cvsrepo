General infos


NOT interoperable with RIPv1
too old and mostly useless nowadays

Strictly compliant with RFC 2543 and RFC 2082
even if still not completely

Based on routing daemons framework first developed by henning

Control information can be easily obtained with ripctl(8)

Same configuration file model of other routing daemons
