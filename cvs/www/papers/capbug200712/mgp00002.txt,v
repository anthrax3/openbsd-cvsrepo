Introduction

This presentation is meant to accompany Bernd Ahlers' OpenBSD Ports Tutorial given at OpenCON 2007:
http://www.openbsd.org/papers/opencon07-portstutorial/index.html

Bernd's tutorial covered building and packaging a simple port.  This talk will expand on that example to cover MULTI_PACKAGES.  Then, we will cover
FLAVORS, portslogger, configure scripts, MODULE= and perl ports.
