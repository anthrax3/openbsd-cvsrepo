MULTI_PACKAGES (DESCR-*/PLIST-*)

With MULTI_PACKAGES, the package description file and the packing list file need to be split or copied amongst the different subpackages.  In the case of Iodine, move pkg/DESCR to DESCR-main.  Create a new DESCR-server to describe the server component.

Also, move the PLIST file to PLIST-main.  In this case, you can copy PLIST-main to PLIST-server and then remove the other package's components from each PLIST file.

The MULTI_PACKAGES PLISTS cannot have overlapping components.
