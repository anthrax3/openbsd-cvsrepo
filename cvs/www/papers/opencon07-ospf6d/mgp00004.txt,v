How does it work

Hello packets via multicast used for router discovery
only minimal config needed

Reliable flooding used to distribute the link states
every router has the same info
link states build a graph representing the network topology

shortest path first (SPF) calculation on this graph
Dijkstra algorithm spews out the routing table

network can be split into independent areas
large graphs need a lot of CPU to calculate
faster calculation but maybe less optimal routing
