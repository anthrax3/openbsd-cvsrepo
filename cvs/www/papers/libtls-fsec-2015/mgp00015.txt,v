You can't rely on errno in libtls

In libtls, failure (-1) is always failure.

As opposed to "but wait, check errno, it's not really a failure"

tls_read() and tls_write() clear the global errno variable.

This is to prevent callers from mishandling error conditions. 

libtls provides tls_error() to get an error message on failure.
