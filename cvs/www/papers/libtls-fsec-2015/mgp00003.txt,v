Some Background. LibreSSL vs OpenSSL. 

In May 2014, 30 days into LibreSSL, we reported that:

OpenSSL 1.0.1g was 388,000 lines of C code.

We had deleted about 150,000 lines of files from 1.0.1g

This included deleting about 90,000 lines of C source code 

This at the time was approximately a 500,000 line unidiff.
