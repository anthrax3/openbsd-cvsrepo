So, where are we?

Longer Term Goals

- We have done significantly better than OpenSSL on security issues.

- New api. More sane. Evolving

- Code base further reduced from base OpenSSL, Important new stuff added.

- We are as portable as OpenSSL to anything you should care about.

- We are ready to start splitting libcrypto from libssl.
