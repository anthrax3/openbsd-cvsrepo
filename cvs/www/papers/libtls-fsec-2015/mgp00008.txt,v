I don't know the OpenSSL API, Why is this better?

Because mortals can use it. 

"secure" (default)

"legacy" (compat)

Consider "classic" dumb client and server example in C from an undergraduate course.

You need to add 30-40 lines of code to such a program to do make it do TLS 1.2 with the client validating a pinned server certificate.
 
High security choices are the default.

It is one line of code to dumb it down to accept legacy TLS and legacy ciphers.
