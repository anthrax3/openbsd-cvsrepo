libtls got a lot of love this week

Hours spent on next gen API and discussions of how to get further away from libssl.

Revamped current tls_read/tls_write to provide enough of read/write semantics to be usable.

Client side certificate verification support was added

Cert pinning (hash) support was added

Functions to access info from the certificate were added.
