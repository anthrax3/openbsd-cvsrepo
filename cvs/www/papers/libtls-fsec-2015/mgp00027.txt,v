Challenges

Extensive public API that needs to be reduced/modernized as the ecosystem adapts. 

We are pushing the ecosystem forward. We do the hard things first.

Time and Money - We would specifically like to sponsor 2-3 developers for 6 months at least

If your employer would be interested in assisting in this effort, please direct them to:
