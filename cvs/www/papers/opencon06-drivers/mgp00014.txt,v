Memory buffers, aka mbufs

mbufs are a linked list of structures extensively used
in the networking code.

The linked list is usually referred to as an mbuf chain.
When the data in the chain exceeds a set threshold the structures
then don't store data internally but each point to a external
chunk of memory of MCLBYTES long known as a cluster.

Several chains form a queue, the header of each mbuf chain
contains a pointer to the next mbuf chain in the queue.

bus_dma gives us bus_dmamap_load_mbuf() which lets us
map an mbuf chains for DMA relatively easily.

See the mbuf(9) man page for more discussion.
