Fallout - version 1

My pivots broke random (oops)
Hints didn't quite work out

Lots of fallout on 64-bit platforms:
JIT in every browser broke
firefox, chrome and webkit are bad boys
JIT in everything else broke
java is a bad boy too
mono fixed their bugs within a few days

Each fix for userspace made kernel space die horribly
