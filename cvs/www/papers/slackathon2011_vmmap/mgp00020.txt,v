Algorithm - version 2

Carve up the map space for userland
i386:
first 512 MB is for exe mappings
second 512 MB is not allocated (used for library/program data)

64-bit architectures:
below 4 GB is only allocated from if the hint is below 4 GB
otherwise, allocate only from 4+ GB memory

always in effect:
no allocation will be more than 2 GB away from the hint
