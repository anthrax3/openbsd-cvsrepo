@Portability
Portability FROM OpenBSD

Code developed on OpenBSD is generally easy to port to other posix systems
Some secure functions may not be available on your target platform
Reimplementing/porting the functions is better than using the insecure versions
 
See "Secure Portability" by Damien Miller for proven portability techniques; used for OpenSSH.
