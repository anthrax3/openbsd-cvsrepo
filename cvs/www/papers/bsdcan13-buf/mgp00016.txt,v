The Page Daemon. 

OpenBSD's buffer cache is (deliberately) subservient to uvm. 

Page daemon steals memory from the buffer cache, down to a minimum. 

Numerous page daemon issues found while attempting to get this right. 

Fun things:
Reduce yourself to about 40 pages of mappable kva.
Run on a 16 MB hp300 (yes, we still run on these..)
Build X on sparc (SS20, yes, we still run on these)
Zaurus.. (It's so cute and japanese..)

But Mom - I didn't want to grow up to be a UVM hacker... I just want to..
