Project Infrastructure


Servers are in my house (colocation is not an option)

Repository, builds, and communication at my house

Development happens around world, at developer's homes, or
at hackathons (held at Universities)

Distribution is pushed once to a University, then mirrored

Network: AS22512, three /23 IPv4 blocks, BGP

Permission to join Canarie (EDU routing) since 2008


The problem: My house is in Canada
