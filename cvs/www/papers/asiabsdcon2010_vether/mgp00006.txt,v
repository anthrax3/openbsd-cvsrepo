Multihoming


Want to BGP multihome, but need 1500 MTU on all external routes

PMTU is another very good IETF joke... ha ha very funny

MSS fixups are not acceptable for a project with global ssh logins

If we can get "link" to the University, we get Canarie (EDU) routing

Solution?

IPSEC Ether-over-IP --> IP fragmentation
|
5Mb+5Mb Business cable modem
|
defragmentation  --> IPSEC Ether-over-IP machine
