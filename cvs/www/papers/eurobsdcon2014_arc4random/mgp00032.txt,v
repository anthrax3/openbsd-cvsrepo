Slicing up the stream (in the kernel)


Lots of activities slice random data from the (sole) kernel stream:

random pid (fork, thread creation)
ASLR mappings, mmap (including userland malloc / free requests)

packet creation! sequence numbers.

pf NAT and other operations

port allocation

scheduler decisions!

and... userland arc4random re-seedings via getentropy(2)
