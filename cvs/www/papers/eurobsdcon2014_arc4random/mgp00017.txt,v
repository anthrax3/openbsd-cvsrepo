But the API name remains the same


Don't worry about the name:

    The original version of this random number generator used
    the RC4 (also known as ARC4) algorithm.  In OpenBSD 5.5 it was
    replaced with the ChaCha20 cipher, and it may be replaced again
    in the future as cryptographic techniques advance.  A good mnemonic
    is ``A Replacement Call for Random''.

Proposed alternative names: posix_random() or goodrandom()
