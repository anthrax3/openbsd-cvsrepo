Features gained by sharing


Backtracking resistance

    Past offsets of the stream likely were (invisibly) given to other
    recipients, so the past cannot be determined

Prediction resistance

    Since future parts of the stream will be (invisibly) snipped by
    other recipients, the future cannot be predicted.

There is no formal proof of these qualities, but the ideas seem sound...
