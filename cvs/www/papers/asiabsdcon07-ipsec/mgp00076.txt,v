Redundancy with sasyncd(8)

sasyncd(8) is a daemon for synchronising SADB between hosts in
a carp(4) failover cluster.

isakmpd(8), carp(4) AND pfsync(4) are mandatory
master and slave topology
no support for loadbalancing IPsec
monitors the PFKEYv2 socket on the master host
sasync messages are sent to the slave when the sadb changes
