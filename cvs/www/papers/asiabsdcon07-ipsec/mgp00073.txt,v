Securing IPsec with keynote(5) and pf(4)

We can use pf(4) to filter packets

PF Syntax Note:
OpenBSD 4.1 and later use keep state flags S/SA as default for all pass rules

pass in on enc0 proto ipencap keep state (if-bound)

pass in on enc0 proto tcp from any to 10.0.1.10 port = ssh keep state (if-bound)
