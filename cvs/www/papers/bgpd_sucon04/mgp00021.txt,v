bgpd - Parent process, kernel interface


Listens to the routing socket
Internal view of the kernel routing table is held in sync
If you fiddle with the routing table manually, we notice that and cope with it
Internal list of interfaces and their status is kept in sync
We know about interfaces' link status and use it for nexthop verification
Yes, we notice when you pull the cable!

We don't need periodic nexthop table walks
