bgpd - ipsec integration


We can use isakmpd to do the keying for us
keys are changed on a regular basis

bgpd asks the kernel for an unused pair of SPIs and uses them

bgpd sets up the flows
it knows the endpoints and ports already

isakmpd only needs to handle the keying
almost NO configuration needed!
copy key files (generated at first boot on OpenBSD 3.6) over
run "isakmpd -Ka"
