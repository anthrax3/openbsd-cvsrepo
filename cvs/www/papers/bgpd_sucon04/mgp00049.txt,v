Thanks

Claudio Jeker <claudio@@openbsd.org>, who's writing most of the RDE and helped enormously with getting these slides to you in time
Andre Oppermann <andre@@freebsd.org>, who designed the RDE with claudio and is paying most of his work on bgpd
Theo de Raadt for kicking my lazy butt so that I eventually started bgpd after thinking about it for at least 2 years, helping with basic design and many many many McNally's we had while discussing bgpd
Wim Vandeputte, for his continued support and beer supply
(we're far from your house this time, your fridge is safe)
