BGP - Existing Implementations


Zebra: GPL, makes heavy use of cooperative threads. Suffers from loosing sessions while busy. Documentation and error messages in japanese or missing. Commercialized, thus mostly dead since about 2 years.

Quagga: frustrated zebra users try to fix the worst bugs

gated: became unfree, then died. Nothing really usable left.
