Future Work (Upcoming OpenBSD Hackathon)

Greylist Synchronization

Spamd currently doesn't have a good way to keep a greylist in synch between a primary and an off-site mx. It needs this, and will get a simple little protocol to share the greylisting updates

Blacklist and Whitelist Sharing

Spamd stores these internally. 

Future work to move out to pf tables, allow for sharing with bgp
