Make use of that 30 minutes!

Use a blacklist if you can - spammers find their way into them.	greylist gives ttime for hosts to be blacklisted.

spamdb | script

Perl your way through your greylist. make your own decisions about what you see, and spamdb -d the ones you don't like...

Use new features - Greytrapping, and Initial Stuttering
