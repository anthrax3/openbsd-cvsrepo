i386 and PAE NX


Some newer i386 cpus will contain per-page execute control


              Some processors have a NX (non-executable) bit... 

The PAE NX bit works in 32-bit or 64-bit processing mode
(OpenBSD/amd64 uses it).

Not quite as good as the X bit found on other processors

PAE NX coming soon from Transmeta, VIA C3, maybe even Intel...
