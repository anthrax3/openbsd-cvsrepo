StackGhost: A sparc specific buffer overflow protection method


  stackghost.cerias.purdue.edu/stackghost.pdf

Register window architectures: For now, Sparc v6/v7/v8



Each time a function call is made, the latter 3 sets "rotate"


The processor has a limited set of registers on-chip.. so cpu traps
to SPILL & FILL handlers in the kernel to store registers to
memory, or refetch registers from memory -- on the stack.
