@PIE By Default

Compiles will include -fpie by default unless other flags are seen
Linking will include -pie by default unless other flags are seen
Almost all objects become position independent
larger code
slower too
Any non-pic assembly will need to be converted or not use pie
Open Questions
how much ramdisk growth?
performance measurements?
Base system works well for all dynamic programs
Initial testing of ports tree promising
Much more testing needed
