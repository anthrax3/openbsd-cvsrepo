Before you get your hands dirty...

Please make sure that a port for the software you want to create isn't already in the tree and that no one is already working on it.

To do so you can...

search the ports tree (make search key=foobar and databases/sqlports are your friends)

search the mailing list archives (e.g. http://marc.info/?l=openbsd-ports)

ask on the ports mailing list (ports@@openbsd.org)
