Short history

The ports tree and the package tools in OpenBSD originally came from FreeBSD about 12 years ago.

It has been heavily modified since then and diverged quite a lot from its originator.

Some examples:

rewrite of the package tools

FLAVORS and MULTI_PACKAGES

the FAKE framework

building with systrace(1)
