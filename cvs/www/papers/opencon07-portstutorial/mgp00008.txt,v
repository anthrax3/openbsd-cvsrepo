Set up your work environment

IMPORTANT:The ports tree is developed against -current !

That means you need a -current base system and a checkout of the -current ports tree. (CVS HEAD revision)

We don't support a -current ports tree on a release or -stable base system.

It might work, but you'll be on your own.
