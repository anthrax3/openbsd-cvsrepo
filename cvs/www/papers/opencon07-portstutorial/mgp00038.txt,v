Conclusion

This was the normal way of creating a port.

Of course, sometimes it's necessary to repeat some steps over and over until you have fixed all things.

This was actually a really easy example, but it should be enough to get an idea of how it works.

If you are porting really big applications like GNOME or OpenOffice things become much more complicated. You'll have to deal with huge dependency chains, lots of patches, long compile times and other stuff you don't want to know about yet. ;)

(Just ask jasper@@ and robert@@...)
