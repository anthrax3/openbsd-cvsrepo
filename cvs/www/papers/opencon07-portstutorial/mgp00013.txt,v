Set up your work environment (cont.)

/etc/mk.conf

WRKOBJDIR=/usr/obj/ports
The working directory will be created in the specified path. This helps keep the ports tree clean.

USE_SYSTRACE=Yes
Systrace will help you to detect ports which are installing files outside of the fake directory, trying to connect to remote servers during the build or doing other weird stuff.
