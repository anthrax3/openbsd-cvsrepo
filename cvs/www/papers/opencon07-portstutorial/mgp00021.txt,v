Step 3 - fetch

Now we're going to fetch the distfile from the MASTER_SITES.

$ make fetch
===>  Checking files for iodine-0.4.0
>> iodine-0.4.0.tar.gz doesn't seem to exist on this system.
>> Fetch http://code.kryo.se/iodine/iodine-0.4.0.tar.gz.
100% |**************************************************| 30075       00:01    
>> Checksum file does not exist
$

The iodine-0.4.0.tar.gz can now be found in/usr/ports/distfiles now.
