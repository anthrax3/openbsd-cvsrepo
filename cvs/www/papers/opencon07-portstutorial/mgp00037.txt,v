Step 15 - package

To actually create and install the package, just run:

$ make package 
===>  Building package for iodine-0.4.0
Create /usr/ports/packages/i386/all/iodine-0.4.0.tgz
Link to /usr/ports/packages/i386/ftp/iodine-0.4.0.tgz
Link to /usr/ports/packages/i386/cdrom/iodine-0.4.0.tgz
$

$ make install
===>  Verifying specs:  c z
===>  found c.42.0 z.4.1
===>  Installing iodine-0.4.0 from /usr/ports/packages/i386/all/
iodine-0.4.0: complete    
$

All files from the fake area have been packaged into the iodine-0.4.0.tgz package and then installed via the package tools.
