@Working replace

In 2005 pkg_add -r did start working.
OpenBSD was able to update packages by specifying a list of new packages
Replacing one package at a time
Start on the inside (packages with no dependencies)
End on the outside (packages with all dependencies)
Safe: each individual replacement was checked before performing it.
