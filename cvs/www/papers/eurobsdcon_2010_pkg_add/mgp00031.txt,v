@Look ma, no database

Half a design goal was to keep things dead simple: we stored text files and under /var/db/pkg, and we cache absolutely nothing.

As an OpenBSD developer, I'm totally paranoid. cache synchronization does fuck up. If I can get one less failure point, I want to!

So we get update information on the go: open package, scan beginning of packing-list, close package.

It was a game: how far can we get with no db.
