@pkg_add -u, cheating version

Running pkg_add -r is tedious: you must know all package names.
Let's discover them instead (Aug. 2005).

We have clean package names: stem-version-flavor
To update, look at packages that share the same stem
Keep only the packages that conflict
Keep only packages coming from the same ports directory
