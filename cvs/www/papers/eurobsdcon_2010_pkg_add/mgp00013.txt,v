@A design observation

Most package tools are built as "smart" tools that call "dumb" tools.
This is wrong WRONG WRONG !!!


Dumb tools will use only the information they need. Smart tools have to "discover" things: deduce semantic information from what dumb tools tell them, and reparse stuff to get additional info.

Lots of processing power wasted. Redoing the same thing over and over. Problems in dumb tools are hard to solve, because dumb tools don't have enough information to take smart action.
