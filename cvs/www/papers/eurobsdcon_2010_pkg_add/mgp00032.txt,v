@Look ma, no database

Turns out we could go ALL THE WAY.

We still do not have any database.

Big toll on ftp (lots of open/close connections).
We have plans for http.

Good design: 
forces sensible package names.
pkg_add can deduce most things from package names, 
and so can the user.
There are few exceptions.
