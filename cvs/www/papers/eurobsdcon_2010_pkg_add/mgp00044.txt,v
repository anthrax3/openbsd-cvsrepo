@Looking back

The main mistake I did was not look at version numbers earlier.
Cheating on pkg_add -r was very costly.
People didn't get the rules for pkg_add -u.
After adding a lot of error messages to pkg_add, and fixing problems, we have clean stuff now.

It is still complicated, but it is solving a complicated problem !

Current pkg_add (and tools) is 15000 lines of perl.
