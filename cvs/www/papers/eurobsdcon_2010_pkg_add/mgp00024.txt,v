@Solving the library problem, packages

Package dependencies: do libraries independently.
A package that wants a given library has a @@wantlib in its packing-list.
This @@wantlib is inserted very late
and dependent on the current system.

Packages register their libraries: those files are tagged with @@lib.

A library will be found 
if there's a @@lib that matches a @@wantlib somewhere
in the @@depend tree during installation 
or in the base system
