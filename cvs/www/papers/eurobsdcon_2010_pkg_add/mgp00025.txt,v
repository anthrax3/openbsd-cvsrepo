@Solving the library problem, updates

Ties between @@lib and @@wantlib are stored under /var/db/pkg.
During an update, 
old libraries are kept and put in stub packages.
They're only replaced if the ABI is the same.
The stub packages can be removed 
once all dependent packages have been updated.

Maximal reuse:
stub packages are normal packages
