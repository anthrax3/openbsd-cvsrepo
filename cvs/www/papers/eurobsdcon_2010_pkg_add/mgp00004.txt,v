@Some design goals

Focus on binary packages. Only porters should build packages (Theo's insight)
Be safe. C is fast and everything, but a summary audit of pkg_add showed tons of possible buffer overflows.
Having updates would be cool eventually.
Stop reinventing the wheel. We shouldn't have tens of scripts that parse package manifests.
Be fast. Users don't want to wait for packages.
