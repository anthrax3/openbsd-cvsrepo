@Transactional vs. provable semantics

A lot of package systems out there do transactional semantics.
try to update
if it f* up, go back to previous state.

We do provable replacements
compute as much as we can to ensure things won't fail
once we're satisfied, do the replacement (that can't fail)

Works most of the time
We now have tools (pkg_check, 2010) in the remaining cases.
