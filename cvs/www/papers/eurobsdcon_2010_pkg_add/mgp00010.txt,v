The initial replacement got faster than the C version.

The C version used external tar(1), where the perl version unpacked its archive itself (using its own Ustar module), so no staging area required.

Turned out the most expensive operation was copying files around.

Dropped-in replacement for pkg_add/pkg_delete in 2003:
no showstopper bug!
Used Ustar write support for pkg_create in 2005
