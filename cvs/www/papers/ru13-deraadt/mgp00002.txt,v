In 2000, OpenBSD started a development initiative to
intentionally make the process memory environment
LESS PREDICTABLE and LESS ROBUST without impacting
well-behaved programs.

It has taken more than 10 years to finish the task.

Most of these ideas are now adopted by other systems.

A status report is needed.
