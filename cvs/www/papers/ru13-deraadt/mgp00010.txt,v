Introducing W^X: A better page permission policy


Many bugs are exploitable because the address space has memory
that is both writeable and executable (permissions = W | X)


this location has to be executable
for the exploit to work

We could make the stack non-executable...

Hmmmm... how about a generic policy for
the whole address space:
    A page may be either writeable or
    executable, but not both (unless the
    program specifically requests)

We call this policy  W ^ X      (W xor X)

Let's see how far we can apply it!
