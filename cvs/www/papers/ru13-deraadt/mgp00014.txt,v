W^X Transition: Applying policy to GOT/ctor/dtors




GOT and PLT get their own
pages and become non-writeable
(and we teach ld.so how to cope)

dtors/ctors move in with the
GOT, thus become non-writeable

Now the data segment has no
objects with X permission!

We made a few things
non-writeable (for free)








No page has both W and X bits!
Policy achieved.
