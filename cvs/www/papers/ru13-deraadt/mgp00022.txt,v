Other benefits of mmap() malloc()


When you free()  an object >= pagesize

it gets unmapped using munmap()

Therefore, access after free() becomes a detectable crash

Detecting buffer overflow, over"read"

If you try to read/write beyond the end of an object,
maybe there is a guard page there?

Future goals

Be more proactive with placing allocations next to guards

Or using "padding" guards
