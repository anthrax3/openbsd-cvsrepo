Concept: How can we increase resiliance?


The process memory environment is made up of a mix of
well-defined and undefined behaviours.

How much of the 'undefined' can we change and have things
still work?


Don't want to break normal/expected behaviours

But maybe change anything else which makes exploits
hard/impossible?

As long as the performance cost is insignificant / very low..
