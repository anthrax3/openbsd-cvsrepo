W^X Transition: The .rodata segment


Readonly strings and pointers were stored in the .text segment: X | R

Meaning const data could be executed (could be code an
attacker could use as ROP payload)

Solution: start using the ELF .rodata segment

These objects are now only R, lost their X permission

Greater policy: "minimal set of permissions"
