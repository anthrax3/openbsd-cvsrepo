StackGhost


A sparc/sparc64-specific buffer overflow protection mechanism

     stackghost.cerias.purdue.edu/stackghost.pdf

These register-window architectures have backup-storage for the
registers (reserved in each stack frame)

StackGhost is a scheme where the register-window SPILL/FILL
trap handlers XOR the frame-pointer register (%i7) with a
per-process random cookie ("wcookie")

Protects registers from modification while they reside in the
stack frame (%i7 itself, or the next frame it points to...)


Like a weak Stack Protector... but zero cycle overhead.
