Continue to update crypto, and ask authors for decently licensed versions. 

This has already been very successful as we have added a number of cipher suites to libcrypto that were not available in OpenSSL 1.0.1g. This has already included:
Brainpool
ChaCha
poly1305
ANSSI FRP256v1 
Several new cipher suites based on the above.
