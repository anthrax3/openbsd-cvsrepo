FIPS mode is gone, it's never coming back. 

The OpenSSL "Foundation" is basically a FIPS consultancy - We are not. We believe this creates a priority inversion to the needs of the larger community.

FIPS is actively harmful to the security of the library

There's room enough in the ecosystem for other implementations. People needing FIPS can use OpenSSL, or someone who is interested could perhaps FIPS certify LibreSSL.

FIPS is not a goal of LibreSSL.
