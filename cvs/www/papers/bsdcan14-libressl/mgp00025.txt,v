ROP coding function - call this to jump anywhere!
An assembly function that allows you to jump to any arbitrary address in a program - this is a ROP coders dream - and it's in regular OpenSSL. 

Backward compatibility for a mistake that lasted a month - for 14 years!

"Weaponized" Comic Sans:

"This page scientifically designed to annoy web hipsters - donate now"

Actually quite sad that far more people will express their outrage over the use of Comic Sans on a web site than reading the asn1 code and expressing their outrage over that. 

Having said that we did get a nice amount of Paypal donations when I put that up. 

I can now claim on my resume to be the first person to "Weaponize" the comic sans font.
