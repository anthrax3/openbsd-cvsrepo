We have sent many things to Valhalla [1]...

-Ebcdic support
-DOS support
-MacOS Classic support (pre os-10)
-Win16 and other many flavours of Windows support
-Obtuse things you've never heard of..
-VMS support [2]
-etc. etc. etc. etc. etc.

These are in the way. Get rid of them. this is tens of thousands of lines of awful hacks and #ifdef horror (Hello VMS!) that we no longer need to maintain, and work around. 

[1] If norse legends are true Ebcdic will meet me in Valhalla, and we will be friends.
