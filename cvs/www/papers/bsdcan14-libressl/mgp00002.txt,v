About Me.

Consultant, SW developer, Nerd Herder - Available for hire.

Installed OpenBSD on my SparcStation 1+ in 1995 and made the tragic mistake of attempting to order a pizza over the phone to deliver to Theo de Raadt - thereby ruining my life. (I always wanted to be a Lumberjack..)

OpenBSD Foundation Director - http://www.openbsdfoundation.org/
