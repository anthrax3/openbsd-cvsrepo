"This patient requires an emergency KNFectomy"

Seriously, this codebase needs something approaching a consistent style so it can be read by more than one person. 

As we're OpenBSD developers, we're KNF'ing the whole thing. 

It does actually make it more readable, although this sometimes makes other horrors more visible, which is the point.

More readable => more developer involvement.
