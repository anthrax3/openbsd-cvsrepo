More on the allocator and memory functions.

We removed scads of "debugging malloc" and other nasties inside the library (these could send private data to logs). 

The wrappers remain (they are exposed API) but they call intrinsics and are defanged (turning on the debug mode does nothing, trying to replace them at runtime is not allowed). 

The library itself no longer uses them (we use the intrinsic functions): malloc, free, calloc, realloc, reallocarray

Necessary Conversions:
malloc + memset -> calloc
malloc(X*Y) -> reallocarray(X, Y);
realloc and free handle NULL. stop testing everywhere.

Say no to Integer Overflows.
