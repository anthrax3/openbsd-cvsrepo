System Requirements for LibreSSL - A portable version.

- An essentially modern POSIX like environment. 

- OS provided source of good random data. It's readiness and quality are the responsibility of the OS, not LibreSSL.

- malloc/free/calloc/realloc (overflow checking)

- Modern C string capabilities (strl[cat,cpy]) asprintf, etc.

- explicit_bzero, reallocarray

The portability team does need to be careful - we have already seen halphazard "ports" that are completely insecure and should not be used. We want people to work with us on portability who understand our processes, and understand security.
