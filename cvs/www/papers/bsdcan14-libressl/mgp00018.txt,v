Entropy - it's the responsibility of the Operating System. 


If your Operating System can not provide you with a good source of entropy, it will NOT be LibreSSL's job to fake it. (We know we can't do this "right" in a userland library without serious security implications).

Fix your Operating System. Not the SSL library.
