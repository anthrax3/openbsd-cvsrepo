Having said that, Non harmful mandated ciphers are welcome

FIPS is very intrusive. In other places Governments mandate use of certain ciphers (Cameilla, GOST, ANSSI FRP256v1, etc).

As long as these are not on by default, and are provided as clean implementations under and acceptable license we will include them. 

We believe it's better people who have to use these use them in a sane library with a sane API than rolling their own and introducing more bugs
