So far..

OpenSSL 1.0.1g was a 388,000 line code base. 

About 90,000 lines of C source code deleted, about 150,000 lines of files.

Approximately at 500,000 line unidiff from 1.0.1g at this point. 

Many bugs fixed. 

The Cleaning continues, but we have now started adding new features (ciphers)

The code has become more readable - portions still remain scary.
