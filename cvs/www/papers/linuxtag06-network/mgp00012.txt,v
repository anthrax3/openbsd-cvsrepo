OpenOSPFD - Overview

Major points: easy to use, secure, stable
Steal as much as possible

"Stolen" from OpenBGPD
3 processes
Privilege separation
Buffer management
Imsg framework for internal messaging
Kroute - routing table management

Differences
Raw IP packets instead of TCP sessions
More concurrent timers and finite state machines
Use of libevent instead of a poll loop
