OSPF

Link-state protocol

Supports hierarchical routing via areas
SPF calculation per area
Simple route lookup for interarea routes
Workaround for small CPU boxes

Neighbor discovery via multicast hello packets
Implemented as own IP protocol (not TCP or UDP)
No reliable communication
Reliable flooding gets complex

IETF designed
Super complex and badly documented protocol
