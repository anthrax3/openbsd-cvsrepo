@OpenBSD Implementation
PF Randomness

Not everyone uses randomness the way they should...
so we can put it in for them.

Why in the firewall?
We're already tracking connection state - so it's easy
It's expected that a firewall can be agressive about packet modification
Some of the randomness happens anyways, for functional reasons
source port and ip for NAT
The firewall provides fine-grained control of randomness injection
