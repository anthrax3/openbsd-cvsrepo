@Updated network randomness talk.

@OpenBSD Implementation
RIPd MD5-Auth sequence number

Constraints
32 bits
Increasing even after reboot
per KEY + KeyID pair
Cannot be 0 (allows arbitrary replay attacks)
Cannot allow to wrap
System time modulated with a fixed value
Derived from an MD5 hash of the key and key ID

We'd like to do more, but interoperability constrains us.
