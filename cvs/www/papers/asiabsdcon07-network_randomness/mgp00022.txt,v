OpenBSD Implementation

Obviously, we're ignoring pseudo-randomness we inject for explicitly
cryptographic reasons in IPSec, ssh, carp, etc.

In accordance with OpenBSD's "No useless buttons" policy, we turn these on by default. Actually, there is usually no way to turn them off - it's totally transparent to the user.
