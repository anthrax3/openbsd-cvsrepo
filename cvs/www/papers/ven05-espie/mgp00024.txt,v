Example: Packing-lists (cont.)

Adding new keywords, like @@info, or @@man, is simple:
you just derive from existing behavior
you do not need to add stuff in lots of places
because it's common code, and Object-oriented

Writing new tools is simple (visitor pattern)
You just need to write code for objects you want to look at.
