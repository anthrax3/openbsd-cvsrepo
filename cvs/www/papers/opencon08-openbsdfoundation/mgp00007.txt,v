@How can you help?

Cheques preferred (easy to generate receipts)

Bank wire transfers next favourite
details on request

If not cash, then hardware contributions if you need receipts
fair market value

Longer term repeat contributions rather than one-time big ones
remember we must spend money as fast as it comes in
