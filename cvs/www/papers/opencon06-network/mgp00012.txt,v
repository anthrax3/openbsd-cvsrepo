Policy routing - good to know

there is no fall back to the main table
for the moment

nexthop of the route must exist in the main routing table

not possible to bind interfaces to specific tables
virtual routers & customer VPNs need this
can be worked around with pf
        pass in on em4 rtable 3 keep state

multiple tables and multipath routes can be combined
