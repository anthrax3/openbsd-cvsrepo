Routing Priorities - Options

Userland routing management daemon
all other routing tools need to talk to this daemon
daemon does all the decisions and updates the kernel
zebra, quagga and xorp use such a concept
userland daemon needs to track nexthops and a lot of other stuff the kernel is already doing
freaks out with manual intervention
route, dhclient and other tools that modify the table

Kernel manages the different routing sources
decides which is the most preferred route
kernel routing table is always in sync
userland daemons don't need to know about each other
