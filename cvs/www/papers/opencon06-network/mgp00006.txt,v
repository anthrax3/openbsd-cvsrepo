Multipath routing - Internals

multiple routes to the same destination exist in the routing table

routes are linked together via rn_dupedkey
rn_dupedkey is used by the radix tree to store routes with equal address but different mask
linear list -> works OK for a handful of routes

uses the hash of source-destination pairs to schedule connections
no packet reorder problems
all packets from a stream follow the same path
a single connection does not benefit
hash-threshold mechanism reduces impact when routes change
