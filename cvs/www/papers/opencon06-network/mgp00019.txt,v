Route validation

network stack already checks if a route is UP
routes are cached all over the place
ip_output() checks if the passed route is still valid
on delete routes are marked down
route is freed if refcount drops to zero

kernel already tracks the link state
every interface has link state hooks
used in userland by bgpd and ospfd
best effort service
some PHY and interfaces are unable to correctly detect the link state
