Multipath routing - Basic usage

To enable multipath distribution, use:
    # sysctl net.inet.ip.multipath=1
    and or
    # sysctl net.inet6.ip6.multipath=1

add a multipath route
    # route add 192.168.1/24 192.168.0.1
    # route add 192.168.1/24 192.168.0.2 -mpath

remove a multipath route
    # route delete 192.168.1/24 192.168.0.1
nexthop needs to be specified as well!
