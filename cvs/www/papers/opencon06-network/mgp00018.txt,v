The Typical Routing Nightmare

multipath code needed changes
first try resulted in kernel panics
radix tree got corrupted
changes in the radix code were needed

rtrequest1() is where routes are added and removed
sounds simple but
many callers from various places
some in obscure places
rtrequest() / rtrequest1() insanity

lack of time

... code is not ready for commit
