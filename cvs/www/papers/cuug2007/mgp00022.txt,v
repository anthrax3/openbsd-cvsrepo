testing forwarding performance...


these performance tests are actually not all that easy

using two Dell PowerEdge SC1435 as packet generators/receivers
"Dual-Core AMD Opteron(tm) Processor 2210, 1800.31 MHz"
two bge each

either iperf or nc to generate traffic
iperf sucks, need to find sth better
