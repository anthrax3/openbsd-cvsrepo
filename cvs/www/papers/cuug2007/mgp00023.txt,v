testing forwarding performance...


test victim: first a soekris - 266Mhz geode, sucky small caches, sucky ethernet

after ryan's randomness fix and chris int mitigation diff were applied, it could bridge a bit over 90 MBit/s, much to our surprise!
it was somewhere between 30 and 40 MBit/s before the hackathon...

it suffers quite a bit from pf tho, only getting aroun 60 Mbit/s thru it

probably suffers from its tiny cahces... old old old cpu design
