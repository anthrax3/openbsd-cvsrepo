making pf faster


pf needs to keep track of some things it does to packets
save ip header position for altq
queue ID for altq
tag/tagged (as in, the keywords)
ID of the routing table to be used for lookups
count how often route-to kicked in, prevent loops
mark packets generated by pf (block return, ...)
mark packets that were rdr'd to localhost
fragment cache needs a marker too
