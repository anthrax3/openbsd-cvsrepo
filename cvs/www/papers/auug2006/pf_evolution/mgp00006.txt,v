@Design Philosophy
Correct, readable code

PF's clean design allowed many developers to work simultaneously
Fully functional firewall in a few months (1 release cycle)
Initial IPv6 support developed independently

pf.c is one of the largest .c files in OpenBSD, however:
It continues to be relatively easy to add new features
Bugs are fixed quickly, often with hours of being reported

This is maintainable code
