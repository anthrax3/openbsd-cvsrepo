Future Work

Better TCP ISN and Timestamp generators to combat tuple reuse
Probably something based on RFC1948, but with the ability to re-key

Implementing PAWS checks in the TCP stack as in PF
Looking at tracking least-recently-used ephemeral source ports
selecting ephemeral ports randomly from those	
Looking at exposing the PF state table elsewhere in the kernel
src ports only need to be unique for (dst ip, dst port, src ip) tuple
