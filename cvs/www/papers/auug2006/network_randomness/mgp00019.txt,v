OpenBSD Implementation

Random Number System
Kernel:
TCP ISN
TCP Timestamp
Ephemeral Source Port
IPID, IPv6 Fragment ID
Userland:
BIND
Time Protocols
Obviously, we're ignoring pseudo-randomness we inject for explicitly
cryptographic reasons in IPSec, ssh, carp, etc.

In accordance with OpenBSD's "No useless buttons" policy, we turn these on by default. Actually, there is usually no way to turn them off - it's totally transparent to the user.
