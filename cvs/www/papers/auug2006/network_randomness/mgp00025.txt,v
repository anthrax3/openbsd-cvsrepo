@OpenBSD Implementation
Ephemeral Source Port

Constraints
Should not repeat too soon when other parts of the connection tuple are the same

arc4random() selects the starting point in the available range, then search linearly for an available port

There is a problem here however... As the number of active connections
increases:
The pool of available ports decreases
The selections tend to cluster
