About the PF state table

State entries contain 
Connection identifier (af, src ip, dst ip, src port, dst port)
Connection Tracking
Actions
Links to other internal structures

Indexed in red-black trees
Used to be more like a forest:
A RB tree for interface, interface group, and "floating" states.
"floating" is the default, but searching needs to happen from most specific to least specific.
So basically 3 tree searches per state lookup
