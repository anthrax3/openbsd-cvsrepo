What's Next

A couple more performance optimisations
Linking of route-table entries to states
Work on Congestion handling has moved lower in the network stack (drop packets earlier)

Hopefully, a period of stabilisation and polishing
3000 line diffs are not fun for anyone

Documentation of PF internals
It is now impossible to plan core PF changes without some version of the state-linking diagram
