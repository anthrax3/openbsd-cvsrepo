pf.conf Syntax

Theo is trying to relax some of the rules of the syntax:
Ordering of keywords
braces "{ }" in lists of hosts: The macro expansion nightmare

    windows_hosts = "{" $host1 $host2 "}"
    broken_hosts = "{" $host3 $host4 "}"
    block in quick from any to $windows_hosts $broken_hosts

2.5 hackathons spent failing to fix this
Hostnames are converted to IP addresses at the wrong point in the parser stack
IPv6 makes this about 6 times as hard
