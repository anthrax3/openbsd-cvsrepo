Passing data to from input to output path

The struct pkthdr_pf appears directly in struct mbuf_hdr:

struct pkthdr_pf {
        void        *hdr;           /* saved hdr pos in mbuf for ECN */
        u_int        rtableid;      /* alternate routing table id */
        u_int32_t    qid;           /* queue id */
        u_int16_t    tag;           /* tag id */
        u_int8_t     flags;
        u_int8_t     routed;
};

Small amount of data, huge performance improvement vs using mbuf tags.
In the reald world, packets come on mbuf clusters, so this space in the header is usually unused anyways.
