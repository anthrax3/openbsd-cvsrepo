Introduction to SSH


SSH replaces rlogin, rsh and telnet

Almost completely compatible with rlogin and rsh

Authentication and the resulting session are encrypted to prevent traffic "sniffing"

Many additional features above legacy protocols
Simple public key authentication
Port-forwarding
X11 forwarding
Authentication of server (mitigate MITM attacks)
File transfer
