SSH Protocol v.1 protocol start (step 4)


Client responds with CMSG_SESSION_KEY, containing:
Selected cipher
Protocol flags
256-bit random session key
Encrypted with both server keys
First 128 bits are XORed with session id

The server should have calculated the same session-id in step 3 as the client, it should be able to decrypt the session key
