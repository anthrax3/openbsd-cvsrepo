Capsicum


More than 5 years old

capabilities-on-file-descriptors

Comes from academics

Future plans for capsicum-on-Linux are a flop; developers cannot
even agree on file descriptor semantics

Capsicum understands the "DNS problem", but handles it poorly

Only been used in 12 programs.

Requires intense modification of existing programs




Fails three of my tests: "ease of use", "applicability" and
"use could be mandatory"
