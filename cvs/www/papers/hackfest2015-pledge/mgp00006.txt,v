Ecosystem Adoption


Mitigation mechanisms must not have "false positives".

All applications must be repaired before adoption becomes possible.

People mocked W^X - now the terminology is becoming mainstream...

Some people still mock priv-sep, but not for long ...

Adoption takes 5+ years.

Requires patience.
