Let's look at simple programs first


All programs are a superset of the following:

        main()
        {
                initialization();

                main_loop();
        }

general observations from comparing this to 500 programs in OpenBSD:

- rich set of system calls needed during initialization()

- main_loop() calls narrower class of system calls
