About OpenBSD


A 'whole-system' development approach

A research operating system that stays in the POSIX family

Disruptive innovation is encouraged

If a programming interface is causing trouble
- consider engineering a tweak, extension, replacement, ..
- apply use of that new principle throughout the entire system
- learn from the experience, and if needed, change it
  (or tweak the guts of unix...)

High-level requirements cause the invention of low-level features
Low-level features ease creation of better high-level software

This is the story of a new idea - pledge()...


- formerly known as tame()
