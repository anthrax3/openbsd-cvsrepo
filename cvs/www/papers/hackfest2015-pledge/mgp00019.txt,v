DNS, YP, syslog, and sockets oh my


Inside, all of the above are built up using the socket API

BUT NOT IN OPENBSD ANYMORE!

syslog(3) - always available in pledged programs
uses sendsyslog(2), no socket, no fd

DNS - pledge "dns"
ok uses socket(2) API, but with SOCK_DNS flag

YP - pledge "getpw"
work in progress :)
