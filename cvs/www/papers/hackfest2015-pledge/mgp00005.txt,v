Optional Security is irrelevant!


Mitigation technologies which can be disabled --> fade into history

Seen so many I can't even list them

They come and go

Always come with a knob to "disable the security" when software
fails to work

Software fails --> People turn it off.  They turn it off too far.



I don't work on optional security mechanisms.
