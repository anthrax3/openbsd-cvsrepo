Size of code


pledge() implementation is only 1400 lines of kernel code

Most programs can use pledge() with 3-10 lines of change

400+ converted to pledge() in 6 months

example: xterm pledged by a developer in one evening


Serious programmers can re-hoist their programs to use pledge() in
more sophisticated ways


comprehensive applicability ~= mandatory mitigation
