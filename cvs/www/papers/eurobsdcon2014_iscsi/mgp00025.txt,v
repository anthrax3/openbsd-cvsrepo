Integration - Startup

iscsid(8) can only provide non-boot disks
needs running network
needs running userland
at least init and rc must run
/ and /usr need to be mounted

Still fsck(8) and mount(8) need to reliably
check and mount iscsid(8) provided filesystems
even after an unclean shutdown

Currently not a goal to boot of iscsi drives
use local disk or NFS to boot the root filesystem
