@Firewall Redundancy
pfsync

Each firewall sends out state changes via multicast
Inserts
Updates
Deletes
States have a unique id
Incrementing counter and host id
Best effort
Systems tend towards complete synchronisation
Mechanisms to limit bandwidth/packets
Updates contain only changing state information
Multiple updates are merged into one
