New stuff in 4.2

Important bgpd changes

Include support for Four-octet AS Number Space (RFC4893)
one of the first project to support if officially
internally everything uses 4-octet AS numbers
off by default (unless one of the peers uses 4-octet AS)

Filtering on IPv6 prefixes is now possible

Various bugs in the encoding of multiprotocol updates were fixed
Seems like nobody used IPv6 till lately
