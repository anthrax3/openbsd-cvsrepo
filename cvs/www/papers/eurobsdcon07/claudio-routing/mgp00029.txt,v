Future - RTM_VERSION bump

Bump RTM_VERSION to 4
modify all routing messages
64bit counters all over the place instead of u_long
include routing table id in interface messages
include routing priority in rt_msghdr
source code compatible with old messages
minimal support for old binary format

Already part of -current

minor fallout happened
rtsock.c is a dark dungeon
bad magic and dragons hide in there
OpenVPN stupidity
unable to #include <net/route.h>
