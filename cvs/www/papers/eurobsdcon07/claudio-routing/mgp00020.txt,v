carp(4) and ospfd

possible configuration

 # global configuration
 router-id 0.0.0.2
 
 # areas
 area 0.0.0.0 {
 	auth-type crypt
 	auth-md 1 "L&Y6)@@Vc(6I4=Gq"
 	auth-md 2 "IsJ_-LE:al17a"
 	auth-md-keyid 1
 
 	# main link
 	interface fxp1 { demote carp }
 	# announce local LAN via carp
 	interface carp0
 }


That's the full ospfd config!
