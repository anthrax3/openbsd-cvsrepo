Future - bgpd

Fix mrt dump output
broken since we added 4-octet AS number support

make use of routing priorities

BGP Extended Communities Attribute (RFC4360)

Graceful Restart Mechanism for BGP (RFC4724)
could use graceful restart to do seamless carp failover
unsure if it should be generally supported

BGP/MPLS IP Virtual Private Networks (RFC4364)
at least support in the RIB
use bgpd as route reflector or monitor
