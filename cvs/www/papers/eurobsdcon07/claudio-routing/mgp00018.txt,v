carp(4) and ospfd

ospfd will honour the state of the carp(4) interface
Only the router that is carp master will announce the network

Use per interface demote group to preempt the carp(4) interface

"redistribute connected" with carp(4) often fails
network is attached to the parent interface
not the carp(4) state is tracked, instead the parent one is
carp(4) with unnumbered parent interface behaves strange
redistribution fails on startup

Use "interface carp0" that works
