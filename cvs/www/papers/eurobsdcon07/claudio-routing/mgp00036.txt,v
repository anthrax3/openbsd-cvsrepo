Future - MPLS

VRF needs a generic tunnelling protocol
commercial systems use either MPLS or L2TP

Implementation based on ayame (www.ayame.org)

Label distribution require special "routing" daemons
start with static configuration
yet another bgpd/ospfd child?

Implement a MPLS tunnel interface
instead of ip_input()/ip_output() hacks
logic can be reused for L2TP
