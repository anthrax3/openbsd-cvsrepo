Stuff to do

Routing socket filters
many tools in userland are only interested in interface state changes
bgpd produces an insane amount of messages
dhclient uses 10-30% CPU time if bgpd couples its FIB

Cleanup the mbuf API madness
create a secure alternative to the current madness
at the moment way to many side effects cause crashes
cleanup code, especially incoming path

Replace patricia tree with a more performing alternative
original patricia tree was developed for a VAX
current CPU work differently, memory access is expensive
