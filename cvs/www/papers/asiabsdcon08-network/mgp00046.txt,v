Routing Priorities - Incentive

routing daemons need to keep their tables in sync

different preference (priority) in case of conflicts
OSPF is preferred over BGP

synchronization in userland is difficult
race conditions
all daemons must obey a global policy
routing socket is lossy!

a better solution is needed
