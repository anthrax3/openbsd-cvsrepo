Network Layer - Input

Netisr calls network service routine
only if data is pending

Incoming pf(4) filtering

Is the destination not local?
forward if enabled else drop
adjust packet (TTL, checksum)
pass to output routine

Pass further to next layer
use protosw / inetsw[] structure
every protocol fills a protosw structure
a bit like objects in OO programming
