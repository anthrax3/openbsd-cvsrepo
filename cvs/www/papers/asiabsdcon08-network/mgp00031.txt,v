Route Labels

route can be tagged with a generic label

label is replaced with an integer in the kernel
instead of storing and comparing strings
faster & memory efficient

special name to id lookup table in the kernel
reference counting necessary
currently a slow linear lookup
lookups only needed on addition of routes or pf rules
