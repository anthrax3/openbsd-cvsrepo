Routing Domains

extended version of multiple routing tables

bind interfaces to a specific table
same network can be defined multiple times
store link layer addresses in that table
arp code needs to be modified
tag packets on reception
already done
use the pkthdr ifp pointer

routing socket marks messages with the various tables ids
new routing messages needed
userland must filter by itself
