Deployment on OpenBSD

GPRS and UMTS devices act like serial devices, so we use them like a regular modem

AT commands are used to talk to the device, as such we use ppp(8) or pppd(8) to establish connections

To play around use tip(1), cu(1)

The GPRS / UMTS logic is hidden in the device, we never have to deal with it

Each vendor, of course, uses a different subset of AT commands

currently we only support the Modem-Port on all of the devices. Basically all devices have a way of polling the status of the device in order to get informations about the signal strength
