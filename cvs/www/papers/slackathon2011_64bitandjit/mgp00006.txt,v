64 bit and jit

Obvious solution: just allocate all (1GB) jit memory in advance!

Memory use is much less, so resident size not that high.
Who uses ulimit anyway?

FAIL: sane OS has ulimit datalimit < 1GB

(ulimit datalimit is a nice way
of keeping programs from going berserk
on memory allocations)
