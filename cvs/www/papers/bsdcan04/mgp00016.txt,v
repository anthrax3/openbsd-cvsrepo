Randomized malloc()


Sample situation:

p = malloc(16);
free(p);
p2 = malloc(16);
if (p != p2)
        Excellent!

Two types of objects are managed by  malloc() :

Smaller than a page

  malloc() maintains buckets of "chunks"
Randomize chunk selection out of bucket
Enabled using malloc.conf 'G' option

Equal or greater than a page:

Use randomized mmap()
Unfinished ...


Still fairly expensive.  Not being enabled until we can make it cheap
