Summary


Cheap
(performance measurement graphs are beyond the scope of this talk :)

Almost universal
Some things work on all cpus
Complete coverage on good cpus (hacks for weak ones)

No violation of POSIX semantics
All programs continue working fine

Go tell other operating system vendors you expect them to make
at least a few of these changes..
