Even after huge efforts to increase software quality, bugs
will remain.


The clever attacker understands the unintended side-effects
created by a bug, as well as the system environment the code
lives in, and crafts an exploit which grants him advantage.
It is high time for defensive technologies which make it harder
to write an exploit.  Recent and upcoming developments in
OpenBSD make the environment which processes live in much
more hostile towards exploitation, without impacting
well-behaving processes.
