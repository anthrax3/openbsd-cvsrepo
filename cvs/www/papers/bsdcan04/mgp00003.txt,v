Our Goal


Unix programs run in a "POSIX environment"

POSIX specifies three things:

Things we cannot (should not) change in Unix
Things we can change in Unix
Things which are... left as undefined

But there are also other standards, and "defacto" behaviours ...
we must be careful

Our goals:

1. Do not break the behaviours that programs expect
2. DO NOT BREAK THE BEHAVIOURS THAT PROGRAMS DEPEND ON
3. Change anything else which makes an exploit author cry

What follows is a list of such mechanisms...
