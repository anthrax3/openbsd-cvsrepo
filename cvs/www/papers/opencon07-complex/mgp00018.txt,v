Software interfaces: C99


Macro format strings?!?
typedef_is_evil_t
makes the preprocessor more twisted
long doubles/hex floats
Variable Length Arrays/sizeof mess
unsigned to signed 'promoted' types in some cases...
Multi byte character encodings (including source files)
makes it harder to write a C compiler
makes it harder to write static analysis tools
