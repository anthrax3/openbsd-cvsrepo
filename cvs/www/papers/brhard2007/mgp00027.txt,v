How can you help with the hardware vendors?


If you think it will make a difference, don't buy hardware 
from these predatory players

But most importantly -- when any group issues a call to mail
employees at companies about these issues PLEASE JOIN IN!

Be polite
Be detailed
Help us when we attack a specific vendor
Don't confuse by asking for "vendor support"
Don't confuse by asking for "vendor source code"
Simply ask for "programming documentation"
and .. ask for a personal reply.

It does not work everytime.  But it has worked often enough.
