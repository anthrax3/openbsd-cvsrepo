Vendor reasons and excuses: the bullshit


The FCC / "Software Defined Radio" excuse:
"The FCC sets limits on what devices such as these can do,
so we cannot give you documentation or you may modify it
to go out of the frequency"

The FCC (or any equiv organization) has never attacked an open vendor

The radios cannot go that far out of range
The radios cannot generate enough power to be a risk

But the best part:  These chips require firmware upload, so we could
already modify the firmware or the driver

This is an excuse ... but not from the vendors ... from the users
