Why should you care?


Most of our users have already purchased the machine

Products should be "suitable" for the intented purpose

There is a gap in the enforcement of this principle

Most other industries are required to provide "repair information"
(see recent rulings in US/EU about car repair manuals)

Without documentation, developers often make mistakes
writing drivers

Even in the worst case:
Attempts (and partial successes) at making any operating system
run on hardware puts pressure on commercial software vendors
(Microsoft) to not screw the customer as much.
