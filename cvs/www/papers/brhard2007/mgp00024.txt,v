Where does Linux fit in?


"If you are not part of the solution, you are
part of the problem"

Many Linux vendors/developers are part of the problem:

Signing NDAs for documentation
Acceptance of blobs ("binary drivers")
Accepting source-code drivers from vendors -- without
documentation (source code is not documentation)

Result? Unmaintainable drivers. (What is the value of
freedom, if the driver is too buggy)

This makes it much harder for the other projects
