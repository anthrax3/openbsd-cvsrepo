More Address Space Tweaks: in ld.so


We just spent some time in ld.so modifying how it maps
libraries... so..

Randomize the shared library order

Map shared libraries in a different order every time
Matters more for programs using many libraries: 
                sshd, mozilla, lots of other gigantic junk..

Randomized the addresses for the shared libraries

We know how large pre-configured libraries are
Attempt to map them randomly into the address
    space by skewing their base addresses
Waste a wee bit of virtual address space
