The clever attacker

finds a bug

understands the unintended side-effects created

because of the strict regularity of the system environment

... and crafts an exploit which grants him advantage.

It is high time for defensive technologies which make it
harder to write an exploit.  Ongoing developments in OpenBSD
focus on making the system environment much more hostile
towards exploitation, without impacting well-behaving processes.
