W^X Transition (6 of 6): Without per-page X




A simpler view...

In each object the
"data" section starts
512MB after the "code"
section.

Kernel loads main program
and ld.so into memory

ld.so packs objects
like libc into the address
space, making them fit

"overlapping the gaps"

Insane but effective.
