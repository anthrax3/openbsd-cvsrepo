Other issues: Unavoidable breakage.. or not?


Some database records must change to 64-bit (big breaks)

Some must remain 32-bit

careful handling -- some can become unsigned 32-bit

So some protocols are good to 2106

NFSv2 -- unsigned 32
pcap -- unsigned 32 (but we did that before)
ping, traceroute etc
