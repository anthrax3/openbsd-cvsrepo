Alternative: Change nothing


OK, so it is hard.  Should we change nothing?


"Status quo can also refer to a situation that stakeholders find
mutually undesirable but the outcome of any changes to it may be
overly risky; at the same time they recognize that eventual change
will occur, and openness to the potential that a better alternative
solution may emerge over time."   -- Wikipedia


In this case, "eventual change" may occur just before 2038 (with
a lot of panic)

If someone does not take the step, noone takes the step.
