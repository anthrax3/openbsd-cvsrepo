Compare to strlcpy / strlcat


Permit a digression...

Ulrich Drepper has wrong-footed the entire software ecosystem

Primary criteria for strlcpy/strlcat was ease of audit / code repair

If you can't use strlcpy/strlcat correctly, all the other methods
are more complex / error prone

Recognize that only skilled auditors can skillfully audit / repair code

By not providing a clear and simple method for improvement, much
code simply WILL NOT BE repaired/improved...

New critical code?  Will use other techniques.
Old pre-existing code?  Won't be fixed.
