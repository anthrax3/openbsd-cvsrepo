Specific Examples (privsep and privdrop)


First priv-sep program was postfix (not our project)
Second priv-sep program was OpenSSH (our project)

(Some programs can entirely priv-drop if slightly rewritten)

Today?

  ping ping6 pflogd isakmpd iked dhclient systrace aucat ssh sshd
  authpf bgpd dhcpd dhcrelay dvmrpd ftp-proxy hostapd identd iscsid
  ldapd ldpd mrinfo mtrace nsd (taught them) ntpd ospf6d ospfd
  popa3d portmap rbootd relayd ripd rtadvd sasyncd slowcgi smtpd
  spamd spamlogd tcpdump tftp-proxy tftpd traceroute traceroute6
  ypldap

If an OpenBSD developer writes a daemon which doesn't use this
technique they'd be laughed straight into another project...
