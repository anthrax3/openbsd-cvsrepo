Simple instructions for conversions


Emphasis: handle "long long", but do not break other systems

remove time_t from network/on-disk/database formats: use
long long (use "u_int32_t" if best we can do is gain +68 years)

remove as many (time_t) casts as possible
(casting to indeterminate size standard types is poisonous)

"print" values using %lld and (long long) casts

Be very careful around timeval.tv_sec and timespec.tv_sec
(Convert timeval to timespec where possible)

Would love better compiler tools -- none found so far, except removing
(time_t) casts
