off_t: Industry response -- Large File Summit (LFS)


That document contains 74 uses of the words "transition"
or "transitional"

How/when do we transition away from needing
-D_LARGEFILE_SOURCE?

Has any system transitioned over it "by default"?

Ever used errno EOVERFLOW?

Backwards compatibility wins, simplicity loses
