OpenNTPD - Design Goals


security
very tight validity checks in the network input path
all buffer operations bounded and/or properly guarded
privilege seperation

ease of use
lean implementation, sufficient for a majority
no overloaded feature monster
should "just work" in the background
should reach reasonable accuracy
we're not after the last microseconds
should only require a minimum of configuration

performance, of course!
