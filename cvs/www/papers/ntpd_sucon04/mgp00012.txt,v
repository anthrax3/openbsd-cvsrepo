Implementation: Client side


On startup, we send a query every 5 seconds

The longer we run, the better our view of time gets

The smaller the offset gets, the lesser we have to call adjtime()

Scale the query frequency based on
wether we treat peer as valid or not - if we don't, we want to query it more often to restore trust quickly
the believed offset of the local clock - with bigger offset it needs to corrected more often, obviously
