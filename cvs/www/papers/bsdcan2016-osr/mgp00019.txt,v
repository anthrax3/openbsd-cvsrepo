BGP route selection and propagation

routes received from external BGP peers are subjected to route selection
best routes are sent on to all internal BGP peers
routes received from iBGP peers are subjected to route selection
but only sent to external BGP peers if filters allow it

see bgpd(8) for the route decision process steps.
