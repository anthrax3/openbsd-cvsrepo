BGP: announcements


to the outside an AS announces the routes (called prefixes) that are reachable through it

what you announce is a matter of policy:
your AS is only announcing its own prefixes
your AS is announcing its own and your customers prefixes
your AS is announcing to someone the whole internet routing table, this is called "giving someone transit"

what you announce influences your incoming traffic
optimize for cost
optimize for reachability
