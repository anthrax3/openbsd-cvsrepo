BGP


is a distance vector protocol
uses tcp connections, called sessions

an entity using BGP to connect to other entities is called an autonomous system (AS)

all BGP routers in an AS have a session to each other (but see later)

a router sends route UPDATE messages
shares its routing table with its neighbors
