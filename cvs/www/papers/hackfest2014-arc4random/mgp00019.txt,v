kernel random subsystem


- bootblocks read root:/etc/random.seed
- mix with RDRAND (or other clock source) information
- Passes data to kernel as an ELF segment

- kernel always collects entropy from interrupt sources or
  random devices in the normal fashion, and mixes in

- rc scripts create new /etc/random.seed file

- shutdown scripts (also) create new /etc/random.seed file

- Additional file: /var/db/host.random
