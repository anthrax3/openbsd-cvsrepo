The libc DNS resolver ID issue


A 16-bit ID in the packet...

ID started at 1, and incremented: ID++


We should use use random numbers, but this is in libc

opening /dev/random per DNS packet is silly
keeping a file descriptor open is unworkable
and what if there are no file descriptors left?

(Furthermore, the numbers should be be random, but slightly
non-repeating...)
