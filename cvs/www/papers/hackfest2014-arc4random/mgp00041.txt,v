Linux?


We have encouraged Ted Ts'o to create a getentropy-like interface
for Linux; getrandom()

Too many options, too easy to misuse

Interactions with signal handlers (EINTR)

Hope applications do not directly call getrandom()...


Bit worrying

Really feels like there is pressure against easy-access random..

"Use /dev/random" meme continues damaging effects
