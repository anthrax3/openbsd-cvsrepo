"Noone should invent their own crypto, use OpenSSL"


    "The next generation awesome random subsystem must be
    super, super secure, before we change 1 line of code
    to rely on it"

result -> nothing changes.  20 years of stagnancy.

If you try to create your own random layer, the crypto forums
attack you

Reality:
- Focusing only on key/IV quality leaves lots of problems
  unsolved
- There are many very different use cases for random data.
- There are many problematic calling contexts

Imagine if random numbers were as cheap as memset()...
