OpenBSD


A 'whole-system' development approach

Binary backwards-compatibility is a rejected concept

A true research operating system that stays in the POSIX family

If a programming interface is causing trouble
- consider engineering a tweak, semantic extension, replacement, ..
- apply use of that new principle throughout the entire system
- learn from the experience, and if needed, change it

High-level requirements cause the invention of low-level features
Low-level features ease creation of better high-level software


This is the story of one low-level feature - arc4random().
