@Taking over the world

dpb can now reach out and build xenocara
normal xenocara build
benefits since so many configures
can distribute over a cluster
just need inter-dependencies
no more waiting

dpb will reach out to build source
dependencies are trivial
only part left out will be initial kernel
release can occur very late
