Business & Engineering


Big & US companies focus on "speed of development", time to market
To satisfy the OEM race (more on that later)

Smaller or foreign companies focus on "the right product, at the
right price"

In non-aligned / non-integrated markets (ie. usb ethernet dongle)
the US vendors are being trashed

In aligned / integrated markets (chipset with product built in)
the foreign companies can barely compete (except VIA)

Examples:
Realtek 90% of entire ethernet chip market... but
Intel & Broadcom & Marvell 50% of ethernet chips on motherboards
