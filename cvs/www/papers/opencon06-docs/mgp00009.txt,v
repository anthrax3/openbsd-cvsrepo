The hardware: clocks, serial


Full support.

clocks                  100%
serial                   100%

These are very important devices for developers

Most clock, nvram, or serial chips are standard off-the-shelf parts

Documentation is fully open for 100% of these chips -- just use
google to find the pdf files

Same for i2c sensors, and lots of other minor machine goo
