The hardware: and... busses


Sometimes the busses matter too....

ISA                                    open
PCI, MiniPCI & family       open
Cardbus & PCMCIA           open
USB                                    open

ExpressCard                      semi-open
SD & SDIO                        closed

The SD Association only gives out documentation under NDA.

But they cannot stop us.  It is almost all figured out now...
SD works.. and SDIO is close ;)
