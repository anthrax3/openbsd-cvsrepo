Why should you care?


Most of our users have already purchased the machine

Products should be "suitable" for the intented purpose

There is a gap in the enforcement of this principle

Most other industries are required to provide "repair information"
(see recent rulings about car repair manuals)

Without documentation, developers often make mistakes
writing drivers

Even in the worst case:
Attempts (and partial successes) at making any operating system
run on hardware puts pressure on commercial software vendors
(Microsoft) to not screw the customer as much.
