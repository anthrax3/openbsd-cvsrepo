How can you help?


If you think it will make a difference, don't buy hardware from
these predatory players

But most importantly -- when any group issues a call to mail
employees at companies about these issues PLEASE JOIN IN!

Be polite
Be detailed
Don't stray from our requests
Don't confuse by asking for "vendor support"
Don't confuse by asking for "vendor source code"
Simply ask for "programming documentation"
and .. ask for a personal reply.

It does not work everytime.  But it has worked often enough.
