Why do we need documentation?


This should be a "No brainer", but many people often
forget some reasons

Problem is that our user base thinks that our efforts are "for them"
No!  Our user base just benefit from our efforts!

This is a developer culture -- not a user culture -- sorry!
Just like Linux is a developer culture
But.. note that Red Hat is more of a money culture

Developers hack for the "oh my god I got it to work" rush

Without docs, the rush is harder to achieve, and some
developers just give up

Noone wants developers to give up.
