Vendor reasons and excuses


How do vendors behave?

1. Vendor does not even reply.  TI, Connexant, SiS, Broadcom
2. Vendor stalemates process in never-ending dialogue
3. Vendor gives bullshit reasons
4. Vendor asks for NDA to be signed (becoming more rare)
5. Vendor releases documentation upon request
6. Vendor already had documentation up, and shows us where

Our actions

1. Tell our community who to complain to at vendor
2. Tell our community who to complain to at vendor
3. Tell our community who to complain to at vendor
4. Attempt "gentleman's agreement", otherwise... see above
5. Thank vendor
6. Thank vendor
