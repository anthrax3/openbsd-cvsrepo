Signal Handlers - exit()


exit runs atexit handlers

sure all the atexit structures are in a consistent state when your signal handlers run?

are all registered atexit handlers signal handler safe? likely not...

_exit() is safe, but then atexit handlers don't run and stdio is not flushed - get clear about the consequences
