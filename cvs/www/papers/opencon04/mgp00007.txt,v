Signal Handlers - malloc


malloc uses incredibly complicated data structures internally to keep track of the allocations. without locking.

singal while main program is deep in malloc(): half-recorded allocation, signal handler malloc()s too, return to main program

malloc internally now has a half wrong recording of the allocation it is about to give out
