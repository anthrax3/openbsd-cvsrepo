Signal Handlers


Signals are used to notify a program of some event in Unix
SIGTERM asks a program to shut down and exit
SIGCHLD tells a program that a child process changed state
on most unix: 31 signals defined

Programs can install signal handlers to catch them and react
exception: SIGKILL is not catchable

There is a default action for each signal
