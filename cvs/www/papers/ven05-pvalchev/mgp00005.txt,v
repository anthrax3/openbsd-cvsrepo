Since it was mentioned yesterday, let's have a slide for it.

Some pvalchev guy spent a lot of time on it... why?  200-300 patches now.

many stupid bugs fixed, amazing it works on linux (as usual, by luck)

an example so you get an idea... spent many hours on this, bug found by our random malloc (Espie helped me debug)
