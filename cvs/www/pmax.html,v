OpenBSD/pmax used to run on a large set of the Digital MIPS-based DECstation and
DECserver family. These machines were the counterpart of the <a

<a name="history"></a>
<h3><font color="#0000e0"><strong>History:</strong></font></h3>

<p>
The pmax port of OpenBSD was started by Thomas Graichen shortly before the
OpenBSD 2.0 release, based on the NetBSD/pmax sources. It was then slowly
brought in shape, becoming self-hosted, and moving to ECOFF, then ELF
binaries.
</p>

<p>
A few releases later, Thomas Graichen stopped working on this port, and
nobody stepped in. The port was slowly left in oblivion, with no new code and
hardly any bugfixes, although releases were still being made.
</p>

<p>
A timid effort was made after the 2.7 release to revive the port, but
MIPS-specific toolchain problems prevented the system from building itself for a
long time, and development went on hiatus again. When the problem was finally
fixed, it was decided however to stop supporting it and remove the code from the
tree.

<P>The pmax port of OpenBSD was started by Thomas Graichen (<A
HREF="mailto:graichen@@openbsd.org">graichen@@OpenBSD.org</A>) shortly
before the OpenBSD 2.0 release.  It is currently without a maintainer.
If you would like to maintain the port, hardware is available so please
send <A HREF="mailto:millert@@openbsd.org">mail</A>.
From the pmax specific code it is heavily based on NetBSD/pmax. 
I want to take the chance
here to say thanks to Dieter Mayer and Rob Urban for supplying me (Thomas) with
the hardware to do the development on. Also i want to thank all the people
from the NetBSD/pmax team and mailing lists especially Jonathan Stone
and Michael Hitch for their help in many situations.
If you are interested in getting OpenBSD/pmax you can either use the latest
formal release of OpenBSD or one of the snapshots of OpenBSD/pmax if you
are interested in tracking the current state - you may get them both from
<A HREF="ftp.html">the usual OpenBSD ftp servers</A>.</P>
d64 5
a68 4
<P>Despite of the fact that the hardware specific code in OpenBSD/pmax
doesn't differ much from NetBSD/pmax,
you get all the usual OpenBSD improvements, additions and fixes - most
important here are the security related stuff and fixes.

<FONT COLOR=#00c000>
We are looking for someone with some time and interest in helping
with the development of OpenBSD/pmax who also has some skills for
doing this. Dieter Mayer from Open System Solutions in Munich
(germany) will provide a complete machine for free for this task.
Someone from germany would be prefered due to the transport of that
machine and if this person comes from the area around munich there's
also the possibility to couple the hacking with some payed system
administration at Open System Solutions.
<P>
We are thinking about:
<UL>
<LI>
  bringing the old style scsi subsystem over to the new generic scsi
  framework used by the other architectures 
</LI>
<LI>
  integration of an Xws (used by X11R6 or newer xservers) compatible
  interface to the console/framebuffer (some ideas for that are
  already available from Dieter Mayer)
</LI>
<LI>
  helping in merging over good stuff from NetBSD/pmax
</LI>
<LI>
  general development on the pmax (often building and veryfying that
  everything work on the pmax)

<H3><B>History and status:</B></H3>

<P>The pmax port of OpenBSD is being worked on by Thomas Graichen (<A HREF="mailto:graichen@@openbsd.org">graichen@@OpenBSD.org</A>).
From the pmax specific code it is heavily based on NetBSD/pmax. I usually
try to keep it in sync with all fixes and improvements from NetBSD/pmax.
Starting with the 2.1 release of OpenBSD the pmax port is now no longer
only available in form of snapshots but i still plan to make new snapshots
of the current state of OpenBSD/pmax from time to time available. So far
it is running very stable for me and is also reported to do so from a lot
of other people on different kinds of machines. I want to take the chance
here to say thanks to Dieter Mayer and Rob Urban for supplying me with
a42 4
<P>I'm very interested in getting feedback from people running OpenBSD/pmax
on their machines ... so if you do so - please send me a mail about it
... this way i can get a feeling of how many people are using it - thanks.</P>

some problems with the serial ports in some situations and also with
some framebuffers which are partially fixed in the current tree
(mostly fixes merged in from NetBSD/pmax). Send me (<A

<h2>OpenBSD/pmax</h2>

<hr>
<h3><strong>History and Status:</strong></h3>

<p>
The pmax port of OpenBSD is being worked on by Thomas Graichen (<a
href=mailto:graichen@@openbsd.org>graichen@@openbsd.org</a>). The status
is that i have it so far running now (a lot of thanks to Dieter Mayer
who made all this possible by sending me a Decstaion 5000/200 -
thanks) and i have also started to create snapshots of OpenBSD/pmax
and X11 for OpenBSD/pmax from time to
time - you may get them from 
<a href=ftp.html>the usual OpenBSD ftp servers</a>.
</p>

<h3><strong>Differences to NetBSD/pmax:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>we have native shared libraries
<li>the port is self-hosting (i.e. it only uses in-tree tools - there is
no need for externel binutils).
<li>i try too keep the release of snapshots and releases close to
releasing X11 binaries too (X11R5 servers and X11R6 clients - both
compiled with ProjectRoot /usr/X11R6)
<li>you get all the usual OpenBSD improvements, additions and fixes
</ul>

</p>
Aside from that the hardware support is nearly identical to NetBSD/pmax.
</p>

</p>
This is also the place there i plan to put all hints for the installation
and fixes for problems while doing it to.

The pmax port has no architecture specific changes from the
NetBSD/pmax port.
It is being worked on by Thomas Graichen (<a href=mailto:graichen@@openbsd.org>graichen@@openbsd.org</a>). If you are interested in getting involved or want to know more about the status send him a mail.
