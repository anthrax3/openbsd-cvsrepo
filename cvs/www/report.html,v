<h3><font color="#0000e0">Released versions problem reports</font></h3>

Before reporting bugs/problems with released versions, go through this
checklist:

<ol>
 <li>First, check for <a href="errata.html">patches and notes regarding the
     release</a>.
 <li>Next, find out if there is a <a href="orders.html">newer release</a>
     available.
 <li>Finally, check for <a href="plus.html">changes made between OpenBSD
     versions</a>.
</ol>

<p>
If nothing looks like it addresses your problem, then please become acquainted
with <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/sendbug">sendbug(1)</a> before submitting
a bug report.

<h3><font color="#0000e0">Current version problem reports</font></h3>

If your problem is with the <i>-current</i> source tree rather than
<i>-release</i> or <i>-stable</i>, 

<ol>
 <li>Test the problem at least twice, with source updated a few days apart.
 <li>Do not report source tree compilation problems, unless they persist.
     They are almost always your mistake, or they are being worked on as you
     encounter them.
     People working on the project are doing
     <a href="faq/faq5.html">make build</a> at least once per day, and usually
     several times per day with different architectures.
 <li>Remember that the <a href="anoncvs.html">AnonCVS</a> servers are
     updated a few hours behind the actual working source tree.
 <li>Check for <a href="plus.html">changes made between OpenBSD versions</a>
     to see if the problem has been addressed.
 <li>Much care is made in creating snapshots.
     Sometimes mistakes are made, and our apologies are extended.
     Reading or writing to the mailing lists is more appropriate than sending
     in a bug report.
</ol>

<h3><font color="#0000e0">How to create a problem report</font></h3>

<b>Always provide as much information as possible</b>.
Try to pinpoint the exact problem.
Give clear instructions on how to reproduce the problem.
Try to describe it with as much accuracy and non-confusing terminology
as possible, especially if it is not easy to reproduce.
Describing problems by saying "it crashes" or "I get strange interrupt issues
on this one box that I built" are of no use.
Communicate with others (on the mailing lists or any other forum where
knowledgeable users congregate) to confirm that the problem is new and
preferably repeatable.
Please try to make sure it is not a local problem created by using broken
or unsupported hardware, or by using unsupported build options or software.

<p>
Please don't start fixing problems that require significant work until you
are sure you understand them, especially during our release periods when we
must not change major sections of code.
If you are going to write significant amounts of code, mention it on the
mailing lists to make sure no one else is already working on the problem
(saving duplication of effort).

<p>
The following items should be contained in every bug report:

<ol>
 <li>The exact sequence of steps from startup necessary to reproduce
     the problem.
     This should be self-contained; it is not enough to send in a bare
     command without the arguments and other data you supplied to it.
     If a bug requires a particular sequence of events, please list those. 
     You are encouraged to minimize the size of your example, but this is
     not absolutely necessary.
     If the bug is reproducible, we'll find it either way.
<p>
 <li>The output you got.
     Please do not just say that it "didn't work" or "failed."
     If there is an error message, show it, even if you don't understand it.
     If OpenBSD panics with a particular error, say which.
     If nothing at all happens, say so.
     Even if the result of your test case is a program crash or otherwise
     obvious, it might not happen in our testing.
     The easiest thing is to copy the output from the terminal, if possible.
<p>
     Note: In case of fatal errors, the error message provided might not
     contain all the information available.
     In that case, also look at the output in the system log files, such
     as those stored in /var/log.
     Also, if you are dealing with an application that has its own log files,
     such as httpd, check for errors where it keeps its logs.
<p>
 <li>The OpenBSD kernel output.
     You can get this with the dmesg command, but it is possible that your
     dmesg output does not contain all the information that is captured in
     <tt>/var/run/dmesg.boot</tt>.
     If this is the case, include information from both.
     <b>Please include this in all bug reports.</b>
<p>
 <li>If you run third party software which has to do with your bug, say so,
     including what version.
     If you are talking about a snapshot, mention that, including its date
     and time.
<p>
 <li>A traceback from your kernel panic.
     If your kernel panicked and you are at a
     <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/ddb">ddb(4)</a>
     prompt, please provide the panic message, as well as the output of
     the <tt>trace</tt> and <tt>ps</tt> commands in your bug report as
     advised.
     If the machine hangs, try enabling <tt>sysctl ddb.console=1</tt>
     prior to the hang and getting in DDB via Ctl+Alt+Esc on the keyboard
     (must be outside of X), or sending BREAK if using a serial console.
     If, for some reason, the panic message is not visible, you can get it
     again with the <tt>show panic</tt> command.
     <b>This is essential whenever possible.
     Panic reports without the panic message, traceback and ps output are
     useless</b>.
     The output of <tt>show registers</tt> might be of interest as well.
     You might then want to reboot with <tt>boot dump</tt> so that a kernel
     image could be saved by
     <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/savecore">savecore(8)</a> for further
     post-mortem debugging, as described in the
     <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/crash">crash(8)</a> man page.
<p>
   <li>If you're reporting a problem with the X Window System on an
   architecture that uses the X.Org server, please include the full 
   <tt>/var/log/Xorg.0.log</tt> file in your report in addition
   to the <tt>dmesg.boot</tt> information.
</ol>

<p>
Do not be afraid if your bug report becomes rather lengthy.
That is a fact of life.
It's better to report everything the first time than us having to squeeze
the facts out of you.
On the other hand, if your input files are huge, it is fair to ask first
whether somebody is interested in looking into it.

<h3 id="bugtypes"><font color="#0000e0">Sending in bug reports</font></h3>

If possible, use the <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/sendbug">sendbug(1)</a>
command to help generate your bug report.
It will automatically include some useful information about your hardware
that helps diagnose many issues.
This tool requires that your system can properly send email.
If you cannot use sendbug on a functional OpenBSD machine, please send your
bug report to <a href="mailto:bugs@@openbsd.org">bugs@@openbsd.org</a>.

<p>
Perhaps what you are sending in is a feature request, not necessarily a bug.
New features are accepted, especially with code that implements your suggested
new feature.

<p>
For debugging some problems, we must have the hardware that has the problem.
Please remember that the OpenBSD project's resources are limited.
You could <a href="want.html">donate some hardware</a>.

Do not be afraid if your bug report becomes rather lengthy. That is a fact
of life. It's better to report everything the first time than us having to
squeeze the facts out of you. On the other hand, if your input files are

it.

If possible, use the <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=sendbug&amp;sektion=1&amp;format=html">sendbug(1)</a> command to get the bug into our tracking system.
Sendbug requires that your system can properly send Internet email.  If you 
cannot use sendbug on a functional OpenBSD machine, please send your bug report
to <a href="mailto:bugs@@openbsd.org">bugs@@openbsd.org</a>.

For debugging some problems, we must have the hardware that has the
problem.  Please remember that the OpenBSD project's resources are limited.

Types of bug reports in order of desirability:
<ol>
<li>Repeatable problems with source fixes are the best.
<li>Repeatable problems that are not specific to your hardware/software
     layout.
<li>Repeatable problems specific to your software layout.
<li>Repeatable problems specific to your hardware layout.
<li>Non-repeatable problems -- or problems you do not wish to repeat.

Try to pin-point the exact problem.  Never give vague instructions,
or detail vague problems like "it crashes" or "I get strange interrupt
issues on this one box that I built." Talk to others on IRC or some

it is not a local problem.
