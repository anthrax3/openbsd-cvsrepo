We don't want donations to turn into paid advertising, even when
translated.  Pointed out by Frank Bax.

@Some people of disrepute are sending us smallish donations, but then act
towards us as if these not donations -- by firmly insisting that there is
a deal, that we must we link to some site they are doing business for, which
has a horrid page rank (because it is a bad business, generally).
they are trying to use OpenBSD for advertising purposes. but a donation is
a donation is a donation -- it is not a business transaction where we get
paid to decrease our own page rank and increase theirs!
So add /donations.html to robots.txt.  Hopefully some search engines will
now stop ranking those sites (because some might still be in the file) based
on our file, and these people will realize that they are doing something
totally futile.
