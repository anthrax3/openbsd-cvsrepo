@The complexity and quality of kerberosV and the fact that almost
nobody is using it doesn't justify to have it in base - disable and
remove it.  If the 2 two people who use it still want it, they can
make a port or recompile OpenBSD on their own.

There is a quote in theo.c from August 2010: "basically, dung beetles
fucking.  that's what kerberosV + openssl is like".

Discussed with many.  Tests by henning@@ reyk@@ and others.

     kkrrbb55--ccoonnffiigg tells the application programmer what special flags to use to
     compile and link programs against the libraries installed by Heimdal.

     Options supported:

     ----pprreeffiixx[=_d_i_r]
             Print the prefix if no _d_i_r is specified, otherwise set prefix to
             _d_i_r.

     ----eexxeecc--pprreeffiixx[=_d_i_r]
             Print the exec-prefix if no _d_i_r is specified, otherwise set exec-
             prefix to _d_i_r.

     ----lliibbss  Output the set of libraries that should be linked against.

     ----ccffllaaggss
             Output the set of flags to give to the C compiler when using the
             Heimdal libraries.

     By default kkrrbb55--ccoonnffiigg will output the set of flags and libraries to be
     used by a normal program using the krb5 API.  The user can also supply a
     library to be used, the supported ones are:

     krb5    (the default)

     gssapi  use the krb5 gssapi mechanism

     kadm-client
             use the client-side kadmin libraries

     kadm-server
             use the server-side kadmin libraries

@update kerberosV to Heimdal 1.5.2 using BSD Makefiles based
on the ones from FreeBSD

This is getting commited now so that we can patch it up
fast in the tree.
There are known regressions so please don't try to build
this on your own now, please wait for the next available
snapshot.

If however you would still want to build it, make sure
build and install everything in the tools directory first.

This is not the full commit yet because there are several
subdirectories.

@Import of heimdal-0.3f

Lots of changes, highlights include:

 * change default keytab to ANY:FILE:/etc/krb5.keytab,krb4:/etc/srvtab,
   the new keytab type that tries both of these in order (SRVTAB is
   also an alias for krb4:)

 * improve error reporting and error handling (error messages should
   be more detailed and more useful)

 * the API is closer to what MIT krb5 is using

 * more compatible with windows 2000

 * removed some memory leaks

 * bug fixes
