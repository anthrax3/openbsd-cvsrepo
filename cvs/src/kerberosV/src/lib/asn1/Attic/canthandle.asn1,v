@The complexity and quality of kerberosV and the fact that almost
nobody is using it doesn't justify to have it in base - disable and
remove it.  If the 2 two people who use it still want it, they can
make a port or recompile OpenBSD on their own.

There is a quote in theo.c from August 2010: "basically, dung beetles
fucking.  that's what kerberosV + openssl is like".

Discussed with many.  Tests by henning@@ reyk@@ and others.

CANTHANDLE DEFINITIONS ::= BEGIN

-- Code the tag [1] but not the [ CONTEXT CONS UT_Sequence ] for Kaka2
-- Workaround: use inline the structure directly
-- Code the tag [2] but it should be primitive since KAKA3 is
-- Workaround: use the INTEGER type directly

Kaka2  ::= SEQUENCE {
        kaka2-1 [0] INTEGER
}

Kaka3  ::= INTEGER

Foo ::= SEQUENCE {
        kaka1 [0] IMPLICIT INTEGER OPTIONAL,
        kaka2 [1] IMPLICIT Kaka2 OPTIONAL,
        kaka3 [2] IMPLICIT Kaka3 OPTIONAL
}

-- Don't code kaka if it's 1
-- Workaround is to use OPTIONAL and check for in the encoder stubs

Bar ::= SEQUENCE {
        kaka [0] INTEGER DEFAULT 1
}

--  Can't handle primitives in SET OF
--  Workaround is to define a type that is only an integer and use that

Baz ::= SET OF INTEGER

@update kerberosV to Heimdal 1.5.2 using BSD Makefiles based
on the ones from FreeBSD

This is getting commited now so that we can patch it up
fast in the tree.
There are known regressions so please don't try to build
this on your own now, please wait for the next available
snapshot.

If however you would still want to build it, make sure
build and install everything in the tools directory first.

This is not the full commit yet because there are several
subdirectories.
