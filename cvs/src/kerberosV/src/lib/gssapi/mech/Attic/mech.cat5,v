@The complexity and quality of kerberosV and the fact that almost
nobody is using it doesn't justify to have it in base - disable and
remove it.  If the 2 two people who use it still want it, they can
make a port or recompile OpenBSD on their own.

There is a quote in theo.c from August 2010: "basically, dung beetles
fucking.  that's what kerberosV + openssl is like".

Discussed with many.  Tests by henning@@ reyk@@ and others.

     The _/_e_t_c_/_g_s_s_/_m_e_c_h file contains a list of installed GSS-API security
     mechanisms.  Each line of the file either contains a comment if the first
     character is '#' or it contains five fields with the following meanings:

     Name          The name of this GSS-API mechanism.

     Object identifier
                   The OID for this mechanism.

     Library       A shared library containing the implementation of this
                   mechanism.

     Kernel module (optional)
                   A kernel module containing the implementation of this mech-
                   anism (not yet supported in FreeBSD).

     Library options (optional)
                   Optionsal parameters interpreted by the mechanism. Library
                   options must be enclosed in brackets ([ ]) to differentiate
                   them from the optional kernel module entry.

     The _/_e_t_c_/_g_s_s_/_q_o_p file contains a list of Quality of Protection values for
     use with GSS-API.  Each line of the file either contains a comment if the
     first character is '#' or it contains three fields with the following
     meanings:

     QOP string    The name of this Quality of Protection algorithm.

     QOP value     The numeric value used to select this algorithm for use
                   with GSS-API functions such as gss_get_mic(3).

     Mechanism name
                   The GSS-API mechanism name that corresponds to this algo-
                   rithm.

     This is a typical entry from _/_e_t_c_/_g_s_s_/_m_e_c_h:

log
@2nd part of:
update kerberosV to Heimdal 1.5.2 using BSD Makefiles based
on the ones from FreeBSD

This is getting commited now so that we can patch it up
fast in the tree.
There are known regressions so please don't try to build
this on your own now, please wait for the next available
snapshot.

If however you would still want to build it, make sure
build and install everything in the tools directory first.
