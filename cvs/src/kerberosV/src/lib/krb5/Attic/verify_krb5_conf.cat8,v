@The complexity and quality of kerberosV and the fact that almost
nobody is using it doesn't justify to have it in base - disable and
remove it.  If the 2 two people who use it still want it, they can
make a port or recompile OpenBSD on their own.

There is a quote in theo.c from August 2010: "basically, dung beetles
fucking.  that's what kerberosV + openssl is like".

Discussed with many.  Tests by henning@@ reyk@@ and others.

     Possible output from vveerriiffyy__kkrrbb55__ccoonnff include:

     <path>: failed to parse <something> as size/time/number/boolean
             Usually means that <something> is misspelled, or that it contains
             weird characters. The parsing done by vveerriiffyy__kkrrbb55__ccoonnff is more
             strict than the one performed by libkrb5, so strings that work in
             real life might be reported as bad.

     <path>: host not found (<hostname>)
             Means that <path> is supposed to point to a host, but it can't be
             recognised as one.

     <path>: unknown or wrong type
             Means that <path> is either a string when it should be a list,
             vice versa, or just that vveerriiffyy__kkrrbb55__ccoonnff is confused.

     <path>: unknown entry
             Means that <string> is not known by vveerriiffyy__kkrrbb55__ccoonnff.

     Since each application can put almost anything in the config file, it's
     hard to come up with a watertight verification process. Most of the
     default settings are sanity checked, but this does not mean that every
     problem is discovered, or that everything that is reported as a possible
     problem actually is one. This tool should thus be used with some care.

     It should warn about obsolete data, or bad practice, but currently
     doesn't.

@update kerberosV to Heimdal 1.5.2 using BSD Makefiles based
on the ones from FreeBSD

This is getting commited now so that we can patch it up
fast in the tree.
There are known regressions so please don't try to build
this on your own now, please wait for the next available
snapshot.

If however you would still want to build it, make sure
build and install everything in the tools directory first.

This is not the full commit yet because there are several
subdirectories.
