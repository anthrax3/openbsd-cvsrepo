@The complexity and quality of kerberosV and the fact that almost
nobody is using it doesn't justify to have it in base - disable and
remove it.  If the 2 two people who use it still want it, they can
make a port or recompile OpenBSD on their own.

There is a quote in theo.c from August 2010: "basically, dung beetles
fucking.  that's what kerberosV + openssl is like".

Discussed with many.  Tests by henning@@ reyk@@ and others.

.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Bf Em
All the functions in this manual page are deprecated in the MIT
implementation, and will soon be deprecated in Heimdal too, don't use them.
.Ef
.Pp
Getting initial credential ticket for a principal.
.Nm krb5_get_in_cred
is the function all other krb5_get_in function uses to fetch tickets.
The other krb5_get_in function are more specialized and therefor
somewhat easier to use.
.Pp
If your need is only to verify a user and password, consider using
.Xr krb5_verify_user 3
instead, it have a much simpler interface.
.Pp
.Nm krb5_get_in_tkt
and
.Nm krb5_get_in_cred
fetches initial credential, queries after key using the
.Fa key_proc
argument.
The differences between the two function is that
.Nm krb5_get_in_tkt
stores the credential in a
.Li krb5_creds
while
.Nm krb5_get_in_cred
stores the credential in a
.Li krb5_ccache .
.Pp
.Nm krb5_get_in_tkt_with_password ,
.Nm krb5_get_in_tkt_with_keytab ,
and
.Nm krb5_get_in_tkt_with_skey
does the same work as
.Nm krb5_get_in_cred
but are more specialized.
.Pp
.Nm krb5_get_in_tkt_with_password
uses the clients password to authenticate.
If the password argument is
.Dv NULL
the user user queried with the default password query function.
.Pp
.Nm krb5_get_in_tkt_with_keytab
searches the given keytab for a service entry for the client principal.
If the keytab is
.Dv NULL
the default keytab is used.
.Pp
.Nm krb5_get_in_tkt_with_skey
uses a key to get the initial credential.
.Pp
There are some common arguments to the krb5_get_in functions, these are:
.Pp
.Fa options
are the
.Dv KDC_OPT
flags.
.Pp
.Fa etypes
is a
.Dv NULL
terminated array of encryption types that the client approves.
.Pp
.Fa addrs
a list of the addresses that the initial ticket.
If it is
.Dv NULL
the list will be generated by the library.
.Pp
.Fa pre_auth_types
a
.Dv NULL
terminated array of pre-authentication types.
If
.Fa pre_auth_types
is
.Dv NULL
the function will try without pre-authentication and return those
pre-authentication that the KDC returned.
.Pp
.Fa ret_as_reply
will (if not
.Dv NULL )
be filled in with the response of the KDC and should be free with
.Fn krb5_free_kdc_rep .
.Pp
.Fa key_proc
is a pointer to a function that should return a key salted appropriately.
Using
.Dv NULL
will use the default password query function.
.Pp
.Fa decrypt_proc
Using
.Dv NULL
will use the default decryption function.
.Pp
.Fa decryptarg
will be passed to the decryption function
.Fa decrypt_proc .
.Pp
.Fa creds
creds should be filled in with the template for a credential that
should be requested.
The client and server elements of the creds structure must be filled in.
Upon return of the function it will be contain the content of the
requested credential
.Fa ( krb5_get_in_cred ) ,
or it will be freed with
.Xr krb5_free_creds 3
(all the other krb5_get_in functions).
.Pp
.Fa ccache
will store the credential in the credential cache
.Fa ccache .
The credential cache will not be initialized, thats up the the caller.
.Pp
.Nm krb5_password_key_proc
is a library function that is suitable using as the
.Fa krb5_key_proc
argument to
.Nm krb5_get_in_cred
or
.Nm krb5_get_in_tkt .
.Fa keyseed
should be a pointer to a
.Dv NUL
terminated string or
.Dv NULL .
.Nm krb5_password_key_proc
will query the user for the pass on the console if the password isn't
given as the argument
.Fa keyseed .
.Pp
.Fn krb5_free_kdc_rep
frees the content of
.Fa rep .

@update kerberosV to Heimdal 1.5.2 using BSD Makefiles based
on the ones from FreeBSD

This is getting commited now so that we can patch it up
fast in the tree.
There are known regressions so please don't try to build
this on your own now, please wait for the next available
snapshot.

If however you would still want to build it, make sure
build and install everything in the tools directory first.

This is not the full commit yet because there are several
subdirectories.
