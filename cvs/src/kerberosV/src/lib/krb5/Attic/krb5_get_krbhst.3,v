@The complexity and quality of kerberosV and the fact that almost
nobody is using it doesn't justify to have it in base - disable and
remove it.  If the 2 two people who use it still want it, they can
make a port or recompile OpenBSD on their own.

There is a quote in theo.c from August 2010: "basically, dung beetles
fucking.  that's what kerberosV + openssl is like".

Discussed with many.  Tests by henning@@ reyk@@ and others.

.Ft krb5_error_code
.Fn krb5_free_krbhst "krb5_context context" "char **hostlist"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
These functions implement the old API to get a list of Kerberos hosts,
and are thus similar to the
.Fn krb5_krbhst_init
functions. However, since these functions returns
.Em all
hosts in one go, they potentially have to do more lookups than
necessary. These functions remain for compatibility reasons.
.Pp
After a call to one of these functions,
.Fa hostlist
is a
.Dv NULL
terminated list of strings, pointing to the requested Kerberos hosts. These should be freed with
.Fn krb5_free_krbhst
when done with.
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following code will print the KDCs of the realm
.Dq MY.REALM .
.Bd -literal -offset indent
char **hosts, **p;
krb5_get_krbhst(context, "MY.REALM", &hosts);
for(p = hosts; *p; p++)
    printf("%s\\n", *p);
krb5_free_krbhst(context, hosts);

@update kerberosV to Heimdal 1.5.2 using BSD Makefiles based
on the ones from FreeBSD

This is getting commited now so that we can patch it up
fast in the tree.
There are known regressions so please don't try to build
this on your own now, please wait for the next available
snapshot.

If however you would still want to build it, make sure
build and install everything in the tools directory first.

This is not the full commit yet because there are several
subdirectories.
