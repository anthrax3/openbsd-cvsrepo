@The complexity and quality of kerberosV and the fact that almost
nobody is using it doesn't justify to have it in base - disable and
remove it.  If the 2 two people who use it still want it, they can
make a port or recompile OpenBSD on their own.

There is a quote in theo.c from August 2010: "basically, dung beetles
fucking.  that's what kerberosV + openssl is like".

Discussed with many.  Tests by henning@@ reyk@@ and others.

.Sh DESCRIPTION
Convert the Kerberos 5 credential to Kerberos 4 credential.
This is done by sending them to the 524 service in the KDC.
.Pp
.Fn krb524_convert_creds_kdc
converts the Kerberos 5 credential in
.Fa in_cred
to Kerberos 4 credential that is stored in
.Fa credentials .
.Pp
.Fn krb524_convert_creds_kdc_ccache
is different from
.Fn krb524_convert_creds_kdc
in that way that if
.Fa in_cred
doesn't contain a DES session key, then a new one is fetched from the
KDC and stored in the cred cache
.Fa ccache ,
and then the KDC is queried to convert the credential.
.Pp
This interfaces are used to make the migration to Kerberos 5 from
Kerberos 4 easier.
There are few services that still need Kerberos 4, and this is mainly
for compatibility for those services.
Some services, like AFS, really have Kerberos 5 supports, but still
uses the 524 interface to make the migration easier.

@update kerberosV to Heimdal 1.5.2 using BSD Makefiles based
on the ones from FreeBSD

This is getting commited now so that we can patch it up
fast in the tree.
There are known regressions so please don't try to build
this on your own now, please wait for the next available
snapshot.

If however you would still want to build it, make sure
build and install everything in the tools directory first.

This is not the full commit yet because there are several
subdirectories.
