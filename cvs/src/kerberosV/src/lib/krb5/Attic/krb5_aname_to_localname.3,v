@The complexity and quality of kerberosV and the fact that almost
nobody is using it doesn't justify to have it in base - disable and
remove it.  If the 2 two people who use it still want it, they can
make a port or recompile OpenBSD on their own.

There is a quote in theo.c from August 2010: "basically, dung beetles
fucking.  that's what kerberosV + openssl is like".

Discussed with many.  Tests by henning@@ reyk@@ and others.

.Dt KRB5_ANAME_TO_LOCALNAME 3
.Os HEIMDAL
.Sh NAME
.Nm krb5_aname_to_localname
.Nd converts a principal to a system local name
.Sh LIBRARY
Kerberos 5 Library (libkrb5, -lkrb5)
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In krb5.h
.Ft krb5_boolean
.Fo krb5_aname_to_localname
.Fa "krb5_context context"
.Fa "krb5_const_principal name"
.Fa "size_t lnsize"
.Fa "char *lname"
.Fc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This function takes a principal
.Fa name ,
verifies that it is in the local realm (using
.Fn krb5_get_default_realms )
and then returns the local name of the principal.
.Pp
If
.Fa name
isn't in one of the local realms an error is returned.
.Pp
If the size
.Fa ( lnsize )
of the local name
.Fa ( lname )
is too small, an error is returned.
.Pp
.Fn krb5_aname_to_localname
should only be use by an application that implements protocols that
don't transport the login name and thus needs to convert a principal
to a local name.
.Pp
Protocols should be designed so that they authenticate using
Kerberos, send over the login name and then verify the principal
that is authenticated is allowed to login and the login name.
A way to check if a user is allowed to login is using the function
.Fn krb5_kuserok .

@update kerberosV to Heimdal 1.5.2 using BSD Makefiles based
on the ones from FreeBSD

This is getting commited now so that we can patch it up
fast in the tree.
There are known regressions so please don't try to build
this on your own now, please wait for the next available
snapshot.

If however you would still want to build it, make sure
build and install everything in the tools directory first.

This is not the full commit yet because there are several
subdirectories.
