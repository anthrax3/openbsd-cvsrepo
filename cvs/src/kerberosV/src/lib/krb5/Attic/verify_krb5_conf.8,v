@The complexity and quality of kerberosV and the fact that almost
nobody is using it doesn't justify to have it in base - disable and
remove it.  If the 2 two people who use it still want it, they can
make a port or recompile OpenBSD on their own.

There is a quote in theo.c from August 2010: "basically, dung beetles
fucking.  that's what kerberosV + openssl is like".

Discussed with many.  Tests by henning@@ reyk@@ and others.

.Ar [config-file]
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
reads the configuration file
.Pa krb5.conf ,
or the file given on the command line,
parses it, checking verifying that the syntax is not correctly wrong.
.Pp
If the file is syntactically correct,
.Nm
tries to verify that the contents of the file is of relevant nature.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Ev KRB5_CONFIG
points to the configuration file to read.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /etc/krb5.conf -compact
.It Pa /etc/krb5.conf

.El
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
Possible output from
.Nm
include:
.Bl -tag -width "FpathF"
.It "<path>: failed to parse <something> as size/time/number/boolean"
Usually means that <something> is misspelled, or that it contains
weird characters. The parsing done by
.Nm
is more strict than the one performed by libkrb5, so strings that
work in real life might be reported as bad.
.It "<path>: host not found (<hostname>)"
Means that <path> is supposed to point to a host, but it can't be
recognised as one.
.It <path>: unknown or wrong type
Means that <path> is either a string when it should be a list, vice
versa, or just that
.Nm
is confused.
.It <path>: unknown entry
Means that <string> is not known by
.Nm .
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr krb5.conf 5
.Sh BUGS
Since each application can put almost anything in the config file,
it's hard to come up with a watertight verification process. Most of
the default settings are sanity checked, but this does not mean that
every problem is discovered, or that everything that is reported as a
possible problem actually is one. This tool should thus be used with
some care.
.Pp
It should warn about obsolete data, or bad practice, but currently
doesn't.

@update kerberosV to Heimdal 1.5.2 using BSD Makefiles based
on the ones from FreeBSD

This is getting commited now so that we can patch it up
fast in the tree.
There are known regressions so please don't try to build
this on your own now, please wait for the next available
snapshot.

If however you would still want to build it, make sure
build and install everything in the tools directory first.

This is not the full commit yet because there are several
subdirectories.

Since that file is read by almost all Kerberos programs but most of

this program is useful.

Lots of changes, highlights include:

 * change default keytab to ANY:FILE:/etc/krb5.keytab,krb4:/etc/srvtab,
   the new keytab type that tries both of these in order (SRVTAB is
   also an alias for krb4:)

 * improve error reporting and error handling (error messages should
   be more detailed and more useful)

 * the API is closer to what MIT krb5 is using

 * more compatible with windows 2000

 * removed some memory leaks

 * bug fixes
