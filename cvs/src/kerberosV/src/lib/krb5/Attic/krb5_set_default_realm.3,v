@The complexity and quality of kerberosV and the fact that almost
nobody is using it doesn't justify to have it in base - disable and
remove it.  If the 2 two people who use it still want it, they can
make a port or recompile OpenBSD on their own.

There is a quote in theo.c from August 2010: "basically, dung beetles
fucking.  that's what kerberosV + openssl is like".

Discussed with many.  Tests by henning@@ reyk@@ and others.

.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn krb5_copy_host_realm
copies the list of realms from
.Fa from
to
.Fa to .
.Fa to
should be freed by the caller using
.Fa krb5_free_host_realm .
.Pp
.Fn krb5_free_host_realm
frees all memory allocated by
.Fa realmlist .
.Pp
.Fn krb5_get_default_realm
returns the first default realm for this host.
The realm returned should be freed with
.Fn free .
.Pp
.Fn krb5_get_default_realms
returns a
.Dv NULL
terminated list of default realms for this context.
Realms returned by
.Fn krb5_get_default_realms
should be freed with
.Fn krb5_free_host_realm .
.Pp
.Fn krb5_get_host_realm
returns a
.Dv NULL
terminated list of realms for
.Fa host
by looking up the information in the
.Li [domain_realm]
in
.Pa krb5.conf
or in
.Li DNS .
If the mapping in
.Li [domain_realm]
results in the string
.Li dns_locate ,
DNS is used to lookup the realm.
.Pp
When using
.Li DNS
to a resolve the domain for the host a.b.c,
.Fn krb5_get_host_realm
looks for a
.Dv TXT
resource record named
.Li _kerberos.a.b.c ,
and if not found, it strips off the first component and tries a again
(_kerberos.b.c) until it reaches the root.
.Pp
If there is no configuration or DNS information found,
.Fn krb5_get_host_realm
assumes it can use the domain part of the
.Fa host
to form a realm.
Caller must free
.Fa realmlist
with
.Fn krb5_free_host_realm .
.Pp
.Fn krb5_set_default_realm
sets the default realm for the
.Fa context .
If
.Dv NULL
is used as a
.Fa realm ,
the
.Li [libdefaults]default_realm
stanza in
.Pa krb5.conf
is used.
If there is no such stanza in the configuration file, the
.Fn krb5_get_host_realm
function is used to form a default realm.

@update kerberosV to Heimdal 1.5.2 using BSD Makefiles based
on the ones from FreeBSD

This is getting commited now so that we can patch it up
fast in the tree.
There are known regressions so please don't try to build
this on your own now, please wait for the next available
snapshot.

If however you would still want to build it, make sure
build and install everything in the tools directory first.

This is not the full commit yet because there are several
subdirectories.
