@The complexity and quality of kerberosV and the fact that almost
nobody is using it doesn't justify to have it in base - disable and
remove it.  If the 2 two people who use it still want it, they can
make a port or recompile OpenBSD on their own.

There is a quote in theo.c from August 2010: "basically, dung beetles
fucking.  that's what kerberosV + openssl is like".

Discussed with many.  Tests by henning@@ reyk@@ and others.

.Sh DESCRIPTION
These functions are used to sequence through all Kerberos hosts of a
particular realm and service. The service type can be the KDCs, the
administrative servers, the password changing servers, or the servers
for Kerberos 4 ticket conversion.
.Pp
First a handle to a particular service is obtained by calling
.Fn krb5_krbhst_init
(or
.Fn krb5_krbhst_init_flags )
with the
.Fa realm
of interest and the type of service to lookup. The
.Fa type
can be one of:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact -offset indent
.It KRB5_KRBHST_KDC
.It KRB5_KRBHST_ADMIN
.It KRB5_KRBHST_CHANGEPW
.It KRB5_KRBHST_KRB524
.El
.Pp
The
.Fa handle
is returned to the caller, and should be passed to the other
functions.
.Pp
The
.Fa flag
argument to
.Nm krb5_krbhst_init_flags
is the same flags as
.Fn krb5_send_to_kdc_flags
uses.
Possible values are:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width KRB5_KRBHST_FLAGS_LARGE_MSG -compact -offset indent
.It KRB5_KRBHST_FLAGS_MASTER
only talk to master (readwrite) KDC
.It KRB5_KRBHST_FLAGS_LARGE_MSG
this is a large message, so use transport that can handle that.
.El
.Pp
For each call to
.Fn krb5_krbhst_next
information on a new host is returned. The former function returns in
.Fa host
a pointer to a structure containing information about the host, such
as protocol, hostname, and port:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
typedef struct krb5_krbhst_info {
    enum { KRB5_KRBHST_UDP,
	   KRB5_KRBHST_TCP,
	   KRB5_KRBHST_HTTP } proto;
    unsigned short port;
    struct addrinfo *ai;
    struct krb5_krbhst_info *next;
    char hostname[1];
} krb5_krbhst_info;
.Ed
.Pp
The related function,
.Fn krb5_krbhst_next_as_string ,
return the same information as a URL-like string.
.Pp
When there are no more hosts, these functions return
.Dv KRB5_KDC_UNREACH .
.Pp
To re-iterate over all hosts, call
.Fn krb5_krbhst_reset
and the next call to
.Fn krb5_krbhst_next
will return the first host.
.Pp
When done with the handle,
.Fn krb5_krbhst_free
should be called.
.Pp
To use a
.Va krb5_krbhst_info ,
there are two functions:
.Fn krb5_krbhst_format_string
that will return a printable representation of that struct
and
.Fn krb5_krbhst_get_addrinfo
that will return a
.Va struct addrinfo
that can then be used for communicating with the server mentioned.
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following code will print the KDCs of the realm
.Dq MY.REALM :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
krb5_krbhst_handle handle;
char host[MAXHOSTNAMELEN];
krb5_krbhst_init(context, "MY.REALM", KRB5_KRBHST_KDC, &handle);
while(krb5_krbhst_next_as_string(context, handle,
				 host, sizeof(host)) == 0)
    printf("%s\\n", host);
krb5_krbhst_free(context, handle);

@update kerberosV to Heimdal 1.5.2 using BSD Makefiles based
on the ones from FreeBSD

This is getting commited now so that we can patch it up
fast in the tree.
There are known regressions so please don't try to build
this on your own now, please wait for the next available
snapshot.

If however you would still want to build it, make sure
build and install everything in the tools directory first.

This is not the full commit yet because there are several
subdirectories.
