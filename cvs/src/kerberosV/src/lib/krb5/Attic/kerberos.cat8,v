@The complexity and quality of kerberosV and the fact that almost
nobody is using it doesn't justify to have it in base - disable and
remove it.  If the 2 two people who use it still want it, they can
make a port or recompile OpenBSD on their own.

There is a quote in theo.c from August 2010: "basically, dung beetles
fucking.  that's what kerberosV + openssl is like".

Discussed with many.  Tests by henning@@ reyk@@ and others.

KERBEROS(8)               BSD System Manager's Manual              KERBEROS(8)

     kkeerrbbeerrooss -- introduction to the Kerberos system

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     Kerberos is a network authentication system. Its purpose is to securely
     authenticate users and services in an insecure network environment.

     This is done with a Kerberos server acting as a trusted third party,
     keeping a database with secret keys for all users and services (collec-
     tively called _p_r_i_n_c_i_p_a_l_s).

     Each principal belongs to exactly one _r_e_a_l_m, which is the administrative
     domain in Kerberos. A realm usually corresponds to an organisation, and
     the realm should normally be derived from that organisation's domain
     name. A realm is served by one or more Kerberos servers.

     The authentication process involves exchange of `tickets' and
     `authenticators' which together prove the principal's identity.

     When you login to the Kerberos system, either through the normal system
     login or with the kinit(1) program, you acquire a _t_i_c_k_e_t _g_r_a_n_t_i_n_g _t_i_c_k_e_t
     which allows you to get new tickets for other services, such as tteellnneett or
     ffttpp, without giving your password.

     For more information on how Kerberos works, and other general Kerberos
     questions see the Kerberos FAQ at
     _h_t_t_p_:_/_/_w_w_w_._n_r_l_._n_a_v_y_._m_i_l_/_C_C_S_/_p_e_o_p_l_e_/_k_e_n_h_/_k_e_r_b_e_r_o_s_-_f_a_q_._h_t_m_l.

     For setup instructions see the Heimdal Texinfo manual.

     The Kerberos authentication system was developed in the late 1980's as
     part of the Athena Project at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
     Versions one through three never reached outside MIT, but version 4 was
     (and still is) quite popular, especially in the academic community, but
     is also used in commercial products like the AFS filesystem.

     The problems with version 4 are that it has many limitations, the code
     was not too well written (since it had been developed over a long time),
     and it has a number of known security problems. To resolve many of these
     issues work on version five started, and resulted in IETF RFC 1510 in
     1993. IETF RFC 1510 was obsoleted in 2005 with IETF RFC 4120, also known
     as Kerberos clarifications. With the arrival of IETF RFC 4120, the work
     on adding extensibility and internationalization have started (Kerberos
     extensions), and a new RFC will hopefully appear soon.

     This manual page is part of the HHeeiimmddaall Kerberos 5 distribution, which
     has been in development at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stock-
     holm, Sweden, since about 1997.

@update kerberosV to Heimdal 1.5.2 using BSD Makefiles based
on the ones from FreeBSD

This is getting commited now so that we can patch it up
fast in the tree.
There are known regressions so please don't try to build
this on your own now, please wait for the next available
snapshot.

If however you would still want to build it, make sure
build and install everything in the tools directory first.

This is not the full commit yet because there are several
subdirectories.
