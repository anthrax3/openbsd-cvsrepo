@The complexity and quality of kerberosV and the fact that almost
nobody is using it doesn't justify to have it in base - disable and
remove it.  If the 2 two people who use it still want it, they can
make a port or recompile OpenBSD on their own.

There is a quote in theo.c from August 2010: "basically, dung beetles
fucking.  that's what kerberosV + openssl is like".

Discussed with many.  Tests by henning@@ reyk@@ and others.

.Sh DESCRIPTION
Usually applications never needs to parse and understand Kerberos
error messages since higher level functions will parse and push up the
error in the krb5_context.
These functions are described for completeness.
.Pp
.Fn krb5_rd_error
parses and returns the kerboeros error message, the structure should be freed with
.Fn krb5_free_error_contents
when the caller is done with the structure.
.Pp
.Fn krb5_free_error
frees the content and the memory region holding the structure iself.
.Pp
.Fn krb5_free_error_contents
free the content of the KRB-ERROR message.
.Pp
.Fn krb5_error_from_rd_error
will parse the error message and set the error buffer in krb5_context
to the error string passed back or the matching error code in the
KRB-ERROR message.
Caller should pick up the message with
.Fn krb5_get_error_string 3
(don't forget to free the returned string with
.Fn krb5_free_error_string ) .

@update kerberosV to Heimdal 1.5.2 using BSD Makefiles based
on the ones from FreeBSD

This is getting commited now so that we can patch it up
fast in the tree.
There are known regressions so please don't try to build
this on your own now, please wait for the next available
snapshot.

If however you would still want to build it, make sure
build and install everything in the tools directory first.

This is not the full commit yet because there are several
subdirectories.
