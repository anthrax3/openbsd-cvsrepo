@The complexity and quality of kerberosV and the fact that almost
nobody is using it doesn't justify to have it in base - disable and
remove it.  If the 2 two people who use it still want it, they can
make a port or recompile OpenBSD on their own.

There is a quote in theo.c from August 2010: "basically, dung beetles
fucking.  that's what kerberosV + openssl is like".

Discussed with many.  Tests by henning@@ reyk@@ and others.

.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm krb5_set_real_time
sets the absolute time that the caller knows the KDC has.
With this the Kerberos library can calculate the relative
difference between the KDC time and the local system time and store it
in the
.Fa context .
With this information the Kerberos library can adjust all time stamps
in Kerberos packages.
.Pp
.Fn krb5_timeofday
returns the current time, but adjusted with the time difference
between the local host and the KDC.
.Fn krb5_us_timeofday
also returns microseconds.
.Pp
.Nm krb5_format_time
formats the time
.Fa t
into the string
.Fa s
of length
.Fa len .
If
.Fa include_time
is set, the time is set include_time.
.Pp
.Nm krb5_string_to_deltat
parses delta time
.Fa string
into
.Fa deltat .

@update kerberosV to Heimdal 1.5.2 using BSD Makefiles based
on the ones from FreeBSD

This is getting commited now so that we can patch it up
fast in the tree.
There are known regressions so please don't try to build
this on your own now, please wait for the next available
snapshot.

If however you would still want to build it, make sure
build and install everything in the tools directory first.

This is not the full commit yet because there are several
subdirectories.
