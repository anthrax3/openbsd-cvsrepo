@The complexity and quality of kerberosV and the fact that almost
nobody is using it doesn't justify to have it in base - disable and
remove it.  If the 2 two people who use it still want it, they can
make a port or recompile OpenBSD on their own.

There is a quote in theo.c from August 2010: "basically, dung beetles
fucking.  that's what kerberosV + openssl is like".

Discussed with many.  Tests by henning@@ reyk@@ and others.

.Sh DESCRIPTION
These functions logs messages to one or more destinations.
.Pp
The
.Fn krb5_openlog
function creates a logging
.Fa facility ,
that is used to log messages. A facility consists of one or more
destinations (which can be files or syslog or some other device). The
.Fa program
parameter should be the generic name of the program that is doing the
logging. This name is used to lookup which destinations to use. This
information is contained in the
.Li logging
section of the
.Pa krb5.conf
configuration file.  If no entry is found for
.Fa program ,
the entry for
.Li default
is used, or if that is missing too,
.Li SYSLOG
will be used as destination.
.Pp
To close a logging facility, use the
.Fn krb5_closelog
function.
.Pp
To log a message to a facility use one of the functions
.Fn krb5_log ,
.Fn krb5_log_msg ,
.Fn krb5_vlog ,
or
.Fn krb5_vlog_msg .
The functions ending in
.Li _msg
return in
.Fa reply
a pointer to the message that just got logged. This string is allocated,
and should be freed with
.Fn free .
The
.Fa format
is a standard
.Fn printf
style format string (but see the BUGS section).
.Pp
If you want better control of where things gets logged, you can instead of using
.Fn krb5_openlog
call
.Fn krb5_initlog ,
which just initializes a facility, but doesn't define any actual logging
destinations. You can then add destinations with the
.Fn krb5_addlog_dest
and
.Fn krb5_addlog_func
functions.  The first of these takes a string specifying a logging
destination, and adds this to the facility. If you want to do some
non-standard logging you can use the
.Fn krb5_addlog_func
function, which takes a function to use when logging.
The
.Fa log
function is called for each message with
.Fa time
being a string specifying the current time, and
.Fa message
the message to log.
.Fa close
is called when the facility is closed. You can pass application specific data in the
.Fa data
parameter. The
.Fa min
and
.Fa max
parameter are the same as in a destination (defined below). To specify a
max of infinity, pass -1.
.Pp
.Fn krb5_openlog
calls
.Fn krb5_initlog
and then calls
.Fn krb5_addlog_dest
for each destination found.
.Ss Destinations
The defined destinations (as specified in
.Pa krb5.conf )
follows:
.Bl -tag -width "xxx" -offset indent
.It Li STDERR
This logs to the program's stderr.
.It Li FILE: Ns Pa /file
.It Li FILE= Ns Pa /file
Log to the specified file. The form using a colon appends to the file, the
form with an equal truncates the file. The truncating form keeps the file
open, while the appending form closes it after each log message (which
makes it possible to rotate logs). The truncating form is mainly for
compatibility with the MIT libkrb5.
.It Li DEVICE= Ns Pa /device
This logs to the specified device, at present this is the same as
.Li FILE:/device .
.It Li CONSOLE
Log to the console, this is the same as
.Li DEVICE=/dev/console .
.It Li SYSLOG Ns Op :priority Ns Op :facility
Send messages to the syslog system, using priority, and facility. To
get the name for one of these, you take the name of the macro passed
to
.Xr syslog 3 ,
and remove the leading
.Li LOG_
.No ( Li LOG_NOTICE
becomes
.Li NOTICE ) .
The default values (as well as the values used for unrecognised
values), are
.Li ERR ,
and
.Li AUTH ,
respectively.  See
.Xr syslog 3
for a list of priorities and facilities.
.El
.Pp
Each destination may optionally be prepended with a range of logging
levels, specified as
.Li min-max/ .
If the
.Fa level
parameter to
.Fn krb5_log
is within this range (inclusive) the message gets logged to this
destination, otherwise not. Either of the min and max valued may be
omitted, in this case min is assumed to be zero, and max is assumed to be
infinity.  If you don't include a dash, both min and max gets set to the
specified value. If no range is specified, all messages gets logged.
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Bd -literal -offset indent
[logging]
	kdc = 0/FILE:/var/log/kdc.log
	kdc = 1-/SYSLOG:INFO:USER
	default = STDERR
.Ed
.Pp
This will log all messages from the
.Nm kdc
program with level 0 to
.Pa /var/log/kdc.log ,
other messages will be logged to syslog with priority
.Li LOG_INFO ,
and facility
.Li LOG_USER .
All other programs will log all messages to their stderr.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr syslog 3 ,
.Xr krb5.conf 5
.Sh BUGS
These functions use
.Fn asprintf
to format the message. If your operating system does not have a working
.Fn asprintf ,
a replacement will be used. At present this replacement does not handle
some correct conversion specifications (like floating point numbers). Until
this is fixed, the use of these conversions should be avoided.
.Pp
If logging is done to the syslog facility, these functions might not be
thread-safe, depending on the implementation of
.Fn openlog ,
and
.Fn syslog .

@update kerberosV to Heimdal 1.5.2 using BSD Makefiles based
on the ones from FreeBSD

This is getting commited now so that we can patch it up
fast in the tree.
There are known regressions so please don't try to build
this on your own now, please wait for the next available
snapshot.

If however you would still want to build it, make sure
build and install everything in the tools directory first.

This is not the full commit yet because there are several
subdirectories.
