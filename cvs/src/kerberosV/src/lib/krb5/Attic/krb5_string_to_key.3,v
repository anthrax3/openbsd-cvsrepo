@The complexity and quality of kerberosV and the fact that almost
nobody is using it doesn't justify to have it in base - disable and
remove it.  If the 2 two people who use it still want it, they can
make a port or recompile OpenBSD on their own.

There is a quote in theo.c from August 2010: "basically, dung beetles
fucking.  that's what kerberosV + openssl is like".

Discussed with many.  Tests by henning@@ reyk@@ and others.

.Sh DESCRIPTION
The string to key functions convert a string to a kerberos key.
.Pp
.Fn krb5_string_to_key_data_salt_opaque
is the function that does all the work, the rest of the functions are
just wrappers around
.Fn krb5_string_to_key_data_salt_opaque
that calls it with default values.
.Pp
.Fn krb5_string_to_key_data_salt_opaque
transforms the
.Fa password
with the given salt-string
.Fa salt
and the opaque, encryption type specific parameter
.Fa opaque
to a encryption key
.Fa key
according to the string to key function associated with
.Fa enctype .
.Pp
The
.Fa key
should be freed with
.Fn krb5_free_keyblock_contents .
.Pp
If one of the functions that doesn't take a
.Li krb5_salt
as it argument
.Fn krb5_get_pw_salt
is used to get the salt value.
.Pp
.Fn krb5_get_pw_salt
get the default password salt for a principal, use
.Fn krb5_free_salt
to free the salt when done.
.Pp
.Fn krb5_free_salt
frees the content of
.Fa salt .

@update kerberosV to Heimdal 1.5.2 using BSD Makefiles based
on the ones from FreeBSD

This is getting commited now so that we can patch it up
fast in the tree.
There are known regressions so please don't try to build
this on your own now, please wait for the next available
snapshot.

If however you would still want to build it, make sure
build and install everything in the tools directory first.

This is not the full commit yet because there are several
subdirectories.

.Fn krb5_string_to_key_derived
only works for

if you use on on some other enctypes, it will produce the wrong result.
