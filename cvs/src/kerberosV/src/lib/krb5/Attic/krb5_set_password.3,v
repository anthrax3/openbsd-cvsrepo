@The complexity and quality of kerberosV and the fact that almost
nobody is using it doesn't justify to have it in base - disable and
remove it.  If the 2 two people who use it still want it, they can
make a port or recompile OpenBSD on their own.

There is a quote in theo.c from August 2010: "basically, dung beetles
fucking.  that's what kerberosV + openssl is like".

Discussed with many.  Tests by henning@@ reyk@@ and others.

.Sh DESCRIPTION
These functions change the password for a given principal.
.Pp
.Fn krb5_set_password
and
.Fn krb5_set_password_using_ccache
are the newer of the three functions, and use a newer version of the
protocol (and also fall back to the older set-password protocol if the
newer protocol doesn't work).
.Pp
.Fn krb5_change_password
sets the password
.Fa newpasswd
for the client principal in
.Fa creds .
The server principal of creds must be
.Li kadmin/changepw .
.Pp
.Fn krb5_set_password
and
.Fn krb5_set_password_using_ccache
change the password for the principal
.Fa targprinc .
.Pp
.Fn krb5_set_password
requires that the credential for
.Li kadmin/changepw@@REALM
is in
.Fa creds .
If the user caller isn't an administrator, this credential
needs to be an initial credential, see
.Xr krb5_get_init_creds 3
how to get such credentials.
.Pp
.Fn krb5_set_password_using_ccache
will get the credential from
.Fa ccache .
.Pp
If
.Fa targprinc
is
.Dv NULL ,
.Fn krb5_set_password_using_ccache
uses the the default principal in
.Fa ccache
and
.Fn krb5_set_password
uses the global the default principal.
.Pp
All three functions return an error in
.Fa result_code
and maybe an error string to print in
.Fa result_string .
.Pp
.Fn krb5_passwd_result_to_string
returns an human readable string describing the error code in
.Fa result_code
from the
.Fn krb5_set_password
functions.

@update kerberosV to Heimdal 1.5.2 using BSD Makefiles based
on the ones from FreeBSD

This is getting commited now so that we can patch it up
fast in the tree.
There are known regressions so please don't try to build
this on your own now, please wait for the next available
snapshot.

If however you would still want to build it, make sure
build and install everything in the tools directory first.

This is not the full commit yet because there are several
subdirectories.
