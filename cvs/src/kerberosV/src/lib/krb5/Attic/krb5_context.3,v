@update kerberosV to Heimdal 1.5.2 using BSD Makefiles based
on the ones from FreeBSD

This is getting commited now so that we can patch it up
fast in the tree.
There are known regressions so please don't try to build
this on your own now, please wait for the next available
snapshot.

If however you would still want to build it, make sure
build and install everything in the tools directory first.

This is not the full commit yet because there are several
subdirectories.

The

structure is designed to hold all per thread state. All global
variables that are context specific are stored in this structure,
including default encryption types, credentials-cache (ticket file), and
default realms.
.Pp
The internals of the structure should never be accessed directly,
functions exist for extracting information.
