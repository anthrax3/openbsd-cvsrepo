@The complexity and quality of kerberosV and the fact that almost
nobody is using it doesn't justify to have it in base - disable and
remove it.  If the 2 two people who use it still want it, they can
make a port or recompile OpenBSD on their own.

There is a quote in theo.c from August 2010: "basically, dung beetles
fucking.  that's what kerberosV + openssl is like".

Discussed with many.  Tests by henning@@ reyk@@ and others.

.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm krb5_verify_init_creds
function verifies the initial tickets with the local keytab to make
sure the response of the KDC was spoof-ed.
.Pp
.Nm krb5_verify_init_creds
will use principal
.Fa ap_req_server
from the local keytab, if
.Dv NULL
is passed in, the code will guess the local hostname and use that to
form host/hostname/GUESSED-REALM-FOR-HOSTNAME.
.Fa creds
is the credential that
.Nm krb5_verify_init_creds
should verify.
If
.Fa ccache
is given
.Fn krb5_verify_init_creds
stores all credentials it fetched from the KDC there, otherwise it
will use a memory credential cache that is destroyed when done.
.Pp
.Fn krb5_verify_init_creds_opt_init
cleans the the structure, must be used before trying to pass it in to
.Fn krb5_verify_init_creds .
.Pp
.Fn krb5_verify_init_creds_opt_set_ap_req_nofail
controls controls the behavior if
.Fa ap_req_server
doesn't exists in the local keytab or in the KDC's database, if it's
true, the error will be ignored.  Note that this use is possible
insecure.

@update kerberosV to Heimdal 1.5.2 using BSD Makefiles based
on the ones from FreeBSD

This is getting commited now so that we can patch it up
fast in the tree.
There are known regressions so please don't try to build
this on your own now, please wait for the next available
snapshot.

If however you would still want to build it, make sure
build and install everything in the tools directory first.

This is not the full commit yet because there are several
subdirectories.
