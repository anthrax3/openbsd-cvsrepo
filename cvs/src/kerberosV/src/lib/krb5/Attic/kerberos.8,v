@The complexity and quality of kerberosV and the fact that almost
nobody is using it doesn't justify to have it in base - disable and
remove it.  If the 2 two people who use it still want it, they can
make a port or recompile OpenBSD on their own.

There is a quote in theo.c from August 2010: "basically, dung beetles
fucking.  that's what kerberosV + openssl is like".

Discussed with many.  Tests by henning@@ reyk@@ and others.

.Sh NAME
.Nm kerberos
.Nd introduction to the Kerberos system
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Kerberos is a network authentication system. Its purpose is to
securely authenticate users and services in an insecure network
environment.
.Pp
This is done with a Kerberos server acting as a trusted third party,
keeping a database with secret keys for all users and services
(collectively called
.Em principals ) .
.Pp
Each principal belongs to exactly one
.Em realm ,
which is the administrative domain in Kerberos. A realm usually
corresponds to an organisation, and the realm should normally be
derived from that organisation's domain name. A realm is served by one
or more Kerberos servers.
.Pp
The authentication process involves exchange of
.Sq tickets
and
.Sq authenticators
which together prove the principal's identity.
.Pp
When you login to the Kerberos system, either through the normal
system login or with the
.Xr kinit 1
program, you acquire a
.Em ticket granting ticket
which allows you to get new tickets for other services, such as
.Ic telnet
or
.Ic ftp ,
without giving your password.
.Pp
For more information on how Kerberos works, and other general Kerberos
questions see the Kerberos FAQ at
.Pa http://www.nrl.navy.mil/CCS/people/kenh/kerberos-faq.html .
.Pp
For setup instructions see the Heimdal Texinfo manual.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr ftp 1 ,
.Xr kdestroy 1 ,
.Xr kinit 1 ,
.Xr klist 1 ,
.Xr kpasswd 1 ,
.Xr telnet 1
.Sh HISTORY
The Kerberos authentication system was developed in the late 1980's as
part of the Athena Project at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology. Versions one through three never reached outside MIT, but
version 4 was (and still is) quite popular, especially in the academic
community, but is also used in commercial products like the AFS
filesystem.
.Pp
The problems with version 4 are that it has many limitations, the code
was not too well written (since it had been developed over a long
time), and it has a number of known security problems. To resolve many
of these issues work on version five started, and resulted in IETF RFC
1510 in 1993. IETF RFC 1510 was obsoleted in 2005 with IETF RFC 4120,
also known as Kerberos clarifications. With the arrival of IETF RFC
4120, the work on adding extensibility and internationalization have
started (Kerberos extensions), and a new RFC will hopefully appear
soon.
.Pp
This manual page is part of the
.Nm Heimdal
Kerberos 5 distribution, which has been in development at the Royal
Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden, since about 1997.

@update kerberosV to Heimdal 1.5.2 using BSD Makefiles based
on the ones from FreeBSD

This is getting commited now so that we can patch it up
fast in the tree.
There are known regressions so please don't try to build
this on your own now, please wait for the next available
snapshot.

If however you would still want to build it, make sure
build and install everything in the tools directory first.

This is not the full commit yet because there are several
subdirectories.

@Import of heimdal-0.3f

Lots of changes, highlights include:

 * change default keytab to ANY:FILE:/etc/krb5.keytab,krb4:/etc/srvtab,
   the new keytab type that tries both of these in order (SRVTAB is
   also an alias for krb4:)

 * improve error reporting and error handling (error messages should
   be more detailed and more useful)

 * the API is closer to what MIT krb5 is using

 * more compatible with windows 2000

 * removed some memory leaks

 * bug fixes
