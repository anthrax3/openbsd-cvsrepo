@update kerberosV to Heimdal 1.5.2 using BSD Makefiles based
on the ones from FreeBSD

This is getting commited now so that we can patch it up
fast in the tree.
There are known regressions so please don't try to build
this on your own now, please wait for the next available
snapshot.

If however you would still want to build it, make sure
build and install everything in the tools directory first.

This is not the full commit yet because there are several
subdirectories.

.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Li krb5_data
structure holds a data element.
The structure contains two public accessible elements
.Fa length
(the length of data)
and
.Fa data
(the data itself).
The structure must always be initiated and freed by the functions
documented in this manual.
.Pp
.Fn krb5_data_zero
resets the content of
.Fa p .
.Pp
.Fn krb5_data_free
free the data in
.Fa p
and reset the content of the structure with
.Fn krb5_data_zero .
.Pp
.Fn krb5_free_data_contents
works the same way as
.Fa krb5_data_free .
The diffrence is that krb5_free_data_contents is more portable (exists
in MIT api).
.Pp
.Fn krb5_free_data
frees the data in
.Fa p
and
.Fa p
itself.
.Pp
.Fn krb5_data_alloc
allocates
.Fa len
bytes in
.Fa p .
Returns 0 or an error.
.Pp
.Fn  krb5_data_realloc
reallocates the length of
.Fa p
to the length in
.Fa len .
Returns 0 or an error.
.Pp
.Fn krb5_data_copy
copies the
.Fa data
that have the length
.Fa len
into
.Fa p .
.Fa p
is not freed so the calling function should make sure the
.Fa p
doesn't contain anything needs to be freed.
Returns 0 or an error.
.Pp
.Fn krb5_copy_data
copies the
.Li krb5_data
in
.Fa indata
to
.Fa outdata .
.Fa outdata
is not freed so the calling function should make sure the
.Fa outdata
doesn't contain anything needs to be freed.
.Fa outdata
should be freed using
.Fn krb5_free_data .
Returns 0 or an error.
