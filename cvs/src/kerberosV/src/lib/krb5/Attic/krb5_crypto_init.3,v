@update kerberosV to Heimdal 1.5.2 using BSD Makefiles based
on the ones from FreeBSD

This is getting commited now so that we can patch it up
fast in the tree.
There are known regressions so please don't try to build
this on your own now, please wait for the next available
snapshot.

If however you would still want to build it, make sure
build and install everything in the tools directory first.

This is not the full commit yet because there are several
subdirectories.

Kerberos 5 Library (libkrb5, -lkrb5)
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In krb5.h

.Sh DESCRIPTION
Heimdal exports parts of the Kerberos crypto interface for applications.
.Pp
Each kerberos encrytion/checksum function takes a crypto context.
.Pp
To setup and destroy crypto contextes there are two functions
.Fn krb5_crypto_init
and
.Fn krb5_crypto_destroy .
The encryption type to use is taken from the key, but can be overridden
with the
.Fa enctype parameter .
This can be useful for encryptions types which is compatiable (DES for
example).

The

.Fa crypto .
The
.Fa key
parameter is the key to use for encryption, and checksums. The
