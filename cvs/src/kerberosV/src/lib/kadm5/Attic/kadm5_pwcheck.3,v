@The complexity and quality of kerberosV and the fact that almost
nobody is using it doesn't justify to have it in base - disable and
remove it.  If the 2 two people who use it still want it, they can
make a port or recompile OpenBSD on their own.

There is a quote in theo.c from August 2010: "basically, dung beetles
fucking.  that's what kerberosV + openssl is like".

Discussed with many.  Tests by henning@@ reyk@@ and others.

.Sh DESCRIPTION
These functions perform the quality check for the heimdal database
library.
.Pp
There are two versions of the shared object API; the old version (0)
is deprecated, but still supported.  The new version (1) supports
multiple password quality checking policies in the same shared object.
See below for details.
.Pp
The password quality checker will run all policies that are
configured by the user.  If any policy rejects the password, the password
will be rejected.
.Pp
Policy names are of the form
.Ql module-name:policy-name
or, if the the policy name is unique enough, just
.Ql policy-name .
.Sh IMPLEMENTING A PASSWORD QUALITY CHECKING SHARED OBJECT
(This refers to the version 1 API only.)
.Pp
Module shared objects may conveniently be compiled and linked with
.Xr libtool 1 .
An object needs to export a symbol called
.Ql kadm5_password_verifier
of the type
.Ft "struct kadm5_pw_policy_verifier" .
.Pp
Its
.Ft name
and
.Ft vendor
fields should contain the obvious information.
.Ft name
must match the
.Ql module-name
portion of the policy name (the part before the colon), if the policy name
contains a colon, or the policy will not be run.
.Ft version
should be
.Dv KADM5_PASSWD_VERSION_V1 .
.Pp
.Ft funcs
contains an array of
.Ft "struct kadm5_pw_policy_check_func"
structures that is terminated with an entry whose
.Ft name
component is
.Dv NULL .
The
.Ft name
field of the array must match the
.Ql policy-name
portion of a policy name (the part after the colon, or the complete policy
name if there is no colon) specified by the user or the policy will not be
run.  The
.Ft func
fields of the array elements are functions that are exported by the
module to be called to check the password.  They get the following
arguments:  the Kerberos context, principal, password, a tuning parameter, and
a pointer to a message buffer and its length.  The tuning parameter
for the quality check function is currently always
.Dv NULL .
If the password is acceptable, the function returns zero.  Otherwise
it returns non-zero and fills in the message buffer with an
appropriate explanation.
.Sh RUNNING THE CHECKS
.Nm kadm5_setup_passwd_quality_check
sets up type 0 checks.  It sets up all type 0 checks defined in
.Xr krb5.conf 5
if called with the last two arguments null.
.Pp
.Nm kadm5_add_passwd_quality_verifier
sets up type 1 checks.  It sets up all type 1 tests defined in
.Xr krb5.conf 5
if called with a null second argument.
.Nm kadm5_check_password_quality
runs the checks in the order in which they are defined in
.Xr krb5.conf 5
and the order in which they occur in a
module's
.Ft funcs
array until one returns non-zero.

@update kerberosV to Heimdal 1.5.2 using BSD Makefiles based
on the ones from FreeBSD

This is getting commited now so that we can patch it up
fast in the tree.
There are known regressions so please don't try to build
this on your own now, please wait for the next available
snapshot.

If however you would still want to build it, make sure
build and install everything in the tools directory first.

This is not the full commit yet because there are several
subdirectories.
