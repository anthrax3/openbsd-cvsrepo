@The complexity and quality of kerberosV and the fact that almost
nobody is using it doesn't justify to have it in base - disable and
remove it.  If the 2 two people who use it still want it, they can
make a port or recompile OpenBSD on their own.

There is a quote in theo.c from August 2010: "basically, dung beetles
fucking.  that's what kerberosV + openssl is like".

Discussed with many.  Tests by henning@@ reyk@@ and others.

.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm ipropd-master
is used to propagate changes to a Heimdal Kerberos database from the
master Kerberos server on which it runs to slave Kerberos servers
running
.Nm ipropd-slave .
.Pp
The slaves are specified by the contents of the
.Pa slaves
file in the KDC's database directory, e.g.\&
.Pa /var/heimdal/slaves .
This has principals one per-line of the form
.Dl iprop/ Ns Ar slave Ns @@ Ns Ar REALM
where
.Ar slave
is the hostname of the slave server in the given
.Ar REALM ,
e.g.\&
.Dl iprop/kerberos-1.example.com@@EXAMPLE.COM
On a slave, the argument
.Fa master
specifies the hostname of the master server from which to receive updates.
.Pp
In contrast to
.Xr hprop 8 ,
which sends the whole database to the slaves regularly,
.Nm
normally sends only the changes as they happen on the master.
The master keeps track of all the changes by assigning a version
number to every change to the database.
The slaves know which was the latest version they saw, and in this
way it can be determined if they are in sync or not.
A log of all the changes is kept on the master.
When a slave is at an older version than the oldest one in the log,
the whole database has to be sent.
.Pp
The changes are propagated over a secure channel (on port 2121 by
default).
This should normally be defined as
.Dq iprop/tcp
in
.Pa /etc/services
or another source of the services database.
The master and slaves
must each have access to a keytab with keys for the
.Nm iprop
service principal on the local host.
.Pp
There is a keep-alive feature logged in the master's
.Pa slave-stats
file (e.g.\&
.Pa /var/heimdal/slave-stats ) .
.Pp
Supported options for
.Nm ipropd-master :
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl c Ar string , Fl Fl config-file= Ns Ar string
.It Fl r Ar string , Fl Fl realm= Ns Ar string
.It Fl k Ar kspec , Fl Fl keytab= Ns Ar kspec
keytab to get authentication from
.It Fl d Ar file , Fl Fl database= Ns Ar file
Database (default per KDC)
.It Fl Fl slave-stats-file= Ns Ar file
file for slave status information
.It Fl Fl time-missing= Ns Ar time
time before slave is polled for presence (default 2 min)
.It Fl Fl time-gone= Ns Ar time
time of inactivity after which a slave is considered gone (default 5 min)
.It Fl Fl detach

@update kerberosV to Heimdal 1.5.2 using BSD Makefiles based
on the ones from FreeBSD

This is getting commited now so that we can patch it up
fast in the tree.
There are known regressions so please don't try to build
this on your own now, please wait for the next available
snapshot.

If however you would still want to build it, make sure
build and install everything in the tools directory first.

This is not the full commit yet because there are several
subdirectories.
