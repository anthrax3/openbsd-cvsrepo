@The complexity and quality of kerberosV and the fact that almost
nobody is using it doesn't justify to have it in base - disable and
remove it.  If the 2 two people who use it still want it, they can
make a port or recompile OpenBSD on their own.

There is a quote in theo.c from August 2010: "basically, dung beetles
fucking.  that's what kerberosV + openssl is like".

Discussed with many.  Tests by henning@@ reyk@@ and others.

@update kerberosV to Heimdal 1.5.2 using BSD Makefiles based
on the ones from FreeBSD

This is getting commited now so that we can patch it up
fast in the tree.
There are known regressions so please don't try to build
this on your own now, please wait for the next available
snapshot.

If however you would still want to build it, make sure
build and install everything in the tools directory first.

This is not the full commit yet because there are several
subdirectories.

* configure

use more careful checking before starting to use berkeley db.  it only
makes sense to do so if we have the appropriate library and the header
file.

handle readline hiding in readline/readline.h

* appl

** appl/popper

Implement RFC1731 and 1734, pop over GSS-API

* doc

* kdc

* kadmin

make it happy with reading and parsing kdc.conf

is in need of a major cleanup

* kpasswdd

figure out what's the deal with do_sequence and the MIT client

* lib

** lib/asn1

prepend a prefix on all generated symbols

** lib/auth

rewrite the lookup of KDCs to handle kerberos-<n> and not do any DNS
requests if the information can be found locally.  this requires stop
using krb5_get_krbhst.

the replay cache is, in its current state, not very useful

always generates a new subkey in an authenticator

should the sequence numbers be XORed?

OTP?

make checksum/encryption type configuration more realm-specific.  make
