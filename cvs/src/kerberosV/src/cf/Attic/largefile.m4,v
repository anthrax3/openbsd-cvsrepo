@The complexity and quality of kerberosV and the fact that almost
nobody is using it doesn't justify to have it in base - disable and
remove it.  If the 2 two people who use it still want it, they can
make a port or recompile OpenBSD on their own.

There is a quote in theo.c from August 2010: "basically, dung beetles
fucking.  that's what kerberosV + openssl is like".

Discussed with many.  Tests by henning@@ reyk@@ and others.

dnl Figure out what flags we need for 64-bit file access, and also set
dnl them on the command line.
dnl
AC_DEFUN([rk_SYS_LARGEFILE],[
AC_REQUIRE([AC_SYS_LARGEFILE])dnl
dnl need to set this on the command line, since it might otherwise break
dnl with generated code, such as lex
if test "$enable_largefile" != no -a "$ac_cv_sys_large_files" != no; then
	CPPFLAGS="$CPPFLAGS -D_LARGE_FILES=$ac_cv_sys_large_files"

@update kerberosV to Heimdal 1.5.2 using BSD Makefiles based
on the ones from FreeBSD

This is getting commited now so that we can patch it up
fast in the tree.
There are known regressions so please don't try to build
this on your own now, please wait for the next available
snapshot.

If however you would still want to build it, make sure
build and install everything in the tools directory first.

This is not the full commit yet because there are several
subdirectories.
