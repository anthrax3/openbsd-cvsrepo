@The complexity and quality of kerberosV and the fact that almost
nobody is using it doesn't justify to have it in base - disable and
remove it.  If the 2 two people who use it still want it, they can
make a port or recompile OpenBSD on their own.

There is a quote in theo.c from August 2010: "basically, dung beetles
fucking.  that's what kerberosV + openssl is like".

Discussed with many.  Tests by henning@@ reyk@@ and others.

LOGIN.ACCESS(5)             BSD File Formats Manual            LOGIN.ACCESS(5)

NNAAMMEE
     llooggiinn..aacccceessss -- login access control table

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     The llooggiinn..aacccceessss file specifies on which ttys or from which hosts certain
     users are allowed to login.

     At login, the _/_e_t_c_/_l_o_g_i_n_._a_c_c_e_s_s file is checked for the first entry that
     matches a specific user/host or user/tty combination. That entry can
     either allow or deny login access to that user.

     Each entry have three fields separated by colon:

     ++oo   The first field indicates the permission given if the entry matches.
         It can be either ``+'' (allow access) or ``-'' (deny access) .

     ++oo   The second field is a comma separated list of users or groups for
         which the current entry applies. NIS netgroups can used (if config-
         ured) if preceeded by @@. The magic string ALL matches all users.  A
         group will match if the user is a member of that group, or it is the
         user's primary group.

     ++oo   The third field is a list of ttys, or network names. A network name
         can be either a hostname, a domain (indicated by a starting period),
         or a netgroup. As with the user list, ALL matches anything. LOCAL
         matches a string not containing a period.

     If the string EXCEPT is found in either the user or from list, the rest
     of the list are exceptions to the list before EXCEPT.

BBUUGGSS
     If there's a user and a group with the same name, there is no way to make
     the group match if the user also matches.

@update kerberosV to Heimdal 1.5.2 using BSD Makefiles based
on the ones from FreeBSD

This is getting commited now so that we can patch it up
fast in the tree.
There are known regressions so please don't try to build
this on your own now, please wait for the next available
snapshot.

If however you would still want to build it, make sure
build and install everything in the tools directory first.

This is not the full commit yet because there are several
subdirectories.
