@The complexity and quality of kerberosV and the fact that almost
nobody is using it doesn't justify to have it in base - disable and
remove it.  If the 2 two people who use it still want it, they can
make a port or recompile OpenBSD on their own.

There is a quote in theo.c from August 2010: "basically, dung beetles
fucking.  that's what kerberosV + openssl is like".

Discussed with many.  Tests by henning@@ reyk@@ and others.

.Sh NAME
.Nm kxd
.Nd securely forward X conections
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Ar kxd
.Op Fl t
.Op Fl i
.Op Fl p Ar port
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This is the daemon for
.Nm kx .
.Pp
Options supported by
.Nm kxd :
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl t
TCP.  Normally
.Nm kxd
will only listen for X connections on a UNIX socket, but some machines
(for example, Cray) have X libraries that are not able to use UNIX
sockets and thus you need to use TCP to talk to the pseudo-xserver
created by
.Nm kxd .
This option decreases the security significantly and should only be
used when it is necessary and you have considered the consequences of
doing so.
.It Fl i
Interactive.  Do not expect to be started by
.Nm inetd ,
but allocate and listen to the socket yourself.  Handy for testing
and debugging.
.It Fl p
Port.  Listen on the port
.Ar port .
Only usable with
.Fl i .
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
Put the following in
.Pa /etc/inetd.conf :
.Bd -literal
kx	stream	tcp	nowait	root	/usr/athena/libexec/kxd	kxd
.Ed

@2nd part of:
update kerberosV to Heimdal 1.5.2 using BSD Makefiles based
on the ones from FreeBSD

This is getting commited now so that we can patch it up
fast in the tree.
There are known regressions so please don't try to build
this on your own now, please wait for the next available
snapshot.

If however you would still want to build it, make sure
build and install everything in the tools directory first.
