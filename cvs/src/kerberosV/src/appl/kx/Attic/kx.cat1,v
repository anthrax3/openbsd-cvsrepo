@The complexity and quality of kerberosV and the fact that almost
nobody is using it doesn't justify to have it in base - disable and
remove it.  If the 2 two people who use it still want it, they can
make a port or recompile OpenBSD on their own.

There is a quote in theo.c from August 2010: "basically, dung beetles
fucking.  that's what kerberosV + openssl is like".

Discussed with many.  Tests by henning@@ reyk@@ and others.

     The kkxx program forwards an X connection from a remote client to a local
     screen through an authenticated and encrypted stream.  Options supported
     by kkxx:

     --ll      Log in on the remote the host as user _u_s_e_r_n_a_m_e.

     --kk      Do not enable keep-alives on the TCP connections.

     --dd      Do not fork. This is mainly useful for debugging.

     --tt      Listen not only on a UNIX-domain socket but on a TCP socket as
             well.

     --pp      Use the port _p_o_r_t.

     --PP      Force passive mode.

     This program is used by rrxxtteellnneett and rrxxtteerrmm and you should not need to
     run it directly.

     It connects to a kkxxdd on the host _h_o_s_t and then will relay the traffic
     from the remote X clients to the local server.  When started, it prints
     the display and Xauthority-file to be used on host _h_o_s_t and then goes to
     the background, waiting for connections from the remote kkxxdd.

@2nd part of:
update kerberosV to Heimdal 1.5.2 using BSD Makefiles based
on the ones from FreeBSD

This is getting commited now so that we can patch it up
fast in the tree.
There are known regressions so please don't try to build
this on your own now, please wait for the next available
snapshot.

If however you would still want to build it, make sure
build and install everything in the tools directory first.

@Import of heimdal-0.3f

Lots of changes, highlights include:

 * change default keytab to ANY:FILE:/etc/krb5.keytab,krb4:/etc/srvtab,
   the new keytab type that tries both of these in order (SRVTAB is
   also an alias for krb4:)

 * improve error reporting and error handling (error messages should
   be more detailed and more useful)

 * the API is closer to what MIT krb5 is using

 * more compatible with windows 2000

 * removed some memory leaks

 * bug fixes
