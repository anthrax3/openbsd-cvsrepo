@The complexity and quality of kerberosV and the fact that almost
nobody is using it doesn't justify to have it in base - disable and
remove it.  If the 2 two people who use it still want it, they can
make a port or recompile OpenBSD on their own.

There is a quote in theo.c from August 2010: "basically, dung beetles
fucking.  that's what kerberosV + openssl is like".

Discussed with many.  Tests by henning@@ reyk@@ and others.

.El
.Pp
This program is used by
.Nm rxtelnet
and
.Nm rxterm
and you should not need to run it directly.
.Pp
It connects to a
.Nm kxd
on the host
.Ar host
and then will relay the traffic from the remote X clients to the local
server.  When started, it prints the display and Xauthority-file to be
used on host
.Ar host
and then goes to the background, waiting for connections from the
remote
.Nm kxd .

@2nd part of:
update kerberosV to Heimdal 1.5.2 using BSD Makefiles based
on the ones from FreeBSD

This is getting commited now so that we can patch it up
fast in the tree.
There are known regressions so please don't try to build
this on your own now, please wait for the next available
snapshot.

If however you would still want to build it, make sure
build and install everything in the tools directory first.
