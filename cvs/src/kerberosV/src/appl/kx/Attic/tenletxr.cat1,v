@The complexity and quality of kerberosV and the fact that almost
nobody is using it doesn't justify to have it in base - disable and
remove it.  If the 2 two people who use it still want it, they can
make a port or recompile OpenBSD on their own.

There is a quote in theo.c from August 2010: "basically, dung beetles
fucking.  that's what kerberosV + openssl is like".

Discussed with many.  Tests by henning@@ reyk@@ and others.

     The tteennlleettxxrr program enables forwarding of X-connections from this
     machine to host _h_o_s_t.  If _p_o_r_t is given, that port will be used instead
     of the default.

     The supported options are:

     --ll      Log in on the remote host as user _u_s_e_r_n_a_m_e

     --kk      Disables keep-alives.

EEXXAAMMPPLLEE
     To login from host _f_o_o to host _b_a_r (where your display is), you might do
     the following.

     1.   On foo: tteennlleettxxrr _b_a_r

     2.   You will get a new shell where you will be able to start X clients
          that will show their windows on _b_a_r.

     It currently checks if you have permission to run it by checking if you
     own _/_d_e_v_/_c_o_n_s_o_l_e on the remote host.

@2nd part of:
update kerberosV to Heimdal 1.5.2 using BSD Makefiles based
on the ones from FreeBSD

This is getting commited now so that we can patch it up
fast in the tree.
There are known regressions so please don't try to build
this on your own now, please wait for the next available
snapshot.

If however you would still want to build it, make sure
build and install everything in the tools directory first.

@Import of heimdal-0.3f

Lots of changes, highlights include:

 * change default keytab to ANY:FILE:/etc/krb5.keytab,krb4:/etc/srvtab,
   the new keytab type that tries both of these in order (SRVTAB is
   also an alias for krb4:)

 * improve error reporting and error handling (error messages should
   be more detailed and more useful)

 * the API is closer to what MIT krb5 is using

 * more compatible with windows 2000

 * removed some memory leaks

 * bug fixes
