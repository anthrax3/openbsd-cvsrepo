@The complexity and quality of kerberosV and the fact that almost
nobody is using it doesn't justify to have it in base - disable and
remove it.  If the 2 two people who use it still want it, they can
make a port or recompile OpenBSD on their own.

There is a quote in theo.c from August 2010: "basically, dung beetles
fucking.  that's what kerberosV + openssl is like".

Discussed with many.  Tests by henning@@ reyk@@ and others.

     ppooppppeerr serves mail via the Post Office Protocol.  Supported options
     include:

     --aa _p_l_a_i_n_t_e_x_t|_o_t_p|_s_a_s_l
             Tells ppooppppeerr which authentication mode is acceptable, _s_a_s_l
             enables SASL (RFC2222),  and _o_t_p enables OTP (RFC1938) authenti-
             cation. Both disable plaintext passwords.

     ----aaddddrreessss--lloogg==_f_i_l_e
             Logs the addresses (along with a timestamp) of all clients to the
             specified file. This can be used to implement POP-before-SMTP
             authentication.

     --dd      Enables more verbose log messages.

     --ii      When not started by inetd, this flag tells ppooppppeerr that it has to
             create a socket by itself.

     --kk      Tells ppooppppeerr to use Kerberos for authentication. This is the tra-
             ditional way of doing Kerberos authentication, and is normally
             done on a separate port (as it doesn't follow RFC1939), and
             should be used instead of using SASL.

     --pp _p_o_r_t
             Port to listen to, in combination with --ii.

     --tt _f_i_l_e
             Trace all commands to file.

     --TT _s_e_c_o_n_d_s
             Set timeout to something other than the default of 120 seconds.

     The server was initially developed at the University of California,
     Berkeley.

     Many changes have been made as part of the KTH Kerberos distributions.

@update kerberosV to Heimdal 1.5.2 using BSD Makefiles based
on the ones from FreeBSD

This is getting commited now so that we can patch it up
fast in the tree.
There are known regressions so please don't try to build
this on your own now, please wait for the next available
snapshot.

If however you would still want to build it, make sure
build and install everything in the tools directory first.

This is not the full commit yet because there are several
subdirectories.
