@The complexity and quality of kerberosV and the fact that almost
nobody is using it doesn't justify to have it in base - disable and
remove it.  If the 2 two people who use it still want it, they can
make a port or recompile OpenBSD on their own.

There is a quote in theo.c from August 2010: "basically, dung beetles
fucking.  that's what kerberosV + openssl is like".

Discussed with many.  Tests by henning@@ reyk@@ and others.

.Sh NAME
.Nm rcp
.Nd copy file to and from remote machines
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm rcp
.Op Fl 45FKpxz
.Op Fl P Ar port
.Ar file1 file2
.Nm rcp
.Op Fl 45FKprxz
.Op Fl P Ar port
.Ar file... directory
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm rcp
copies files between machines. Each file argument is either a remote file name of the form
.Dq rname@@rhost:path
or a local file (containing no colon or with a slash before the first
colon).
.Pp
Supported options:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Xo
.Fl 4 ,
.Fl 5 ,
.Fl K ,
.Fl F ,
.Fl x ,
.Fl z
.Xc
These options are passed on to
.Xr rsh 1 .
.It Fl P Ar port
This will pass the option
.Fl p Ar port
to
.Xr rsh 1 .
.It Fl p
Preserve file permissions.
.It Fl r
Copy source directories recursively.
.El
.\".Sh ENVIRONMENT
.\".Sh FILES
.\".Sh EXAMPLES
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Nm rcp
is implemented as a protocol on top of
.Xr rsh 1 ,
and thus requires a working rsh. If you intend to use Kerberos
authentication, rsh needs to be Kerberos aware, else you may see more
or less strange errors, such as "login incorrect", or "lost
connection".
.\".Sh SEE ALSO
.\".Sh STANDARDS
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm rcp
utility first appeared in 4.2BSD. This version is derived from
4.3BSD-Reno.

@2nd part of:
update kerberosV to Heimdal 1.5.2 using BSD Makefiles based
on the ones from FreeBSD

This is getting commited now so that we can patch it up
fast in the tree.
There are known regressions so please don't try to build
this on your own now, please wait for the next available
snapshot.

If however you would still want to build it, make sure
build and install everything in the tools directory first.
