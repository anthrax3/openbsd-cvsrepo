@The complexity and quality of kerberosV and the fact that almost
nobody is using it doesn't justify to have it in base - disable and
remove it.  If the 2 two people who use it still want it, they can
make a port or recompile OpenBSD on their own.

There is a quote in theo.c from August 2010: "basically, dung beetles
fucking.  that's what kerberosV + openssl is like".

Discussed with many.  Tests by henning@@ reyk@@ and others.

     rrccpp copies files between machines. Each file argument is either a remote
     file name of the form ``rname@@rhost:path'' or a local file (containing no
     colon or with a slash before the first colon).

     Supported options:

     --44, --55, --KK, --FF, --xx, --zz
             These options are passed on to rsh(1).

     --PP _p_o_r_t
             This will pass the option --pp _p_o_r_t to rsh(1).

     --pp      Preserve file permissions.

     --rr      Copy source directories recursively.

DDIIAAGGNNOOSSTTIICCSS
     rrccpp is implemented as a protocol on top of rsh(1), and thus requires a
     working rsh. If you intend to use Kerberos authentication, rsh needs to
     be Kerberos aware, else you may see more or less strange errors, such as
     "login incorrect", or "lost connection".

HHIISSTTOORRYY
     The rrccpp utility first appeared in 4.2BSD. This version is derived from
     4.3BSD-Reno.

@2nd part of:
update kerberosV to Heimdal 1.5.2 using BSD Makefiles based
on the ones from FreeBSD

This is getting commited now so that we can patch it up
fast in the tree.
There are known regressions so please don't try to build
this on your own now, please wait for the next available
snapshot.

If however you would still want to build it, make sure
build and install everything in the tools directory first.
