@The complexity and quality of kerberosV and the fact that almost
nobody is using it doesn't justify to have it in base - disable and
remove it.  If the 2 two people who use it still want it, they can
make a port or recompile OpenBSD on their own.

There is a quote in theo.c from August 2010: "basically, dung beetles
fucking.  that's what kerberosV + openssl is like".

Discussed with many.  Tests by henning@@ reyk@@ and others.

.Op Ar cell | path ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
obtains AFS tokens for a number of cells. What cells to get tokens for
can either be specified as an explicit list, as file paths to get
tokens for, or be left unspecified, in which case
.Nm
will use whatever magic
.Xr krb_afslog 3
decides upon.
.Pp
Supported options:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl Fl no-v4
This makes
.Nm
not try using Kerberos 4.
.It Fl Fl no-v5
This makes
.Nm
not try using Kerberos 5.
.It Xo
.Fl P Ar principal ,
.Fl Fl principal Ar principal
.Xc
select what Kerberos 5 principal to use.
.It Fl Fl cache Ar cache
select what Kerberos 5 credential cache to use.
.Fl Fl principal
overrides this option.
.It Xo
.Fl u ,
.Fl Fl unlog
.Xc
Destroy tokens instead of obtaining new. If this is specified, all
other options are ignored (except for
.Fl Fl help
and
.Fl Fl version ) .
.It Xo
.Fl v ,
.Fl Fl verbose
.Xc
Adds more verbosity for what is actually going on.
.It Xo
.Fl c Ar cell,
.Fl Fl cell= Ns Ar cell
.Xc
This specified one or more cell names to get tokens for.
.It Xo
.Fl k Ar realm ,
.Fl Fl realm= Ns Ar realm
.Xc
This is the Kerberos realm the AFS servers live in, this should
normally not be specified.
.It Xo
.Fl p Ar path ,
.Fl Fl file= Ns Ar path
.Xc
This specified one or more file paths for which tokens should be
obtained.
.El
.Pp
Instead of using
.Fl c
and
.Fl p ,
you may also pass a list of cells and file paths after any other
options. These arguments are considered files if they are either
the strings
.Do . Dc
or
.Dq ..
or they contain a slash, or if there exists a file by that name.
.Sh EXAMPLES
Assuming that there is no file called
.Dq openafs.org
in the current directory, and that
.Pa /afs/openafs.org
points to that cell, the follwing should be identical:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ afslog -c openafs.org
$ afslog openafs.org
$ afslog /afs/openafs.org/some/file

@update kerberosV to Heimdal 1.5.2 using BSD Makefiles based
on the ones from FreeBSD

This is getting commited now so that we can patch it up
fast in the tree.
There are known regressions so please don't try to build
this on your own now, please wait for the next available
snapshot.

If however you would still want to build it, make sure
build and install everything in the tools directory first.

This is not the full commit yet because there are several
subdirectories.
