@The complexity and quality of kerberosV and the fact that almost
nobody is using it doesn't justify to have it in base - disable and
remove it.  If the 2 two people who use it still want it, they can
make a port or recompile OpenBSD on their own.

There is a quote in theo.c from August 2010: "basically, dung beetles
fucking.  that's what kerberosV + openssl is like".

Discussed with many.  Tests by henning@@ reyk@@ and others.

       xnlock - amusing lock screen program with message for passers-by

SSYYNNOOPPSSIISS
       xxnnlloocckk [ _o_p_t_i_o_n_s ] [ _m_e_s_s_a_g_e ]

       _x_n_l_o_c_k  is  a program that acts as a screen saver for workstations run-
       ning X11.  It also "locks" the screen such that the workstation can  be
       left  unattended without worry that someone else will walk up to it and
       mess everything up.  When _x_n_l_o_c_k is running, a little man  with  a  big
       nose  and  a  hat  runs  around spewing out messages to the screen.  By
       default, the messages are "humorous", but that depends on your sense of
       humor.

       If a key or mouse button is pressed, a prompt is printed requesting the
       user's password.  If a RETURN is not typed within 30 seconds, the  lit-
       tle man resumes running around.

       Text on the command line is used as the message.  For example:
            % xnlock I'm out to lunch for a couple of hours.
       Note the need to quote shell metacharacters.

       In the absence of flags or text, _x_n_l_o_c_k displays random fortunes.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       Command  line  options override all resource specifications.  All argu-
       ments that are not associated with a command line option is taken to be
       message text that the little man will "say" every once in a while.  The
       resource xxnnlloocckk..tteexxtt may be set to a string.

       --ffnn _f_o_n_t_n_a_m_e
              The default font is the first 18 point font in the  _n_e_w  _c_e_n_t_u_r_y
              _s_c_h_o_o_l_b_o_o_k  family.   While  larger  fonts are recokmmended over
              smaller ones, any font in the server's font list will work.  The
              resource to use for this option is xxnnlloocckk..ffoonntt.

       --ffiilleennaammee  _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e
              Take  the  message  to  be displayed from the file _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e.  If
              _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e is not specified, _$_H_O_M_E_/_._m_s_g_f_i_l_e is used.  If the  con-
              tents  of  the  file are changed during runtime, the most recent
              text of the file is used (allowing the displayed message  to  be
              altered   remotely).   Carriage  returns  within  the  text  are
              allowed, but tabs or other control characters are not translated
              and  should not be used.  The resource available for this option
              is xxnnlloocckk..ffiillee.

       --aarr    Accept root's password to unlock screen.  This option is true by
              default.  The reason for this is so that someone's screen may be
              unlocked by autorized users in case of emergency and the  person
              running  the program is still out to lunch.  The resource avail-
              able for specifying this option is xxnnlloocckk..aacccceeppttRRoooottPPaasssswwdd.

       --nnooaarr  Don't accept root's password.  This option is for paranoids  who
              fear  their peers might breakin using root's password and remove
              their files anyway.  Specifying this option on the command  line
              overrides the xxnnlloocckk..aacccceeppttRRoooottPPaasssswwdd if set to True.

       --iipp    Ignore  password prompt.  The resource available for this option
              is xxnnlloocckk..iiggnnoorreePPaasssswwdd.

       --nnooiipp  Don't ignore password prompt.  This is  available  in  order  to
              override the resource iiggnnoorreePPaasssswwdd if set to True.

       --ffgg _c_o_l_o_r
              Specifies the foreground color.  The resource available for this
              is xxnnlloocckk..ffoorreeggrroouunndd.

       --bbgg _c_o_l_o_r

DESCRIPTION
  _x_n_l_o_c_k is a program that acts as a screen saver for workstations running
  X11.  It also "locks" the screen such that the workstation can be left
  unattended without worry that someone else will walk up to it and mess
  everything up.  When _x_n_l_o_c_k is running, a little man with a big nose and a
  hat runs around spewing out messages to the screen.  By default, the mes-
  sages are "humorous", but that depends on your sense of humor.

  If a key or mouse button is pressed, a prompt is printed requesting the
  user's password.  If a RETURN is not typed within 30 seconds, the little
  man resumes running around.

  Text on the command line is used as the message.  For example:

@Import of heimdal-0.3f

Lots of changes, highlights include:

 * change default keytab to ANY:FILE:/etc/krb5.keytab,krb4:/etc/srvtab,
   the new keytab type that tries both of these in order (SRVTAB is
   also an alias for krb4:)

 * improve error reporting and error handling (error messages should
   be more detailed and more useful)

 * the API is closer to what MIT krb5 is using

 * more compatible with windows 2000

 * removed some memory leaks

 * bug fixes
