@The complexity and quality of kerberosV and the fact that almost
nobody is using it doesn't justify to have it in base - disable and
remove it.  If the 2 two people who use it still want it, they can
make a port or recompile OpenBSD on their own.

There is a quote in theo.c from August 2010: "basically, dung beetles
fucking.  that's what kerberosV + openssl is like".

Discussed with many.  Tests by henning@@ reyk@@ and others.

   Three pieces of state need to be kept for each side of each option.
   (You need the localside, sending WILL/WONT & receiving DO/DONT, and
   the remoteside, sending DO/DONT and receiving WILL/WONT)

	MY_STATE:	What state am I in?
	WANT_STATE:	What state do I want?
	WANT_RESP:	How many requests have I initiated?

   Default values:
	MY_STATE = WANT_STATE = DONT
	WANT_RESP = 0

   The local setup will change based on the state of the Telnet
   variables.  When we are the originator, we can either make the
   local setup changes at option request time (in which case if
   the option is denied we need to change things back) or when
   the option is acknowledged.

   To initiate a switch to NEW_STATE:

	if ((WANT_RESP == 0 && NEW_STATE == MY_STATE) ||
			WANT_STATE == NEW_STATE) {
	    do nothing;
	} else {
	    /*
	     * This is where the logic goes to change the local setup
	     * if we are doing so at request initiation
	     */
	    WANT_STATE = NEW_STATE;
	    send NEW_STATE;
	    WANT_RESP += 1;
	}

   When receiving NEW_STATE:

	if (WANT_RESP) {
	    --WANT_RESP;
	    if (WANT_RESP && (NEW_STATE == MY_STATE))
		--WANT_RESP;
	}
	if (WANT_RESP == 0) {
	    if (NEW_STATE != WANT_STATE) {
		/*
		 * This is where the logic goes to decide if it is ok
		 * to switch to NEW_STATE, and if so, do any necessary
		 * local setup changes.
		 */
		if (ok_to_switch_to NEW_STATE)
		    WANT_STATE = NEW_STATE;
		else
		    WANT_RESP++;
*		if (MY_STATE != WANT_STATE)
		    reply with WANT_STATE;
	    } else {
		/*
		 * This is where the logic goes to change the local setup
		 * if we are doing so at request acknowledgment
		 */
	    }
	}
	MY_STATE = NEW_STATE;

* This if() line is not needed, it should be ok to always do the
  "reply with WANT_STATE".  With the if() line, asking to turn on
  an option that the other side doesn't understand is:
		Send DO option
		Recv WONT option
  Without the if() line, it is:
		Send DO option
		Recv WONT option
		Send DONT option
  If the other side does not expect to receive the latter case,
  but generates the latter case, then there is a potential for
  option negotiation loops.  An implementation that does not expect
  to get the second case should not generate it, an implementation
  that does expect to get it may or may not generate it, and things
  will still work.  Being conservative in what we send, we have the
  if() statement in, but we expect the other side to generate the
  last response.

@2nd part of:
update kerberosV to Heimdal 1.5.2 using BSD Makefiles based
on the ones from FreeBSD

This is getting commited now so that we can patch it up
fast in the tree.
There are known regressions so please don't try to build
this on your own now, please wait for the next available
snapshot.

If however you would still want to build it, make sure
build and install everything in the tools directory first.

@These files are not use by us, so they're removed to make the tree
a little bit leaner, and to get rid of some bad string functions.
