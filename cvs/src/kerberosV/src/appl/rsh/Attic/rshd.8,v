@The complexity and quality of kerberosV and the fact that almost
nobody is using it doesn't justify to have it in base - disable and
remove it.  If the 2 two people who use it still want it, they can
make a port or recompile OpenBSD on their own.

There is a quote in theo.c from August 2010: "basically, dung beetles
fucking.  that's what kerberosV + openssl is like".

Discussed with many.  Tests by henning@@ reyk@@ and others.

.Dt RSHD 8
.Os HEIMDAL
.Sh NAME
.Nm rshd
.Nd remote shell server
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl aiklnvxPL
.Op Fl p Ar port
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is the server for
the
.Xr rsh 1
program. It provides an authenticated remote command execution
service.  Supported options are:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Xo
.Fl n ,
.Fl Fl no-keepalive
.Xc
Disables keep-alive messages.
Keep-alives are packets sent at certain intervals to make sure that the
client is still there, even when it doesn't send any data.
.It Xo
.Fl k ,
.Fl Fl kerberos
.Xc
Assume that clients connecting to this server will use some form of
Kerberos authentication. See the
.Sx EXAMPLES
section for a sample
.Xr inetd.conf 5
configuration.
.It Xo
.Fl x ,
.Fl Fl encrypt
.Xc
For Kerberos 4 this means that the connections are encrypted. Kerberos
5 can negotiate encryption even without this option, but if it's
present
.Nm
will deny unencrypted connections. This option implies
.Fl k .
.\".It Xo
.\".Fl l ,
.\".Fl Fl no-rhosts
.\".Xc
.\"When using old port-based authentication, the user's
.\".Pa .rhosts
.\"files are normally checked. This option disables this.
.It Xo
.Fl v ,
.Fl Fl vacuous
.Xc
If the connecting client does not use any Kerberised authentication,
print a message that complains about this fact, and exit. This is
helpful if you want to move away from old port-based authentication.
.It Xo
.Fl P
.Xc
When using the AFS filesystem, users' authentication tokens are put in
something called a PAG (Process Authentication Group). Multiple
processes can share a PAG, but normally each login session has its own
PAG. This option disables the
.Fn setpag
call, so all tokens will be put in the default (uid-based) PAG, making
it possible to share tokens between sessions. This is only useful in
peculiar environments, such as some batch systems.
.It Xo
.Fl i ,
.Fl Fl no-inetd
.Xc
The
.Fl i
option will cause
.Nm
to create a socket, instead of assuming that its stdin came from
.Xr inetd 8 .
This is mostly useful for debugging.
.It Xo
.Fl p Ar port ,
.Fl Fl port= Ns Ar port
.Xc
Port to use with
.Fl i .
.It Xo
.Fl a
.Xc
This flag is for backwards compatibility only.
.It Xo
.Fl L
.Xc
This flag enables logging of connections to
.Xr syslogd 8 .
This option is always on in this implementation.
.El
.\".Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /etc/hosts.equiv -compact
.It Pa /etc/hosts.equiv
.It Pa ~/.rhosts
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following can be used to enable Kerberised rsh in
.Xr inetd.cond 5 ,
while disabling non-Kerberised connections:
.Bd -literal
shell   stream  tcp  nowait  root  /usr/libexec/rshd  rshd -v
kshell  stream  tcp  nowait  root  /usr/libexec/rshd  rshd -k
ekshell stream  tcp  nowait  root  /usr/libexec/rshd  rshd -kx
.Ed
.\".Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr rsh 1 ,
.Xr iruserok 3
.\".Sh STANDARDS
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command appeared in
.Bx 4.2 .
.Sh AUTHORS
This implementation of
.Nm
was written as part of the Heimdal Kerberos 5 implementation.

log
@2nd part of:
update kerberosV to Heimdal 1.5.2 using BSD Makefiles based
on the ones from FreeBSD

This is getting commited now so that we can patch it up
fast in the tree.
There are known regressions so please don't try to build
this on your own now, please wait for the next available
snapshot.

If however you would still want to build it, make sure
build and install everything in the tools directory first.
