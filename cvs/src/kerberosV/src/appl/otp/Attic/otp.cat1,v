@The complexity and quality of kerberosV and the fact that almost
nobody is using it doesn't justify to have it in base - disable and
remove it.  If the 2 two people who use it still want it, they can
make a port or recompile OpenBSD on their own.

There is a quote in theo.c from August 2010: "basically, dung beetles
fucking.  that's what kerberosV + openssl is like".

Discussed with many.  Tests by henning@@ reyk@@ and others.

     The oottpp program initializes and updates your current series of one-time
     passwords (OTPs).

     Use this to set a new series of one-time passwords.  Only perform this on
     the console or over an encrypted link as you will have to supply your
     pass-phrase.  The other two parameters are _s_e_q_u_e_n_c_e_-_n_u_m_b_e_r and _s_e_e_d.

     Options are:

     --dd      To delete a one-time password.

     --ff      Choose a different _a_l_g_o_r_i_t_h_m from the default md5.  Pick any of:
             md4, md5, and sha.

     --hh      For getting a help message.

     --ll      List the current table of one-time passwords.

     --oo      To open (unlock) the otp-entry for a user.

     --rr      To renew a one-time password series.  This operation can be per-
             formed over an potentially eavesdropped link because you do not
             supply the pass-phrase.  First you need to supply the current
             one-time password and then the new one corresponding to the sup-
             plied _s_e_q_u_e_n_c_e_-_n_u_m_b_e_r and _s_e_e_d.

     --uu      To choose a different _u_s_e_r to set one-time passwords for.  This
             only works when running oottpp as root.

@2nd part of:
update kerberosV to Heimdal 1.5.2 using BSD Makefiles based
on the ones from FreeBSD

This is getting commited now so that we can patch it up
fast in the tree.
There are known regressions so please don't try to build
this on your own now, please wait for the next available
snapshot.

If however you would still want to build it, make sure
build and install everything in the tools directory first.

@Import of heimdal-0.3f

Lots of changes, highlights include:

 * change default keytab to ANY:FILE:/etc/krb5.keytab,krb4:/etc/srvtab,
   the new keytab type that tries both of these in order (SRVTAB is
   also an alias for krb4:)

 * improve error reporting and error handling (error messages should
   be more detailed and more useful)

 * the API is closer to what MIT krb5 is using

 * more compatible with windows 2000

 * removed some memory leaks

 * bug fixes
