@The complexity and quality of kerberosV and the fact that almost
nobody is using it doesn't justify to have it in base - disable and
remove it.  If the 2 two people who use it still want it, they can
make a port or recompile OpenBSD on their own.

There is a quote in theo.c from August 2010: "basically, dung beetles
fucking.  that's what kerberosV + openssl is like".

Discussed with many.  Tests by henning@@ reyk@@ and others.

.Sh NAME
.Nm otp
.Nd manages one-time passwords
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm otp
.Op Fl dhlor
.Op Fl f Ar algorithm
.Op Fl u Ar user
.Ar sequence-number
.Ar seed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
program initializes and updates your current series of one-time
passwords (OTPs).
.Pp
Use this to set a new series of one-time passwords.  Only perform this
on the console or over an encrypted link as you will have to supply
your pass-phrase.  The other two parameters are
.Ar sequence-number
and
.Ar seed .
.Pp
Options are:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl d
To delete a one-time password.
.It Fl f
Choose a different
.Ar algorithm
from the default md5.  Pick any of: md4, md5, and sha.
.It Fl h
For getting a help message.
.It Fl l
List the current table of one-time passwords.
.It Fl o
To open (unlock) the otp-entry for a user.
.It Fl r
To renew a one-time password series.  This operation can be performed
over an potentially eavesdropped link because you do not supply the
pass-phrase.  First you need to supply the current one-time password
and then the new one corresponding to the supplied
.Ar sequence-number
and
.Ar seed .
.It Fl u
To choose a different
.Ar user
to set one-time passwords for.  This only works when running
.Nm
as root.

@2nd part of:
update kerberosV to Heimdal 1.5.2 using BSD Makefiles based
on the ones from FreeBSD

This is getting commited now so that we can patch it up
fast in the tree.
There are known regressions so please don't try to build
this on your own now, please wait for the next available
snapshot.

If however you would still want to build it, make sure
build and install everything in the tools directory first.

@These files are not use by us, so they're removed to make the tree
a little bit leaner, and to get rid of some bad string functions.
