@The complexity and quality of kerberosV and the fact that almost
nobody is using it doesn't justify to have it in base - disable and
remove it.  If the 2 two people who use it still want it, they can
make a port or recompile OpenBSD on their own.

There is a quote in theo.c from August 2010: "basically, dung beetles
fucking.  that's what kerberosV + openssl is like".

Discussed with many.  Tests by henning@@ reyk@@ and others.

     The oottpppprriinntt program prints lists of OTPs.

     Use this to print out a series of one-time passwords.  You will have to
     supply the _s_e_q_u_e_n_c_e _n_u_m_b_e_r and the _s_e_e_d as arguments and then the program
     will prompt you for your pass-phrase.

     There are several different print formats.  The default is to print each
     password with six short english words.

     Options are:

     --ee      Print the passwords in ``extended'' format.  In this format a
             prefix that says ``hex:'' or ``word:'' is included.

     --ff      To choose a different _a_l_g_o_r_i_t_h_m from the default md5.  Pick any
             of: md4, md5, and sha.

     --hh      Print the passwords in hex.

     --nn      Print _c_o_u_n_t one-time passwords, starting at _s_e_q_u_e_n_c_e_-_n_u_m_b_e_r and
             going backwards. The default is 10.

@2nd part of:
update kerberosV to Heimdal 1.5.2 using BSD Makefiles based
on the ones from FreeBSD

This is getting commited now so that we can patch it up
fast in the tree.
There are known regressions so please don't try to build
this on your own now, please wait for the next available
snapshot.

If however you would still want to build it, make sure
build and install everything in the tools directory first.

@Import of heimdal-0.3f

Lots of changes, highlights include:

 * change default keytab to ANY:FILE:/etc/krb5.keytab,krb4:/etc/srvtab,
   the new keytab type that tries both of these in order (SRVTAB is
   also an alias for krb4:)

 * improve error reporting and error handling (error messages should
   be more detailed and more useful)

 * the API is closer to what MIT krb5 is using

 * more compatible with windows 2000

 * removed some memory leaks

 * bug fixes
