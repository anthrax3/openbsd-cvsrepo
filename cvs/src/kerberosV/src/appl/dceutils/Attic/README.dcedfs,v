@The complexity and quality of kerberosV and the fact that almost
nobody is using it doesn't justify to have it in base - disable and
remove it.  If the 2 two people who use it still want it, they can
make a port or recompile OpenBSD on their own.

There is a quote in theo.c from August 2010: "basically, dung beetles
fucking.  that's what kerberosV + openssl is like".

Discussed with many.  Tests by henning@@ reyk@@ and others.

@This is a set of patches and files to get a DFS ticket from a k5 ticket.
This code comes from Doug Engert, Argonne Nat. Lab (See dce/README.original
for more info)

The files in dce are;
testpag: for testing if this is at all possible.
k5dfspag: included in libkrb5
k5dcecon: Creates (or searches for) the actual DFSPAG ticketfile.
dpagaix: An AIX syscall stub.
README.original: Original README file from Doug Engert


Certain applications (rshd/telnetd) have been patched to call the
functions in k5dfspag when the situation is right. They are ifdef
with DCE. The patches are also originally from Doug but they
where against MIT krb5 code and have been merged into heimdal by me.
I will try to fix ftpd soon...

There is also an ifdefs for DCE && AIX that can be used to make AIX
use DCE for getting group/passwd entries. This is needed if one is running
with a bare bones passwd/group file and AUTHSTATE set to DCE (This will be
more or less clear to people doing this...) I have forced this on for now.

k5dfspag.c is in lib/krb5
k5dfspag.c is dependent on DCE only.
It is also POSIX systems only. There are defines for the location of
k5dcecon and dpagaix that needs a correct configure setting.

k5dcecon needs no special things for the compile except whatever is needed
on the target system to compile dce programs.
(On aix the dce compile flags are: -D_THREAD_SAFE -D_AIX32_THREADS=1 -D_AIX41 -D_AES_SOURCE or one can use xlc_r4 if it is version 3.6.4 or later)

k5dcecon wants the following libs (on aix 4.3):
-ldce (and setenv from somewhere)

dpagaix is only needed on AIX (see k5dfspag.c).
dpagaix needs dfspag.exp and is linked with
ld -edpagaix -o dpagaix dpagaix.o dfspag.exp


Hope to get this into heimdal soon :-) although I know that you will have to
change some things to get it cleanly into configure. Since I don't know the
structure of the code (heimdal), nor enough of configure, good enough I
just won't try it myself.

One more thing, to get this to work one has to put fcache_version = x in
krb5.conf where x = whatever the DCE implementation understands, (usually
1 or 2).
Thanks for adding that...

PS
I have now added patches for configure.in and some Makefile.am's to get this
all cleanly (I hope) into heimdal.

@2nd part of:
update kerberosV to Heimdal 1.5.2 using BSD Makefiles based
on the ones from FreeBSD

This is getting commited now so that we can patch it up
fast in the tree.
There are known regressions so please don't try to build
this on your own now, please wait for the next available
snapshot.

If however you would still want to build it, make sure
build and install everything in the tools directory first.

@These files are not use by us, so they're removed to make the tree
a little bit leaner, and to get rid of some bad string functions.
