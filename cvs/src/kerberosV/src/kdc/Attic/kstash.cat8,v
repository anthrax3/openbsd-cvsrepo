@The complexity and quality of kerberosV and the fact that almost
nobody is using it doesn't justify to have it in base - disable and
remove it.  If the 2 two people who use it still want it, they can
make a port or recompile OpenBSD on their own.

There is a quote in theo.c from August 2010: "basically, dung beetles
fucking.  that's what kerberosV + openssl is like".

Discussed with many.  Tests by henning@@ reyk@@ and others.

     kkssttaasshh reads the Kerberos master key and stores it in a file that will be
     used by the KDC.

     Supported options:

     --ee _s_t_r_i_n_g, ----eennccttyyppee==_s_t_r_i_n_g

             the name of the master key file.

     ----ccoonnvveerrtt--ffiillee
             don't ask for a new master key, just read an old master key file,
             and write it back in the new keyfile format.

     ----rraannddoomm--kkeeyy
             generate a random master key.

     ----mmaasstteerr--kkeeyy--ffdd==_f_d
             filedescriptor to read passphrase from, if not specified the
             passphrase will be read from the terminal.

     _/_v_a_r_/_h_e_i_m_d_a_l_/_m_-_k_e_y is the default keyfile if no other keyfile is speci-
     fied.  The format of a Heimdal master key is the same as a keytab, so
     kkttuuttiill list can be used to list the content of the file.

@update kerberosV to Heimdal 1.5.2 using BSD Makefiles based
on the ones from FreeBSD

This is getting commited now so that we can patch it up
fast in the tree.
There are known regressions so please don't try to build
this on your own now, please wait for the next available
snapshot.

If however you would still want to build it, make sure
build and install everything in the tools directory first.

This is not the full commit yet because there are several
subdirectories.

@Import of heimdal-0.3f

Lots of changes, highlights include:

 * change default keytab to ANY:FILE:/etc/krb5.keytab,krb4:/etc/srvtab,
   the new keytab type that tries both of these in order (SRVTAB is
   also an alias for krb4:)

 * improve error reporting and error handling (error messages should
   be more detailed and more useful)

 * the API is closer to what MIT krb5 is using

 * more compatible with windows 2000

 * removed some memory leaks

 * bug fixes
