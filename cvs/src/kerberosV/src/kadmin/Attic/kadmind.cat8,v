@The complexity and quality of kerberosV and the fact that almost
nobody is using it doesn't justify to have it in base - disable and
remove it.  If the 2 two people who use it still want it, they can
make a port or recompile OpenBSD on their own.

There is a quote in theo.c from August 2010: "basically, dung beetles
fucking.  that's what kerberosV + openssl is like".

Discussed with many.  Tests by henning@@ reyk@@ and others.

     kkaaddmmiinndd listens for requests for changes to the Kerberos database and
     performs these, subject to permissions.  When starting, if stdin is a
     socket it assumes that it has been started by inetd(8), otherwise it
     behaves as a daemon, forking processes for each new connection. The
     ----ddeebbuugg option causes kkaaddmmiinndd to accept exactly one connection, which is
     useful for debugging.

     The kpasswdd(8) daemon is responsible for the Kerberos 5 password chang-
     ing protocol (used by kpasswd(1)).

     This daemon should only be run on the master server, and not on any
     slaves.

     Principals are always allowed to change their own password and list their
     own principal.  Apart from that, doing any operation requires permission
     explicitly added in the ACL file _/_v_a_r_/_h_e_i_m_d_a_l_/_k_a_d_m_i_n_d_._a_c_l.  The format of
     this file is:

     _p_r_i_n_c_i_p_a_l _r_i_g_h_t_s [_p_r_i_n_c_i_p_a_l_-_p_a_t_t_e_r_n]

     Where rights is any (comma separated) combination of:
     ++oo   change-password or cpw
     ++oo   list
     ++oo   delete
     ++oo   modify
     ++oo   add
     ++oo   get
     ++oo   all

     And the optional _p_r_i_n_c_i_p_a_l_-_p_a_t_t_e_r_n restricts the rights to operations on
     principals that match the glob-style pattern.

     Supported options:

     --cc _f_i_l_e, ----ccoonnffiigg--ffiillee==_f_i_l_e

             ports to listen to. By default, if run as a daemon, it listens to
             port 749, but you can add any number of ports with this option.
             The port string is a whitespace separated list of port specifica-
             tions, with the special string ``+'' representing the default
             port.

@update kerberosV to Heimdal 1.5.2 using BSD Makefiles based
on the ones from FreeBSD

This is getting commited now so that we can patch it up
fast in the tree.
There are known regressions so please don't try to build
this on your own now, please wait for the next available
snapshot.

If however you would still want to build it, make sure
build and install everything in the tools directory first.

This is not the full commit yet because there are several
subdirectories.

@Import of heimdal-0.3f

Lots of changes, highlights include:

 * change default keytab to ANY:FILE:/etc/krb5.keytab,krb4:/etc/srvtab,
   the new keytab type that tries both of these in order (SRVTAB is
   also an alias for krb4:)

 * improve error reporting and error handling (error messages should
   be more detailed and more useful)

 * the API is closer to what MIT krb5 is using

 * more compatible with windows 2000

 * removed some memory leaks

 * bug fixes
