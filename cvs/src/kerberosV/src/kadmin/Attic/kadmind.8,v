@The complexity and quality of kerberosV and the fact that almost
nobody is using it doesn't justify to have it in base - disable and
remove it.  If the 2 two people who use it still want it, they can
make a port or recompile OpenBSD on their own.

There is a quote in theo.c from August 2010: "basically, dung beetles
fucking.  that's what kerberosV + openssl is like".

Discussed with many.  Tests by henning@@ reyk@@ and others.

.Xc
.Oc
.Ek
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
listens for requests for changes to the Kerberos database and performs
these, subject to permissions.  When starting, if stdin is a socket it
assumes that it has been started by
.Xr inetd 8 ,
otherwise it behaves as a daemon, forking processes for each new
connection. The
.Fl Fl debug
option causes
.Nm
to accept exactly one connection, which is useful for debugging.
.Pp
The
.Xr kpasswdd 8
daemon is responsible for the Kerberos 5 password changing protocol
(used by
.Xr kpasswd 1 ) .
.Pp
This daemon should only be run on the master server, and not on any
slaves.
.Pp
Principals are always allowed to change their own password and list
their own principal.  Apart from that, doing any operation requires
permission explicitly added in the ACL file
.Pa /var/heimdal/kadmind.acl .
The format of this file is:
.Bd -ragged
.Va principal
.Va rights
.Op Va principal-pattern
.Ed
.Pp
Where rights is any (comma separated) combination of:
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
change-password or cpw
.It
list
.It
delete
.It
modify
.It
add
.It
get
.It
all
.El
.Pp
And the optional
.Ar principal-pattern
restricts the rights to operations on principals that match the
glob-style pattern.
.Pp
Supported options:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl c Ar file , Fl Fl config-file= Ns Ar file
location of config file
.It Fl k Ar file , Fl Fl key-file= Ns Ar file
location of master key file
.It Fl Fl keytab= Ns Ar keytab
what keytab to use
.It Fl r Ar realm , Fl Fl realm= Ns Ar realm
realm to use
.It Fl d , Fl Fl debug
enable debugging
.It Fl p Ar port , Fl Fl ports= Ns Ar port
ports to listen to. By default, if run as a daemon, it listens to port
749, but you can add any number of ports with this option. The port
string is a whitespace separated list of port specifications, with the
special string
.Dq +
representing the default port.
.El
.\".Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Sh FILES
.Pa /var/heimdal/kadmind.acl
.Sh EXAMPLES
This will cause
.Nm
to listen to port 4711 in addition to any
compiled in defaults:
.Pp
.D1 Nm Fl Fl ports Ns Li "=\*[q]+ 4711\*[q] &"
.Pp
This acl file will grant Joe all rights, and allow Mallory to view and
add host principals.
.Bd -literal -offset indent

@update kerberosV to Heimdal 1.5.2 using BSD Makefiles based
on the ones from FreeBSD

This is getting commited now so that we can patch it up
fast in the tree.
There are known regressions so please don't try to build
this on your own now, please wait for the next available
snapshot.

If however you would still want to build it, make sure
build and install everything in the tools directory first.

This is not the full commit yet because there are several
subdirectories.

Lots of changes, highlights include:

 * change default keytab to ANY:FILE:/etc/krb5.keytab,krb4:/etc/srvtab,
   the new keytab type that tries both of these in order (SRVTAB is
   also an alias for krb4:)

 * improve error reporting and error handling (error messages should
   be more detailed and more useful)

 * the API is closer to what MIT krb5 is using

 * more compatible with windows 2000

 * removed some memory leaks

 * bug fixes
