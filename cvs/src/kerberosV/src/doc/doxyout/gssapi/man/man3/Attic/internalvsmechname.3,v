@The complexity and quality of kerberosV and the fact that almost
nobody is using it doesn't justify to have it in base - disable and
remove it.  If the 2 two people who use it still want it, they can
make a port or recompile OpenBSD on their own.

There is a quote in theo.c from August 2010: "basically, dung beetles
fucking.  that's what kerberosV + openssl is like".

Discussed with many.  Tests by henning@@ reyk@@ and others.

.SH NAME
internalvsmechname \- Internal names and mechanism names 
.SH "Name forms"
.PP
There are two forms of name in GSS-API, Internal form and Contiguous string ('flat') form. gss_export_name() and \fBgss_import_name()\fP can be used to convert between the two forms.
.PP
.IP "\(bu" 2
The contiguous string form is described by an oid specificing the type and an octet string. A special form of the contiguous string form is the exported name object. The exported name defined for each mechanism, is something that can be stored and complared later. The exported name is what should be used for ACLs comparisons.

The Internal form
.PP
.PP
There is also special form of the Internal Name (IN), and that is the Mechanism Name (MN). In the mechanism name all the generic information is stripped of and only contain the information for one mechanism. In GSS-API some function return MN and some require MN as input. Each of these function is marked up as such.
.PP
Describe relationship between import_name, canonicalize_name, export_name and friends.

@2nd part of:
update kerberosV to Heimdal 1.5.2 using BSD Makefiles based
on the ones from FreeBSD

This is getting commited now so that we can patch it up
fast in the tree.
There are known regressions so please don't try to build
this on your own now, please wait for the next available
snapshot.

If however you would still want to build it, make sure
build and install everything in the tools directory first.
