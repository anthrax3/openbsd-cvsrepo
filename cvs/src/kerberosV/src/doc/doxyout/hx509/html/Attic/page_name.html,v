@The complexity and quality of kerberosV and the fact that almost
nobody is using it doesn't justify to have it in base - disable and
remove it.  If the 2 two people who use it still want it, they can
make a port or recompile OpenBSD on their own.

There is a quote in theo.c from August 2010: "basically, dung beetles
fucking.  that's what kerberosV + openssl is like".

Discussed with many.  Tests by henning@@ reyk@@ and others.

<h1><a class="anchor" name="page_name">PKIX/X.509 Names </a></h1>There are several names in PKIX/X.509, GeneralName and Name.<p>
A Name consists of an ordered list of Relative Distinguished Names (RDN). Each RDN consists of an unordered list of typed strings. The types are defined by OID and have long and short description. For example id-at-commonName (2.5.4.3) have the long name CommonName and short name CN. The string itself can be of several encoding, UTF8, UTF16, Teltex string, etc. The type limit what encoding should be used.<p>
GeneralName is a broader nametype that can contains al kind of stuff like Name, IP addresses, partial Name, etc.<p>
Name is mapped into a hx509_name object.<p>
Parse and string name into a hx509_name object with <a class="el" href="group__hx509__name.html#g0565f607a4e57d0911ee7081ad9548c5">hx509_parse_name()</a>, make it back into string representation with <a class="el" href="group__hx509__name.html#g1bd74b34e0aa88b083678ba231d38718">hx509_name_to_string()</a>.<p>

1.1
log
@2nd part of:
update kerberosV to Heimdal 1.5.2 using BSD Makefiles based
on the ones from FreeBSD

This is getting commited now so that we can patch it up
fast in the tree.
There are known regressions so please don't try to build
this on your own now, please wait for the next available
snapshot.

If however you would still want to build it, make sure
build and install everything in the tools directory first.
