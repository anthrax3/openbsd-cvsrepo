@The complexity and quality of kerberosV and the fact that almost
nobody is using it doesn't justify to have it in base - disable and
remove it.  If the 2 two people who use it still want it, they can
make a port or recompile OpenBSD on their own.

There is a quote in theo.c from August 2010: "basically, dung beetles
fucking.  that's what kerberosV + openssl is like".

Discussed with many.  Tests by henning@@ reyk@@ and others.

@@section Migration from MIT Kerberos to Heimdal

hpropd can read MIT Kerberos dump, the format is the same as used in
mit-kerberos 1.0b7, and to dump that format use the following command:
@@samp{kdb5_util dump -b7}.

To load the MIT Kerberos dump file, use the following command:

@@item Convert the database, check all principals that hprop complains
about.

@@samp{hprop -n --source=<NNN>| hpropd -n}

Replace <NNN> with whatever source you have, like krb4-db or krb4-dump.

@@item Run a Kerberos 5 slave for a while.

@@c XXX Add you slave first to your kdc list in you kdc.

@@item Figure out if it does everything you want it to.

@@item Let a small number of controlled users use Kerberos 5 tools.

Find a sample population of your users and check what programs they use,
you can also check the kdc-log to check what ticket are checked out.

@@item Burn the bridge and change the master.
@@item Let all users use the Kerberos 5 tools by default.
@@item Turn off services that do not need Kerberos 4 authentication.

Things that might be hard to get away is old programs with support for
Kerberos 4. Example applications are old Eudora installations using
KPOP, and Zephyr. Eudora can use the Kerberos 4 kerberos in the Heimdal
kdc.

@update kerberosV to Heimdal 1.5.2 using BSD Makefiles based
on the ones from FreeBSD

This is getting commited now so that we can patch it up
fast in the tree.
There are known regressions so please don't try to build
this on your own now, please wait for the next available
snapshot.

If however you would still want to build it, make sure
build and install everything in the tools directory first.

This is not the full commit yet because there are several
subdirectories.

1.1.1.2
log
@Import of heimdal-0.3f

Lots of changes, highlights include:

 * change default keytab to ANY:FILE:/etc/krb5.keytab,krb4:/etc/srvtab,
   the new keytab type that tries both of these in order (SRVTAB is
   also an alias for krb4:)

 * improve error reporting and error handling (error messages should
   be more detailed and more useful)

 * the API is closer to what MIT krb5 is using

 * more compatible with windows 2000

 * removed some memory leaks

 * bug fixes
