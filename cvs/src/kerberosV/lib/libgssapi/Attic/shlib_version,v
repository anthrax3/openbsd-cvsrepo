@The complexity and quality of kerberosV and the fact that almost
nobody is using it doesn't justify to have it in base - disable and
remove it.  If the 2 two people who use it still want it, they can
make a port or recompile OpenBSD on their own.

There is a quote in theo.c from August 2010: "basically, dung beetles
fucking.  that's what kerberosV + openssl is like".

Discussed with many.  Tests by henning@@ reyk@@ and others.

@Switch time_t, ino_t, clock_t, and struct kevent's ident and data
members to 64bit types.  Assign new syscall numbers for (almost
all) the syscalls that involve the affected types, including anything
with time_t, timeval, itimerval, timespec, rusage, dirent, stat,
or kevent arguments.  Add a d_off member to struct dirent and replace
getdirentries() with getdents(), thus immensely simplifying and
accelerating telldir/seekdir.  Build perl with -DBIG_TIME.

Bump the major on every single base library: the compat bits included
here are only good enough to make the transition; the T32 compat
option will be burned as soon as we've reached the new world are
are happy with the snapshots for all architectures.

DANGER: ABI incompatibility.  Updating to this kernel requires extra
work or you won't be able to login: install a snapshot instead.

Much assistance in fixing userland issues from deraadt@@ and tedu@@
and build assistance from todd@@ and otto@@

@2nd part of:
update kerberosV to Heimdal 1.5.2 using BSD Makefiles based
on the ones from FreeBSD

This is getting commited now so that we can patch it up
fast in the tree.
There are known regressions so please don't try to build
this on your own now, please wait for the next available
snapshot.

If however you would still want to build it, make sure
build and install everything in the tools directory first.
