.Dt AFSLOG 1
.Os HEIMDAL
.Sh NAME
.Nm afslog
.Nd "obtains AFS tokens"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl uvh
.Op Fl -cells Ns = Ns Ar cell
.Op Fl c Ar cell
.Op Fl k Ar realm
.Op Fl -realm Ns = Ns Ar realm
.Op Fl p Pa path
.Op Fl -paths Ns = Ns Ar path
.Op Fl -unlog
.Op Ar args
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command obtains AFS tokens for the cell or path
.Ar args Ns .
.Ar args
is treated as a path
if it contains the characters
.Li . Ns , Li .. Ns ,
or
.Li / Ns .
If not, it is treated as a cellname or the beginning of a cellname.
.Pp
The
.Fl c Ns , Fl -cells Ns , Fl p
and
.Fl -path
flags can be used to resolve ambiguities between cells and paths.
.Pp
If
.Nm
fails to guess the Kerberos realm to get tickets for,
.Fl k Ar realm
can be specified.
.Pp
If the
.Fl u
or
.Fl -unlog
flag is given any tokens are removed and all other arguments are ignored.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr kauth 1 ,
.Xr kafs 3
.Sh CAVEATS
.Nm
might fail to guess the Kerberos realm to get tickets for (for
instance if the volume location servers of the cell does not reside in
the kerberos realm that holds the AFS service key, and the correct
realm isn't the same as the cell name or the local realm
(this is not a common problem)).
The flag
.Fl k
can be used to give a hint. It should not be used unless there is a
problem, since all tickets will be taken from the specified realm and
this is not (usually) preferred.

@Heimdal lacks an afslog manpage. I created one based on the krb4 one.
