- if_addr RB_TREE (Address sort differently on an interface)
- skip steps changes
	- RDOMAIN
	- reordering of address/port tests
- fastroute is gone
- keep state is no longer printed by default
- lo0 now has link-local scope address in addition to ::1

@#test :broadcast and :network modifiers
pass in on lo0 from lo0:network to any keep state
pass out on lo0 inet from lo0:network to any
pass in on lo0 inet6 from lo0:network to any keep state

#broadcast on lo0 doesn't make sense at all!
#block in on lo0 from any to lo0:broadcast
