@Update regress tests for the following changes:
- if_addr RB_TREE (Address sort differently on an interface)
- skip steps changes
	- RDOMAIN
	- reordering of address/port tests
- fastroute is gone
- keep state is no longer printed by default
- lo0 now has link-local scope address in addition to ::1
