@Add dynamic (in-kernel) interface name -> address translation. Instead of
using just the interface name instead of an address and reloading the rule
set whenever the interface changes its address, the interface name can be
put in parentheses, and the kernel will keep track of changes and update
rules. There is no additional cost for evaluating rules (per packet),
the cost occurs when an interface changes address (and the rules are
traversed and updated where necessary).
