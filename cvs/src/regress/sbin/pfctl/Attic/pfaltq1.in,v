@lo1, tun0, tun1 don't exist any more. thus, create the interfaces we need for
regress purposes before starting and destroy them afterwards.
lo1 -> lo1000000
tun0 -> tun1000000

@new class of regress tests.
add target "pfaltq".
altq rules are loaded into the kernel and pfctl -gsq output is verified.
opposed to most other regress tests, these ones modify the existing setup,
as altq definitons cannot live in anchors. all queue definitions are flushed
by these tests. Thus, they are not run by default (not part of
REGRESS_TARGETS), but must be run explicitely (make pfaltq).
