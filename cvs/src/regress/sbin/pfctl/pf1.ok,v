@Update regress tests for the following changes:
- if_addr RB_TREE (Address sort differently on an interface)
- skip steps changes
	- RDOMAIN
	- reordering of address/port tests
- fastroute is gone
- keep state is no longer printed by default
- lo0 now has link-local scope address in addition to ::1

@Add dynamic (in-kernel) interface name -> address translation. Instead of
using just the interface name instead of an address and reloading the rule
set whenever the interface changes its address, the interface name can be
put in parentheses, and the kernel will keep track of changes and update
rules. There is no additional cost for evaluating rules (per packet),
the cost occurs when an interface changes address (and the rules are
traversed and updated where necessary).
