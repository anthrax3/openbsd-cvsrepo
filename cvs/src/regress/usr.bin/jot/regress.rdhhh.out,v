@If you see code like this, you know something's quite wrong
(present in some form since r1.1, still present in r1.31):

229                 case 013:
230                         if (randomize)
231                                 begin = BEGIN_DEF;
232                         else if (reps == 0)
233                                 errx(1, "Must specify begin if reps == 0");
234                         begin = ender - reps * s + s;

Add two tests that check for the intended behavior.
