1.1
log
@Test suite for colrm(1) including tests for single byte characters,
tabs, backspaces, multibyte characters of width 1, 0, and 2,
invalid bytes and non-printable characters.  All tests are run
both with the UTF-8 and the C locale.

About half the tests are currently broken, and not only the multibyte
tests, but also half of the tab and backspace tests.  The program is
expected to be fixed soon, and the suite will be hooked up after that.
