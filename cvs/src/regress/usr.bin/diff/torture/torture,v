# Run this script on a freshly checked out cvs dir. Local modifications

# Make sure you have $CVSROOT setup properly, preferably on a local

log
@A shell script to run a very large scale diff/patch/cmp regression.
The script recursively walks though a checked out cvs dir and
retrieves all revisions from each file. All pairs of these revisions
are diffed against each other, and the resulting patches are checked
using patch(1) and cmp(1). Based on an idea from deraadt@@.
