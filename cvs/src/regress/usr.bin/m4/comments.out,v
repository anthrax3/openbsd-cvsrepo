1.1
log
@finally make our m4 SusV3-compliant.

- changecom and changequote have a simple definition (that matches gnu-m4,
coincidentally, so we no longer need two distinct modes for these)

- off-by-one bug in -s, this finally works.

- reorder main parser loop, so that we can use alphabetic constructs in
quotes/comments.

- rename putback to pushback, this matches comments, and makes more sense.

- more uniform (and updated) description of changequote/changecom.

- new, systematic regression tests of comments/quotes.

- framework to test -s: one perl script to reconstitute `full' files with
all line numbers, so that we can verify the output without needing a
complete match.

okay otto@@, fries@@
