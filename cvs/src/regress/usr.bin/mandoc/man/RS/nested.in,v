1.2
log
@Fix a quirk with respect to empty .HP.
Found while writing a regression test for man_macro.c rev. 1.66.

1.1
log
@Correct indentation for lists and displays inside lists.

Inspired by a diff from millert@@, but implemented rather

In particular, this one respects -offset and -width
arguments found in the input file.
