log
@Messages of the -Wbase level now print STYLE:.  Since this
causes horrible churn anyway, profit of the opportunity to stop
excessive testing, such that this is hopefully the last instance
of such churn.  Consistently use OpenBSD RCS tags, blank .Os,
blank fourth .TH argument, and Mdocdate like everywhere else.
Use -Ios=OpenBSD for platform-independent predictable output.

log
@For .RS, we need to save the information how much we actually indented
because negative indents can get truncated, in which case we no longer
know how to restore the original indent at the end of the block.
This also solves another case of effectively infinite output found
by jsg@@ with afl, triggered by very large negative indents.
