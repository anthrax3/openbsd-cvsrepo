       tag   body

       Here we need some text that is long enough to span more than one output
             line, such that we can see the hanging indentation.
       out of body

1.1
log
@In the parser, when closing an explicit block that is not open,
close below-subsection implicit scopes that may still be open.
In the formatter, make sure indentation is reset when leaving a scope,
not only when entering the next one.

Improves the formatting of gpg(1); issue reported by jca on ports.
