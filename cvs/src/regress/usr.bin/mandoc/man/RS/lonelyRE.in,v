log
@Messages of the -Wbase level now print STYLE:.  Since this
causes horrible churn anyway, profit of the opportunity to stop
excessive testing, such that this is hopefully the last instance
of such churn.  Consistently use OpenBSD RCS tags, blank .Os,
blank fourth .TH argument, and Mdocdate like everywhere else.
Use -Ios=OpenBSD for platform-independent predictable output.

Here we need some text that is long enough to span more than one
output line, such that we can see the hanging indentation.

log
@In the parser, when closing an explicit block that is not open,
close below-subsection implicit scopes that may still be open.
In the formatter, make sure indentation is reset when leaving a scope,
not only when entering the next one.

Improves the formatting of gpg(1); issue reported by jca on ports.
