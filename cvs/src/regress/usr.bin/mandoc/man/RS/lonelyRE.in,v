log
@In the parser, when closing an explicit block that is not open,
close below-subsection implicit scopes that may still be open.
In the formatter, make sure indentation is reset when leaving a scope,
not only when entering the next one.

Improves the formatting of gpg(1); issue reported by jca on ports.

output line, such that we can see the hanging indentation.
