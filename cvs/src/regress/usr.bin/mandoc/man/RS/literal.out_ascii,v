              This is a short line.
              This is a very long line that would wrap if it weren't in literal context.

log
@In literal mode (.nf), each input line must be kept together
on the same output line, even if it is longer than the output width.
This commit fixes a bug allowing an overly long last line of an
indented block (.RS) to be broken even in literal mode.

The bug was found using the sudo_plugin(4) manual provided by millert@@.

I introduced the bug in rev. 1.84 during the g2k12 Budapest hackathon.
