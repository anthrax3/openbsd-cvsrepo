           hanged This is very long text.  Let's see where it will break the
                       line, and which indent the next line will have -
                       hopefully 12n.

@Fix a quirk with respect to empty .HP.
Found while writing a regression test for man_macro.c rev. 1.66.
Incidentally, this brings rendering of XFreeEventData(3) closer to groff.

1.1
log
@Correct indentation for lists and displays inside lists.

Inspired by a diff from millert@@, but implemented rather
differently and with slightly better functionality.
In particular, this one respects -offset and -width
arguments found in the input file.
