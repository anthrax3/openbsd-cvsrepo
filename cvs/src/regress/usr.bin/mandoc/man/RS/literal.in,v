@Messages of the -Wbase level now print STYLE:.  Since this
causes horrible churn anyway, profit of the opportunity to stop
excessive testing, such that this is hopefully the last instance
of such churn.  Consistently use OpenBSD RCS tags, blank .Os,
blank fourth .TH argument, and Mdocdate like everywhere else.
Use -Ios=OpenBSD for platform-independent predictable output.

log
@In literal mode (.nf), each input line must be kept together
on the same output line, even if it is longer than the output width.
This commit fixes a bug allowing an overly long last line of an
indented block (.RS) to be broken even in literal mode.

The bug was found using the sudo_plugin(4) manual provided by millert@@.

I introduced the bug in rev. 1.84 during the g2k12 Budapest hackathon.
