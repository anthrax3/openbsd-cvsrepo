       nf-indent - indentation of literal blocks

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       Here comes an indented block:
       oneword
       two words
       and three words
       This is a very long line; because it is indented, it is a bit too long to fit.
       blank line:

       line with only a zero-width space:

       line with only a normal space character:

       end of literal
       He is some more regular text.

@multiple fixes to -Tascii .HP rendering:
* do not add an excessive blank line before the block
* in literal mode, start a new line after the tag

getting this to work requires some general (print_man_node) fixes:
* in literal mode, break the output line at the end of each
input line, not just after those input lines ending in text
* but don't break it when there was no output on the line
* and adjust the margins after the .HP tag

these general fixes require an adjustment to -Tascii .TP rendering:
* set up NOBREAK mode before the body, not after the head

finally, based on all this, implement -Tman .Bl -hang in terms of .HP

@After unifying volume titles in the page headers for man(7) and mdoc(7),
adjust the expected man(7) output to the new convention.

log
@Complete overhaul of the mandoc(1) test suite.
* Test the recently introduced -Tman output mode, too.
* Specify date and OS arguments in all tests.
* Remove the kludge of sed(1)ing away the page footer lines.
* New make(1) variables SKIP_TMAN, SKIP_GROFF.
* Drop obsolete, clumsy make(1) variable GROFF_TARGETS.
* Delete obsolete mdoc/Bl/E*.sh error reporting tests.
* Silence char/N/basic.
* New targets:
- ascii, ascii-clean - to run -Tascii tests only
- tman, tman-clean - to run the new -Tman tests only
- obj-clean - maintainer only, needed before groff-clean and groff
- groff-clean - maintainer only, affects checked-in files

1.1
log
@Multiple man(7) .IP and .TP fixes started during p2k10:

Affecting both -Tascii and -Thtml:
* The .IP HEAD uses the second argument as the width, not the last one.
* Only print the first .IP HEAD argument, not all but the last.

Affecting only -Tascii:
* The .IP and .TP HEADs must be printed without literal mode,
  but literal mode must be restored afterwards.
* After the .IP and .TP bodies, we only want term_newln(), not
  term_flushln(), or we would get two blank lines in literal mode.
* The .TP HEAD does not use TWOSPACE, just like .IP doesn't either.
* In literal mode, clear NOLPAD after each line, or subsequent lines
  would get no indentation whatsoever.

Affecting only -Thtml:
* Only print next-line .TP children, instead of all but the first.

OK kristaps@@ on the -Tascii part; and:
"Can you work this into man_html.c, too?"
