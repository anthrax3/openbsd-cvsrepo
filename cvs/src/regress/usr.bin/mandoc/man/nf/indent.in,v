@Messages of the -Wbase level now print STYLE:.  Since this
causes horrible churn anyway, profit of the opportunity to stop
excessive testing, such that this is hopefully the last instance
of such churn.  Consistently use OpenBSD RCS tags, blank .Os,
blank fourth .TH argument, and Mdocdate like everywhere else.
Use -Ios=OpenBSD for platform-independent predictable output.

.TH NF-INDENT 1 "January 4, 2011"
.SH NAME
nf-indent \- indentation of literal blocks
.SH DESCRIPTION
Here comes
an indented block:
.nf
oneword
two words
and three words
This is a very long line; because it is indented, it is a bit too long to fit.
blank line:

line with only a zero-width space:
\&
line with only a normal space character:
 
end of literal
.fi
He is some more
regular text.

log
@multiple fixes to -Tascii .HP rendering:
* do not add an excessive blank line before the block
* in literal mode, start a new line after the tag

getting this to work requires some general (print_man_node) fixes:
* in literal mode, break the output line at the end of each
input line, not just after those input lines ending in text
* but don't break it when there was no output on the line
* and adjust the margins after the .HP tag

these general fixes require an adjustment to -Tascii .TP rendering:
* set up NOBREAK mode before the body, not after the head

finally, based on all this, implement -Tman .Bl -hang in terms of .HP

1.2
log
@Complete overhaul of the mandoc(1) test suite.
* Test the recently introduced -Tman output mode, too.
* Specify date and OS arguments in all tests.
* Remove the kludge of sed(1)ing away the page footer lines.
* New make(1) variables SKIP_TMAN, SKIP_GROFF.
* Drop obsolete, clumsy make(1) variable GROFF_TARGETS.
* Delete obsolete mdoc/Bl/E*.sh error reporting tests.
* Silence char/N/basic.
* New targets:
- ascii, ascii-clean - to run -Tascii tests only
- tman, tman-clean - to run the new -Tman tests only
- obj-clean - maintainer only, needed before groff-clean and groff
- groff-clean - maintainer only, affects checked-in files

1.1
log
@Multiple man(7) .IP and .TP fixes started during p2k10:

Affecting both -Tascii and -Thtml:
* The .IP HEAD uses the second argument as the width, not the last one.
* Only print the first .IP HEAD argument, not all but the last.

Affecting only -Tascii:
* The .IP and .TP HEADs must be printed without literal mode,
  but literal mode must be restored afterwards.
* After the .IP and .TP bodies, we only want term_newln(), not
  term_flushln(), or we would get two blank lines in literal mode.
* The .TP HEAD does not use TWOSPACE, just like .IP doesn't either.
* In literal mode, clear NOLPAD after each line, or subsequent lines
  would get no indentation whatsoever.

Affecting only -Thtml:
* Only print next-line .TP children, instead of all but the first.

OK kristaps@@ on the -Tascii part; and:
"Can you work this into man_html.c, too?"
