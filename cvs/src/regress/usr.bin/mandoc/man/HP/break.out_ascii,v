       HP-break - breaking the head line of hanged paragraphs

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       This is an extremely long head line of a hanged paragraph; it is so
                   long that it won't even fit on the line.
                   The body of the hanged paragraph is quite long as well and
                   will again break the line.
