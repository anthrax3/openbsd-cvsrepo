@more tests for excessively long text in TERMP_NOBREAK mode

1.1
log
@multiple fixes to -Tascii .HP rendering:
* do not add an excessive blank line before the block
* in literal mode, start a new line after the tag

getting this to work requires some general (print_man_node) fixes:
* in literal mode, break the output line at the end of each
input line, not just after those input lines ending in text
* but don't break it when there was no output on the line
* and adjust the margins after the .HP tag

these general fixes require an adjustment to -Tascii .TP rendering:
* set up NOBREAK mode before the body, not after the head

finally, based on all this, implement -Tman .Bl -hang in terms of .HP
