log
@Messages of the -Wbase level now print STYLE:.  Since this
causes horrible churn anyway, profit of the opportunity to stop
excessive testing, such that this is hopefully the last instance
of such churn.  Consistently use OpenBSD RCS tags, blank .Os,
blank fourth .TH argument, and Mdocdate like everywhere else.
Use -Ios=OpenBSD for platform-independent predictable output.

1.1
log
@multiple fixes to -Tascii .HP rendering:
* do not add an excessive blank line before the block
* in literal mode, start a new line after the tag

getting this to work requires some general (print_man_node) fixes:
* in literal mode, break the output line at the end of each
input line, not just after those input lines ending in text
* but don't break it when there was no output on the line
* and adjust the margins after the .HP tag

these general fixes require an adjustment to -Tascii .TP rendering:
* set up NOBREAK mode before the body, not after the head

finally, based on all this, implement -Tman .Bl -hang in terms of .HP
