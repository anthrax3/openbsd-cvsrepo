@If an explicit line break request (.br or .sp) occurs within an .HP block,
the next line doesn't hang, but is simply indented.
Issue found by Christian Neukirchen <chneukirchen at gmail dot com>
in the dmsetup(8) manual on Linux.
This patch also improves the indentation of XDGA(3) and XrmGetResource(3).

log
@We repeatedly observed assertion crashes in the low-level terminal
output handler because the high level terminal formatters could be
tricked into setting the left margin further to the right than the
right margin.  Today, jsg@@ found more of these with afl.

Change the internal interface between both levels, aiming for
simplicity and robustness of the code.  Treat both margins as
*independent* settings:  Now, termp.offset is the requested left
margin, and termp.rmargin is the available space.  Let the lower
level cope with that case of insufficient space.

Obviously, high level code that does centering or flush right
still has to do careful checks, so i did a full audit of margin
settings in the terminal formatters.

Fixes crashes caused by excessively long title or date strings in
the man(7) footer, operating system or date strings in the mdoc(7)
footer, volume strings in the man(7) or mdoc(7) header, and a few
cases related to some non-prologue macros.

Testing a hanged paragraph with a large indentation width,
in this case 78n, requires more text.

log
@multiple fixes to -Tascii .HP rendering:
* do not add an excessive blank line before the block
* in literal mode, start a new line after the tag

getting this to work requires some general (print_man_node) fixes:
* in literal mode, break the output line at the end of each
input line, not just after those input lines ending in text
* but don't break it when there was no output on the line
* and adjust the margins after the .HP tag

these general fixes require an adjustment to -Tascii .TP rendering:
* set up NOBREAK mode before the body, not after the head

finally, based on all this, implement -Tman .Bl -hang in terms of .HP
