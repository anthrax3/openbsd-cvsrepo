1.2
log
@Messages of the -Wbase level now print STYLE:.  Since this
causes horrible churn anyway, profit of the opportunity to stop
excessive testing, such that this is hopefully the last instance
of such churn.  Consistently use OpenBSD RCS tags, blank .Os,
blank fourth .TH argument, and Mdocdate like everywhere else.
Use -Ios=OpenBSD for platform-independent predictable output.

log
@Add a new term_flushln() flag TERMP_BRIND (if break, then indent)
to control indentation of continuation lines in TERMP_NOBREAK mode.
In the past, this was always on; continue using it
for .Bl, .Nm, .Fn, .Fo, and .HP, but no longer for .IP and .TP.

I looked at this because sthen@@ reported the issue in a manual
of a Perl module from ports, but it affects base, too: This patch
reduces groff-mandoc differences in base by more than 15%.
