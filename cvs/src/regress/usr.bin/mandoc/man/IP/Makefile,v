@Add a new term_flushln() flag TERMP_BRIND (if break, then indent)
to control indentation of continuation lines in TERMP_NOBREAK mode.
In the past, this was always on; continue using it
for .Bl, .Nm, .Fn, .Fo, and .HP, but no longer for .IP and .TP.

I looked at this because sthen@@ reported the issue in a manual
of a Perl module from ports, but it affects base, too: This patch
reduces groff-mandoc differences in base by more than 15%.

@Complete overhaul of the mandoc(1) test suite.
* Test the recently introduced -Tman output mode, too.
* Specify date and OS arguments in all tests.
* Remove the kludge of sed(1)ing away the page footer lines.
* New make(1) variables SKIP_TMAN, SKIP_GROFF.
* Drop obsolete, clumsy make(1) variable GROFF_TARGETS.
* Delete obsolete mdoc/Bl/E*.sh error reporting tests.
* Silence char/N/basic.
* New targets:
- ascii, ascii-clean - to run -Tascii tests only
- tman, tman-clean - to run the new -Tman tests only
- obj-clean - maintainer only, needed before groff-clean and groff
- groff-clean - maintainer only, affects checked-in files

@Fix stupid commit error pointed out by guenther@@ (thanks!):
1) Actually commit TP/* this time.
2) Revert IP/* to 1.1, which is the correct version.

What happened is that i committed both IP/* and TP/* into IP,
committing two versions in one commit,
because the file TP/CVS/Repository was corrupt in my tree.
I didn't even know that could happen...

@Multiple man(7) .IP and .TP fixes started during p2k10:

Affecting both -Tascii and -Thtml:
* The .IP HEAD uses the second argument as the width, not the last one.
* Only print the first .IP HEAD argument, not all but the last.

Affecting only -Tascii:
* The .IP and .TP HEADs must be printed without literal mode,
  but literal mode must be restored afterwards.
* After the .IP and .TP bodies, we only want term_newln(), not
  term_flushln(), or we would get two blank lines in literal mode.
* The .TP HEAD does not use TWOSPACE, just like .IP doesn't either.
* In literal mode, clear NOLPAD after each line, or subsequent lines
  would get no indentation whatsoever.

Affecting only -Thtml:
* Only print next-line .TP children, instead of all but the first.

OK kristaps@@ on the -Tascii part; and:
"Can you work this into man_html.c, too?"
