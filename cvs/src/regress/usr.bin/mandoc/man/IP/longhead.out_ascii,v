       IP-longhead - indented paragraph with a long head

       normal text

       This indented paragraph has ridiculously long text in its head, such
       that it doesn't even fit on the line
             paragraph body

       normal text

1.1
log
@Add a new term_flushln() flag TERMP_BRIND (if break, then indent)
to control indentation of continuation lines in TERMP_NOBREAK mode.
In the past, this was always on; continue using it
for .Bl, .Nm, .Fn, .Fo, and .HP, but no longer for .IP and .TP.

I looked at this because sthen@@ reported the issue in a manual
of a Perl module from ports, but it affects base, too: This patch
reduces groff-mandoc differences in base by more than 15%.
