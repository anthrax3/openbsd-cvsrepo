log
@Messages of the -Wbase level now print STYLE:.  Since this
causes horrible churn anyway, profit of the opportunity to stop
excessive testing, such that this is hopefully the last instance
of such churn.  Consistently use OpenBSD RCS tags, blank .Os,
blank fourth .TH argument, and Mdocdate like everywhere else.
Use -Ios=OpenBSD for platform-independent predictable output.

log
@Check that mandoc handles non-numeric width arguments
to .Bl -tag and .TP the same way as groff, even via -Tman.
Some time ago, millert@@ reported issues with these;
apparently, those issues were fixed since then.
