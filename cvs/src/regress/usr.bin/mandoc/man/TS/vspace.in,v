@Messages of the -Wbase level now print STYLE:.  Since this
causes horrible churn anyway, profit of the opportunity to stop
excessive testing, such that this is hopefully the last instance
of such churn.  Consistently use OpenBSD RCS tags, blank .Os,
blank fourth .TH argument, and Mdocdate like everywhere else.
Use -Ios=OpenBSD for platform-independent predictable output.

1.1
log
@Fix the vertical spacing around tbl(7) instances in man(7).

Groff forces the document author to manually request sufficient spacing
after .TE - that is, at least .sp 1v after a table with the "box" option
and at least .sp 2v after a table with the "doublebox" option - or else
it clobbers the box.  I consider that insane, so i'm not imitating groff
in that respect.  Instead, i add at least as much vertical space as groff,
or more where required to avoid clobbering the box.

Consequently, output will be identical for input that looks sane with
groff, and mandoc will make output look better for input that looks bad
with groff.

As a side effect, having identical output for portable input
makes it possible to set up the first regression tests for tbl(7).
