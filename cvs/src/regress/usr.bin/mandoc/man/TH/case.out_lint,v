log
@Now that we have the -Wstyle message level, downgrade six warnings
that are not syntax mistakes and that do not cause wrong formatting
or content to style suggestions.
Also upgrade two warnings that may cause information loss to errors.

1.6
log
@Messages of the -Wbase level now print STYLE:.  Since this
causes horrible churn anyway, profit of the opportunity to stop
excessive testing, such that this is hopefully the last instance
of such churn.  Consistently use OpenBSD RCS tags, blank .Os,
blank fourth .TH argument, and Mdocdate like everywhere else.
Use -Ios=OpenBSD for platform-independent predictable output.

@Clean up the warnings related to document structure.
* Hierarchical naming of the related enum mandocerr items.
* Mention the offending macro, section title, or string.
While here, improve some wordings:
* Descriptive instead of imperative style.
* Uniform style for "missing" and "skipping".
* Where applicable, mention the fallback used.
