1.3
log
@Messages of the -Wbase level now print STYLE:.  Since this
causes horrible churn anyway, profit of the opportunity to stop
excessive testing, such that this is hopefully the last instance
of such churn.  Consistently use OpenBSD RCS tags, blank .Os,
blank fourth .TH argument, and Mdocdate like everywhere else.
Use -Ios=OpenBSD for platform-independent predictable output.

log
@The "value" argument to the roff(7) .nr requests ends right before
the first non-digit character.  While here, implement and document
an optional sign, requesting increment or decrement, as documented
in the Ossanna/Kernighan/Ritter troff manual and supported by groff.

1.1
log
@Expand references to number registers in exactly the same way as
references to user-defined strings.  While here, make number registers
signed int, like in groff.

Inspired by NetBSD roff.c rev. 1.8 and read.c rev. 1.7
written by Christos Zoulas on March 21, 2013, but implemented
in a completely different way, without hacking into read.c,
where this functionality really doesn't belong.
