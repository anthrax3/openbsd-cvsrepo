log
@Messages of the -Wbase level now print STYLE:.  Since this
causes horrible churn anyway, profit of the opportunity to stop
excessive testing, such that this is hopefully the last instance
of such churn.  Consistently use OpenBSD RCS tags, blank .Os,
blank fourth .TH argument, and Mdocdate like everywhere else.
Use -Ios=OpenBSD for platform-independent predictable output.

log
@Major roff_getname() cleanup.
* Return the name even if it is terminated by an escape sequence, not a blank.
* Skip the full escape sequence using mandoc_escape(), not just the first byte.
* Make it non-destructive, return the length instead of writing a '\0'.
* Let .ds and .as cope with the above changes to the internal interface.
* Fix .rm and .rr to accept an escape sequence as the end of a name.
* Fix .nr and .rr to not set/delete a register with an empty name.
