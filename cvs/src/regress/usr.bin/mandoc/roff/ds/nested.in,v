@Messages of the -Wbase level now print STYLE:.  Since this
causes horrible churn anyway, profit of the opportunity to stop
excessive testing, such that this is hopefully the last instance
of such churn.  Consistently use OpenBSD RCS tags, blank .Os,
blank fourth .TH argument, and Mdocdate like everywhere else.
Use -Ios=OpenBSD for platform-independent predictable output.

@We already supported (outer) user-defined strings containing references
to other (inner) user-defined strings in their values, such that the inner
ones get expanded at expansion time of the outer ones (delayed evaluation).
Now we also support specifying the name of an (outer) user-defined
string to expand using the expanded values of some other (inner)
user-defined strings (indirect reference).
