1.1
log
@Implement the roff(7) .as request (append to user-defined string).
Missing feature found by jca@@ in ratpoison(1).
The ratpoison(1) manual still doesn't work because it uses .shift
and .while, too (apparently, ratpoison is so complex that it
needs a Turing-complete language to even format its manual :-).

Written at Christchurch International Airport.
