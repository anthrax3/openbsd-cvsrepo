@We already supported (outer) user-defined strings containing references
to other (inner) user-defined strings in their values, such that the inner
ones get expanded at expansion time of the outer ones (delayed evaluation).
Now we also support specifying the name of an (outer) user-defined
string to expand using the expanded values of some other (inner)
user-defined strings (indirect reference).
