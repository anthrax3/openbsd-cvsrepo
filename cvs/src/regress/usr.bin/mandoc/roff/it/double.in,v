1.1
log
@Rudimentary implementation of the .it request (input line trap).
As with any low-level roff request involving subtle interactions
with macro internals, this implementation is not exact, but it
does handle the simplest cases.

This request occurs in man(7) code generated from DocBook,
for example mysql(1) and yasm_arch(7).
Thanks to brad@@ for reporting the issue back in January 2011.
