log
@Messages of the -Wbase level now print STYLE:.  Since this
causes horrible churn anyway, profit of the opportunity to stop
excessive testing, such that this is hopefully the last instance
of such churn.  Consistently use OpenBSD RCS tags, blank .Os,
blank fourth .TH argument, and Mdocdate like everywhere else.
Use -Ios=OpenBSD for platform-independent predictable output.

@Implement appending to standard man(7) and mdoc(7) macros with .am.

With roff_getstrn(), provide finer control which definitions
can be used for what:
* All definitions can be used for .if d tests and .am appending.
* User-defined for \* expansion, .dei expansion, and macro calling.
* Predefined for \* expansion.
* Standard macros, original or renamed, for macro calling.

Several related improvements while here:
* Do not return string table entries that have explicitly been removed.
* Do not create a rentab entry when trying to rename a non-existent macro.
* Clear an existing rentab entry when the external interface
roff_setstr() is called with its name.
* Avoid trailing blanks in macro lines generated from renamed
and from aliased macros.
* Delete the duplicate __m*_reserved[] tables, just use roff_name[].
