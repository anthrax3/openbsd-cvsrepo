1.2
log
@Messages of the -Wbase level now print STYLE:.  Since this
causes horrible churn anyway, profit of the opportunity to stop
excessive testing, such that this is hopefully the last instance
of such churn.  Consistently use OpenBSD RCS tags, blank .Os,
blank fourth .TH argument, and Mdocdate like everywhere else.
Use -Ios=OpenBSD for platform-independent predictable output.

1.1
log
@Rudimentary implementation of the roff(7) \o escape sequence (overstrike).
This is of some relevance because the pod2man(1) preamble abuses it
for the icelandic letter Thorn, instead of simply using \(TP and \(Tp.
Missing feature found by sthen@@ in DateTime::Locale::is_IS(3p).
