log
@Messages of the -Wbase level now print STYLE:.  Since this
causes horrible churn anyway, profit of the opportunity to stop
excessive testing, such that this is hopefully the last instance
of such churn.  Consistently use OpenBSD RCS tags, blank .Os,
blank fourth .TH argument, and Mdocdate like everywhere else.
Use -Ios=OpenBSD for platform-independent predictable output.

log
@Fully implement the \B (validate numerical expression) and
partially implement the \w (measure text width) escape sequence
in a way that makes them usable in numerical expressions and in
conditional requests, similar to how \n (interpolate number register)
and \* (expand user-defined string) are implemented.

This lets mandoc(1) handle the baroque low-level roff code
found at the beginning of the ggrep(1) manual.
Thanks to pascal@@ for the report.
