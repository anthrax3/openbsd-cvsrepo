1.1
log
@While i already got my fingers dirty on mandoc_escape(),
profit of the occasion to pull out some spaghetti, that is,
three confusing variables and fourteen pointless assignments
among them; instead, always operate on the official pointers
**start, **end, and *sz, each of which conveys an obvious meaning.

No functional change intended, and the new tests confirm that
everything still (err...) "works", as far as that word can be
applied to the kind of roff(7) mock-up code i'm polishing here.
