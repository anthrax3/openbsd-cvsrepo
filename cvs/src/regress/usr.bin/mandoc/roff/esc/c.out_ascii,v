@Messages of the -Wbase level now print STYLE:.  Since this
causes horrible churn anyway, profit of the opportunity to stop
excessive testing, such that this is hopefully the last instance
of such churn.  Consistently use OpenBSD RCS tags, blank .Os,
blank fourth .TH argument, and Mdocdate like everywhere else.
Use -Ios=OpenBSD for platform-independent predictable output.

@Many people have been complaining for a long time that ``...'' looks
ugly in -Tascii output.  For that reason, bentley@@ submitted patches
to render "..." instead to groff in November 2014 (yes, more than
two years ago).  Carsten Kunze yesterday merged them for the upcoming
groff-1.22.4 release.  Yay!

Consequently, do the same in mandoc: Render \(Lq and \(Rq (which
are used for .Do, .Dq, .Lb, and .St) as '"' in -Tascii output.
All other output modes including -Tutf8 remain unchanged.

@Fix the implementation and documentation of \c (continue text input line).
In particular, make it work in no-fill mode, too.

log
@While i already got my fingers dirty on mandoc_escape(),
profit of the occasion to pull out some spaghetti, that is,
three confusing variables and fourteen pointless assignments
among them; instead, always operate on the official pointers
**start, **end, and *sz, each of which conveys an obvious meaning.

No functional change intended, and the new tests confirm that
everything still (err...) "works", as far as that word can be
applied to the kind of roff(7) mock-up code i'm polishing here.
