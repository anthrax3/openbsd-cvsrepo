@Minimal implementation of the \h (horizontal motion) escape sequence.
Good enough to cope with the average DocBook insanity.

1.1
log
@Make recursive parsing of roff(7) escapes actually work in the general case,
in particular when the inner escapes are preceded or followed by other terms.
While doing so, remove lots of bogus code that was trying to make pointless
distinctions between numeric and non-numeric escape sequences, while both
actually share the same syntax and we ignore the semantics anyway.

This prevents some of the strings defined in the pod2man(1) preamble
from producing garbage output, in particular in scandinavian words.
Of course, proper rendering of scandinavian national characters
cannot be expected even with these fixes.
