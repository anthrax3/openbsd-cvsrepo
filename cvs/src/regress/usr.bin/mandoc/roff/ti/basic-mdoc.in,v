log
@Messages of the -Wbase level now print STYLE:.  Since this
causes horrible churn anyway, profit of the opportunity to stop
excessive testing, such that this is hopefully the last instance
of such churn.  Consistently use OpenBSD RCS tags, blank .Os,
blank fourth .TH argument, and Mdocdate like everywhere else.
Use -Ios=OpenBSD for platform-independent predictable output.

.Nd temporary indent in mdoc(7)
.Sh DESCRIPTION
initial text
.ti 10n
This text is indented.
However, the indent is temporary,
so as soon as the line wraps, it is gone.
.ti +10n
The temporary indent can be relative.
All the same, it will expire in the usual way.
.ti -3n
It is also possible to temporarily reduce the indentation,
but that will also last until the next line break only.
.ti -10n
Reducing by more than the current offset
starts the next line at the physical left margin.
