Needed by about four dozen ports (thanks to naddy@@ for the research).

@.TH TI-BASIC-MAN 1 "May 8, 2014" OpenBSD
.SH NAME
ti-basic-man \- temporary indentation in man(7)
.SH DESCRIPTION
initial text
.ti 10n
This text is indented.
However, the indent is temporary,
so as soon as the line wraps, it is gone.
.ti +10n
The temporary indent can be relative.
All the same, it will expire in the usual way.
.ti -3n
It is also possible to temporarily reduce the indentation,
but that will also last until the next line break only.
.ti -10n
Reducing by more than the current offset
starts the next line at the physical left margin.
