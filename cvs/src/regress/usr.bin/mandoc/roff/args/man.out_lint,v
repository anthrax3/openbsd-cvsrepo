@Now that we have the -Wstyle message level, downgrade six warnings
that are not syntax mistakes and that do not cause wrong formatting
or content to style suggestions.
Also upgrade two warnings that may cause information loss to errors.

@Messages of the -Wbase level now print STYLE:.  Since this
causes horrible churn anyway, profit of the opportunity to stop
excessive testing, such that this is hopefully the last instance
of such churn.  Consistently use OpenBSD RCS tags, blank .Os,
blank fourth .TH argument, and Mdocdate like everywhere else.
Use -Ios=OpenBSD for platform-independent predictable output.

@Escape sequences terminate high-level macro names, and when doing so,
they are ignored, just in the same way as for request names
and for low-level macro names.
This also cures a warning in the pod2man(1) preamble.
