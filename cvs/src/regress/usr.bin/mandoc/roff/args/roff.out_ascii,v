@Complete overhaul of the mandoc(1) test suite.
* Test the recently introduced -Tman output mode, too.
* Specify date and OS arguments in all tests.
* Remove the kludge of sed(1)ing away the page footer lines.
* New make(1) variables SKIP_TMAN, SKIP_GROFF.
* Drop obsolete, clumsy make(1) variable GROFF_TARGETS.
* Delete obsolete mdoc/Bl/E*.sh error reporting tests.
* Silence char/N/basic.
* New targets:
- ascii, ascii-clean - to run -Tascii tests only
- tman, tman-clean - to run the new -Tman tests only
- obj-clean - maintainer only, needed before groff-clean and groff
- groff-clean - maintainer only, affects checked-in files

1.1
log
@Unify roff macro argument parsing (in roff.c, roff_userdef()) and man macro
argument parsing (in man_argv.c, man_args()), both having different bugs,
to use one common macro argument parser (in mandoc.c, mandoc_getarg()),
because from the point of view of roff, man macros are just roff macros,
hence their arguments are parsed in exactly the same way.

While doing so, fix these bugs:
 * Escaped blanks (i.e. those preceded by an odd number of backslashes)
   were mishandled as argument separators in unquoted arguments to
   user-defined roff macros.
 * Unescaped blanks preceded by an even number of backslashes were not
   recognized as argument separators in unquoted arguments to man macros.
 * Escaped backslashes (i.e. pairs of backslashes) were not reduced
   to single backslashes both in unquoted and quoted arguments both
   to user-defined roff macros and to man macros.
 * Escaped quotes (i.e. pairs of quotes inside quoted arguments) were
   not reduced to single quotes in man macros.

OK kristaps@@

Note that mdoc macro argument parsing is yet another beast for no good
reason and is probably afflicted by similar bugs.  But i don't attempt
to fix that right now because it is intricately entangled with lots of
unrelated high-level mdoc(7) functionality, like delimiter handling and
column list phrase handling.  Disentagling that would waste too much
time now.
