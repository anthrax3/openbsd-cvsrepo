log
@Messages of the -Wbase level now print STYLE:.  Since this
causes horrible churn anyway, profit of the opportunity to stop
excessive testing, such that this is hopefully the last instance
of such churn.  Consistently use OpenBSD RCS tags, blank .Os,
blank fourth .TH argument, and Mdocdate like everywhere else.
Use -Ios=OpenBSD for platform-independent predictable output.

1.1
log
@Basic implementation of the roff(7) .ta (define tab stops) request.
This is the first feature made possible by the parser reorganization.
Improves the formatting of the SYNOPSIS in many Xenocara GL manuals.
Also important for ports, as reported by many, including naddy@@.
