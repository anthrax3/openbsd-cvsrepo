log
@Messages of the -Wbase level now print STYLE:.  Since this
causes horrible churn anyway, profit of the opportunity to stop
excessive testing, such that this is hopefully the last instance
of such churn.  Consistently use OpenBSD RCS tags, blank .Os,
blank fourth .TH argument, and Mdocdate like everywhere else.
Use -Ios=OpenBSD for platform-independent predictable output.

@Naive implementation of the roff(7) .po (page offset) request.

This clearly works when .po is called on the top level, but might
not be sophisticated enough if people call .po inside indentation-changing
contexts, but i haven't seen that in manual pages (yet :).
