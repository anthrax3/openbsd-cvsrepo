@In roff_cond_sub(), make sure that the incorrect input sequence `\\}',
when found on a macro line, does not close a conditional block.
The companion function roff_cond_text() already did this correctly,
but make the code more readable without functional change.
While here, report the correct column number in related error messages.

1.6
log
@Three bugfixes related to the closing of conditional blocks:
1. Handle more than one `\}' on macro lines, as it was already done
for text lines.
2. Do not treat `\}' as a macro invocation after a dot at the beginning
of a line.  That allows more than one `\}' to work on lines starting
with `.\}'.  It also simplifies the code.
3. Do not complain about characters following `\}'.  Those are not lost,
but handled normally both on text and macro lines.

1.5
log
@Fix blank line handling in .if.

In particular, two cases were wrong:
 - single-line .if with trailing whitespace gave no blank line
 - multiline .if with \{ but without \{\ gave no blank line

While here, simplify roff_cond() by partially reordering the code.

@Complete overhaul of the mandoc(1) test suite.
* Test the recently introduced -Tman output mode, too.
* Specify date and OS arguments in all tests.
* Remove the kludge of sed(1)ing away the page footer lines.
* New make(1) variables SKIP_TMAN, SKIP_GROFF.
* Drop obsolete, clumsy make(1) variable GROFF_TARGETS.
* Delete obsolete mdoc/Bl/E*.sh error reporting tests.
* Silence char/N/basic.
* New targets:
- ascii, ascii-clean - to run -Tascii tests only
- tman, tman-clean - to run the new -Tman tests only
- obj-clean - maintainer only, needed before groff-clean and groff
- groff-clean - maintainer only, affects checked-in files
