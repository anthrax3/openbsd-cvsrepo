1.1
log
@Improve .if/.ie condition handling.
* Support string comparisons.
* Support negation not only for numerical, but for all conditions.
* Switch the `o' condition from false to true.
* Handle the `c', `d', and `r' conditions as false for now.
* Use int for boolean data instead of rolling our own "enum roffrule";
needed such that we can use the standard ! and == operators.

Havard Eidnes reported via the NetBSD bug tracking system that some
Tcl*(3) manuals need this, and Thomas Klausner <wiz at NetBSD>
forwarded the report to me.  This doesn't make the crazy Tcl*(3)
macrology maze happy yet, but brings us a bit closer.
