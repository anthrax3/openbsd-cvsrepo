log
@Messages of the -Wbase level now print STYLE:.  Since this
causes horrible churn anyway, profit of the opportunity to stop
excessive testing, such that this is hopefully the last instance
of such churn.  Consistently use OpenBSD RCS tags, blank .Os,
blank fourth .TH argument, and Mdocdate like everywhere else.
Use -Ios=OpenBSD for platform-independent predictable output.

.Nm if-before-Dd
.Nd end of if block on its own line before Dd
.Sh DESCRIPTION
In an old version of
.Xr mandoc 1 ,
.Xr mdoc 7
file format autodetection failed when the end of an
.Ic if
block stood on its own line before the initial
.Xr mdoc 7
.Ic Dd
macro.
The file was mishandled as
.Xr man 7
and parsing failed with unknown macro errors.
.Pp
If the present document looks like a proper
.Xr mdoc 7
document and the following display reads
.Dq mytext ,
then the problem did not come back:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
\*[mystring]
