log
@Messages of the -Wbase level now print STYLE:.  Since this
causes horrible churn anyway, profit of the opportunity to stop
excessive testing, such that this is hopefully the last instance
of such churn.  Consistently use OpenBSD RCS tags, blank .Os,
blank fourth .TH argument, and Mdocdate like everywhere else.
Use -Ios=OpenBSD for platform-independent predictable output.

@Cope with the changed order of warning and error messages caused by the
seperation of parsing and validation modules.  I originally intended to
mop this up when the parser reorg is complete, but since the work
stalled a bit, i should not leave this lying around broken for weeks.

1.1
log
@Cleanup with respect to bad macro arguments.
* Fix .Sm with invalid arg: move arg out and toggle mode.
* Promote "unknown standard" from WARNING to ERROR, it loses information.
* Delete MANDOCERR_BADWIDTH, it would only indicate a mandoc(1) bug.
* Do not report MANDOCERR_BL_LATETYPE when there is no type at all.
* Mention macro names, arguments and fallbacks.
