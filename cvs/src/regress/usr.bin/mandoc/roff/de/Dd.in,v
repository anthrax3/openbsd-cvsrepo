@In groff, trying to redefine standard man(7) macros before .TH has no effect;
after .TH, it works.  Trying to redefine standard mdoc(7) macros before .Dd
works when calling groff with the -mdoc command line option, but does not
when calling groff with -mandoc; after .Dd, it always works.

Arguably, one might call that buggy behaviour in groff, but it is very
unlikely that anybody will change groff in this respect (certainly, i'm
not volunteering).  So let's be bug-compatible.

This fixes the vertical spacing in sox(1).
