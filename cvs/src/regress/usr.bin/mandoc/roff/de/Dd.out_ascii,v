@Messages of the -Wbase level now print STYLE:.  Since this
causes horrible churn anyway, profit of the opportunity to stop
excessive testing, such that this is hopefully the last instance
of such churn.  Consistently use OpenBSD RCS tags, blank .Os,
blank fourth .TH argument, and Mdocdate like everywhere else.
Use -Ios=OpenBSD for platform-independent predictable output.

@In groff, trying to redefine standard man(7) macros before .TH has no effect;
after .TH, it works.  Trying to redefine standard mdoc(7) macros before .Dd
works when calling groff with the -mdoc command line option, but does not
when calling groff with -mandoc; after .Dd, it always works.

Arguably, one might call that buggy behaviour in groff, but it is very
unlikely that anybody will change groff in this respect (certainly, i'm
not volunteering).  So let's be bug-compatible.

This fixes the vertical spacing in sox(1).
