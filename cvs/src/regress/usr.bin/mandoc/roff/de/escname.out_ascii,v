@Messages of the -Wbase level now print STYLE:.  Since this
causes horrible churn anyway, profit of the opportunity to stop
excessive testing, such that this is hopefully the last instance
of such churn.  Consistently use OpenBSD RCS tags, blank .Os,
blank fourth .TH argument, and Mdocdate like everywhere else.
Use -Ios=OpenBSD for platform-independent predictable output.

@Many people have been complaining for a long time that ``...'' looks
ugly in -Tascii output.  For that reason, bentley@@ submitted patches
to render "..." instead to groff in November 2014 (yes, more than
two years ago).  Carsten Kunze yesterday merged them for the upcoming
groff-1.22.4 release.  Yay!

Consequently, do the same in mandoc: Render \(Lq and \(Rq (which
are used for .Do, .Dq, .Lb, and .St) as '"' in -Tascii output.
All other output modes including -Tutf8 remain unchanged.

1.1
log
@Use the freshly improved roff_getname() function
for the main roff request parsing routine, roff_parse().

In request or macro invocations, escape sequences now terminate the
request or macro name; what follows is treated as arguments.  Besides,
the names of user-defined macros can now contain backslashes (eek!).
