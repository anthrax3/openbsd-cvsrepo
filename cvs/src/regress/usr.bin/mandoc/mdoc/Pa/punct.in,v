1.2
log
@Macro argument quoting does not prevent recognition of punctuation
and of called macros.

This bug affects almost all macros, and fixing it simplifies the
code.  It is amazing that the bogus ARGS_QWORD feature got implemented
in the first place, and then carrier along for more than eight years
without anybody ever noticing that it was pointless.

1.1
log
@Right after .Fl, a middle delimiter triggers an empty scope,
just like a closing delimiter.  This didn't work in groff-1.15,
but it now works in groff-1.22.

After being closed by delimiters, .Nm scopes do not reopen.

Do not suppress white space after .Fl if the next node is a text node
on the same input line; that can happen for middle delimiters.

Fixing an issue reported by jmc@@.
