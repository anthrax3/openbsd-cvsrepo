log
@Messages of the -Wbase level now print STYLE:.  Since this
causes horrible churn anyway, profit of the opportunity to stop
excessive testing, such that this is hopefully the last instance
of such churn.  Consistently use OpenBSD RCS tags, blank .Os,
blank fourth .TH argument, and Mdocdate like everywhere else.
Use -Ios=OpenBSD for platform-independent predictable output.

@Many people have been complaining for a long time that ``...'' looks
ugly in -Tascii output.  For that reason, bentley@@ submitted patches
to render "..." instead to groff in November 2014 (yes, more than
two years ago).  Carsten Kunze yesterday merged them for the upcoming
groff-1.22.4 release.  Yay!

Consequently, do the same in mandoc: Render \(Lq and \(Rq (which
are used for .Do, .Dq, .Lb, and .St) as '"' in -Tascii output.
All other output modes including -Tutf8 remain unchanged.

@Remove bulky, irrelevant library description string tables
not used by a single manual in OpenBSD and just print library names;
will remain in the portable version for use by FreeBSD and NetBSD.
Removes 150 lines from source tree and 16 Kilobytes (4%) from binary.

@Complete overhaul of the mandoc(1) test suite.
* Test the recently introduced -Tman output mode, too.
* Specify date and OS arguments in all tests.
* Remove the kludge of sed(1)ing away the page footer lines.
* New make(1) variables SKIP_TMAN, SKIP_GROFF.
* Drop obsolete, clumsy make(1) variable GROFF_TARGETS.
* Delete obsolete mdoc/Bl/E*.sh error reporting tests.
* Silence char/N/basic.
* New targets:
- ascii, ascii-clean - to run -Tascii tests only
- tman, tman-clean - to run the new -Tman tests only
- obj-clean - maintainer only, needed before groff-clean and groff
- groff-clean - maintainer only, affects checked-in files
