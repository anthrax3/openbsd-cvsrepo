log
@Many people have been complaining for a long time that ``...'' looks
ugly in -Tascii output.  For that reason, bentley@@ submitted patches
to render "..." instead to groff in November 2014 (yes, more than
two years ago).  Carsten Kunze yesterday merged them for the upcoming
groff-1.22.4 release.  Yay!

Consequently, do the same in mandoc: Render \(Lq and \(Rq (which
are used for .Do, .Dq, .Lb, and .St) as '"' in -Tascii output.
All other output modes including -Tutf8 remain unchanged.
