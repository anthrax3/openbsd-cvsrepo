     UUxx--eeooss - end of sentence spacing after Unix macros

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     In the beginning Ken and Dennis wrote UNIX.  The CSRG rewrote it to
     become BSD.  When it dissolved, people started BSD/OS.  And NetBSD.  And
     FreeBSD.  And OpenBSD.  And DragonFly.  By now, it's free for everyone.
