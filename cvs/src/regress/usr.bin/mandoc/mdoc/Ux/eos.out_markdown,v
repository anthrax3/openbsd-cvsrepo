log
@Messages of the -Wbase level now print STYLE:.  Since this
causes horrible churn anyway, profit of the opportunity to stop
excessive testing, such that this is hopefully the last instance
of such churn.  Consistently use OpenBSD RCS tags, blank .Os,
blank fourth .TH argument, and Mdocdate like everywhere else.
Use -Ios=OpenBSD for platform-independent predictable output.

@UX-EOS(1) - General Commands Manual

# NAME

**Ux-eos** - end of sentence spacing after Unix macros

# DESCRIPTION

In the beginning Ken and Dennis wrote
UNIX.
The CSRG rewrote it to become
BSD.
When it dissolved, people started
BSD/OS.
And
NetBSD.
And
FreeBSD.
And
OpenBSD.
And
DragonFly.
By now, it's free for everyone.
