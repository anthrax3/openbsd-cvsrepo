@Messages of the -Wbase level now print STYLE:.  Since this
causes horrible churn anyway, profit of the opportunity to stop
excessive testing, such that this is hopefully the last instance
of such churn.  Consistently use OpenBSD RCS tags, blank .Os,
blank fourth .TH argument, and Mdocdate like everywhere else.
Use -Ios=OpenBSD for platform-independent predictable output.

log
@We don't do hyphenation, but we allow breaking the line at hyphens that are
already there in the middle of words.  So far, we only allowed this on text
lines.  Now it turns out some macros allow this for their arguments, too,
in particular .Nd and most of the .%? citation macros.

Issue found by Franco Fichtner <franco at lastsummer dot de> while doing
systematic groff-mandoc comparisons in the DragonFly base system, THANKS!

While here, garbage collect two empty prevalidator function pointer lists
and sort a couple of function declarations.
