log
@As suggested by jmc@@, only include line and column numbers into messages
when they are meaningful, to avoid confusing stuff like this:
$ mandoc /dev/null
mandoc: /dev/null:0:1: FATAL: not a manual
Instead, just say:
mandoc: /dev/null: FATAL: not a manual

Another example this applies to is documents having a prologue,
but lacking a body.  Do not throw a FATAL error for these; instead,
issue a warning and show the empty document, in the man(7) case with
the same amount of blank lines as groff does.  Also downgrade mdoc(7)
documents having content before the first .Sh from FATAL to WARNING.
