log
@Messages of the -Wbase level now print STYLE:.  Since this
causes horrible churn anyway, profit of the opportunity to stop
excessive testing, such that this is hopefully the last instance
of such churn.  Consistently use OpenBSD RCS tags, blank .Os,
blank fourth .TH argument, and Mdocdate like everywhere else.
Use -Ios=OpenBSD for platform-independent predictable output.

@Cope with the changed order of warning and error messages caused by the
seperation of parsing and validation modules.  I originally intended to
mop this up when the parser reorg is complete, but since the work
stalled a bit, i should not leave this lying around broken for weeks.
