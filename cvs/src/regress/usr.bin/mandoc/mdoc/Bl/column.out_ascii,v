@Messages of the -Wbase level now print STYLE:.  Since this
causes horrible churn anyway, profit of the opportunity to stop
excessive testing, such that this is hopefully the last instance
of such churn.  Consistently use OpenBSD RCS tags, blank .Os,
blank fourth .TH argument, and Mdocdate like everywhere else.
Use -Ios=OpenBSD for platform-independent predictable output.

@Very tricky diff to fix macro interpretation and spacing around tabs
in .Bl -column; it took me more than a day to get this right.
Triggered by a loosely related bug report from tim@@.

The lesson for you is:  Use .Ta macros in .Bl -column, avoid tabs,
or you are in for surprises:  The last word before a tab is not
interpreted as a macro (unless there is a blank in between), the
first word after a tab isn't either (unless there is a blank in
between), and a blank after a tab causes a leading blank in the
respective output cell.  Yes, "blank", "tab", "blank tab" and "tab
blank" all have different semantics; if you write code relying on
that, good luck maintaining it afterwards...

@Complete overhaul of the mandoc(1) test suite.
* Test the recently introduced -Tman output mode, too.
* Specify date and OS arguments in all tests.
* Remove the kludge of sed(1)ing away the page footer lines.
* New make(1) variables SKIP_TMAN, SKIP_GROFF.
* Drop obsolete, clumsy make(1) variable GROFF_TARGETS.
* Delete obsolete mdoc/Bl/E*.sh error reporting tests.
* Silence char/N/basic.
* New targets:
- ascii, ascii-clean - to run -Tascii tests only
- tman, tman-clean - to run the new -Tman tests only
- obj-clean - maintainer only, needed before groff-clean and groff
- groff-clean - maintainer only, affects checked-in files
