@Messages of the -Wbase level now print STYLE:.  Since this
causes horrible churn anyway, profit of the opportunity to stop
excessive testing, such that this is hopefully the last instance
of such churn.  Consistently use OpenBSD RCS tags, blank .Os,
blank fourth .TH argument, and Mdocdate like everywhere else.
Use -Ios=OpenBSD for platform-independent predictable output.

1.4
log
@When the head of a list item is extended with a partial explicit
macro (for example .Xo) and never closed again, the item ends up
without a body block.  This can even happen for list types that
usually don't have heads in the first place.  So even in this
case, check for the existence of the body before accessing it.

1.3
log
@The code is already careful to not add items to lists that were
already closed.  In this respect, also consider lists closed
that have broken another block, their closure pending until the
end of the broken block.  This avoids syntax tree corruption
leading to a NULL pointer access found by jsg@@ with afl.

Note that .It and .Nm blocks without bodies cannot be generated by

1.1
log
@Fix a crash triggered by .Bl -tag .It Xo .El .Sh found by florian@@.

* When allocating a body end marker, copy the pointer to the normalized
block information from the body block, avoiding the risk of subsequent
null pointer derefence.
* When inserting the body end marker into the syntax tree, do not try to
copy that pointer from the parent block, because not being a direkt child
of the block it belongs to is the whole point of a body end marker.
* Even non-callable blocks (like Bd and Bl) can break other blocks;
when this happens, postpone closing them out in the usual way.
