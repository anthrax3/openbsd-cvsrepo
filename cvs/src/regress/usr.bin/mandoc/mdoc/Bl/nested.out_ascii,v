@Messages of the -Wbase level now print STYLE:.  Since this
causes horrible churn anyway, profit of the opportunity to stop
excessive testing, such that this is hopefully the last instance
of such churn.  Consistently use OpenBSD RCS tags, blank .Os,
blank fourth .TH argument, and Mdocdate like everywhere else.
Use -Ios=OpenBSD for platform-independent predictable output.

@Support .Bl -offset in -mdoc -Tman.
Issue found when Thomas Klausner <wiz at NetBSD dot org> made me
look at the manuals of his http://www.nih.at/libzip library.

@Rewrite indentation handling for nested lists in a more systematic way
to fix multiple issues reported by Todd Miller; thanks!

Specifically,
 - avoid double indentation after .Bd inside .Bl
 - set up correct indentation after .Bl inside .Bl
 - set up correct indentation after .Dl and .D1 inside .Bl

While here, also
 - set up correct indentation *inside* .Dl and .D1 inside .Bl.

log
@Complete overhaul of the mandoc(1) test suite.
* Test the recently introduced -Tman output mode, too.
* Specify date and OS arguments in all tests.
* Remove the kludge of sed(1)ing away the page footer lines.
* New make(1) variables SKIP_TMAN, SKIP_GROFF.
* Drop obsolete, clumsy make(1) variable GROFF_TARGETS.
* Delete obsolete mdoc/Bl/E*.sh error reporting tests.
* Silence char/N/basic.
* New targets:
- ascii, ascii-clean - to run -Tascii tests only
- tman, tman-clean - to run the new -Tman tests only
- obj-clean - maintainer only, needed before groff-clean and groff
- groff-clean - maintainer only, affects checked-in files

such that the regression suite does not depend on ports.
