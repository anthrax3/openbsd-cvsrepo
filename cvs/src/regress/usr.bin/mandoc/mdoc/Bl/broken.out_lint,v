@Delete the mdoc_node.pending pointer and the function calculating
it, make_pending(), which was the most difficult function of the
whole mdoc(7) parser.  After almost five years of maintaining this
hellhole, i just noticed the pointer isn't needed after all.

Blocks are always rewound in the reverse order they were opened;
that even holds for broken blocks.  Consequently, it is sufficient
to just mark broken blogs with the flag MDOC_BROKEN and breaking
blocks with the flag MDOC_ENDED.  When rewinding, instead of iterating
the pending pointers, just iterate from each broken block to its
parents, rewinding all that are MDOC_ENDED and stopping after
processing the first ancestor that it not MDOC_BROKEN.  For ENDBODY
markers, use the mdoc_node.body pointer in place of the former
mdoc_node.pending.

This also fixes an assertion failure found by jsg@@ with afl,
test case #467 (Bo Bl It Bd Bc It), where (surprise surprise)
the pending pointer got corrupted.

Improved functionality, minus one function, minus one struct field,
minus 50 lines of code.

@Simplify: Do not call rew_dohalt() from make_pending(),
the calling macro handler already found the breaking block.
No functional change except tiny variations in error messages.

@Clean up warnings related to macros and nesting.
* Hierarchical naming of enum mandocerr items.
* Improve the wording to make it comprehensible.
* Mention the offending macro.
