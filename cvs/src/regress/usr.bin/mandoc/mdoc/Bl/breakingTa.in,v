log
@Messages of the -Wbase level now print STYLE:.  Since this
causes horrible churn anyway, profit of the opportunity to stop
excessive testing, such that this is hopefully the last instance
of such churn.  Consistently use OpenBSD RCS tags, blank .Os,
blank fourth .TH argument, and Mdocdate like everywhere else.
Use -Ios=OpenBSD for platform-independent predictable output.

@Surprisingly, groff does not support scaling units in .Bl -column
column width specifiers, so stop supporting them, too.
As a side effect, this fixes an assertion failure that tb@@ found
with afl(1), triggered by: .Bl -column -4n
