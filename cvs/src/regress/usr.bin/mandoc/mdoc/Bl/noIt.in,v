log
@Messages of the -Wbase level now print STYLE:.  Since this
causes horrible churn anyway, profit of the opportunity to stop
excessive testing, such that this is hopefully the last instance
of such churn.  Consistently use OpenBSD RCS tags, blank .Os,
blank fourth .TH argument, and Mdocdate like everywhere else.
Use -Ios=OpenBSD for platform-independent predictable output.

log
@If there is random stuff inside a .Bl block body before the first .It,
do not throw a FATAL error and do not die, but just throw a WARNING
and move the stuff out of the .Bl block.

This bug felt completely 2008-ish; meanwhile, such bugs from the
Kristaps-doesnt-like-syntax-errors-so-lets-just-give-up--Era
are becoming rare, but this was one of the last survivors.

Thanks to bentley@@ for reminding me to finally fix this.
