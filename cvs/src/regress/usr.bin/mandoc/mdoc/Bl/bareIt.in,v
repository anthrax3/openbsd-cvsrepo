log
@Messages of the -Wbase level now print STYLE:.  Since this
causes horrible churn anyway, profit of the opportunity to stop
excessive testing, such that this is hopefully the last instance
of such churn.  Consistently use OpenBSD RCS tags, blank .Os,
blank fourth .TH argument, and Mdocdate like everywhere else.
Use -Ios=OpenBSD for platform-independent predictable output.

@If a stray .It follows .El, we are no longer in the list,
even though the list is still the last processed macro.
This fixes a regression introduced in mdoc_macro.c rev. 1.95:
Ulrich Spoerlein <uqs at FreeBSD> reports that various of their
kernel manuals trigger assertions.
