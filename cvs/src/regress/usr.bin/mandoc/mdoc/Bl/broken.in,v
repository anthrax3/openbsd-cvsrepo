1.2
log
@Delete the mdoc_node.pending pointer and the function calculating
it, make_pending(), which was the most difficult function of the
whole mdoc(7) parser.  After almost five years of maintaining this
hellhole, i just noticed the pointer isn't needed after all.

Blocks are always rewound in the reverse order they were opened;
that even holds for broken blocks.  Consequently, it is sufficient
to just mark broken blogs with the flag MDOC_BROKEN and breaking
blocks with the flag MDOC_ENDED.  When rewinding, instead of iterating
the pending pointers, just iterate from each broken block to its
parents, rewinding all that are MDOC_ENDED and stopping after
processing the first ancestor that it not MDOC_BROKEN.  For ENDBODY
markers, use the mdoc_node.body pointer in place of the former
mdoc_node.pending.

This also fixes an assertion failure found by jsg@@ with afl,
test case #467 (Bo Bl It Bd Bc It), where (surprise surprise)
the pending pointer got corrupted.

Improved functionality, minus one function, minus one struct field,
minus 50 lines of code.

log
@Fix a crash triggered by .Bl -tag .It Xo .El .Sh found by florian@@.

* When allocating a body end marker, copy the pointer to the normalized
block information from the body block, avoiding the risk of subsequent
null pointer derefence.
* When inserting the body end marker into the syntax tree, do not try to
copy that pointer from the parent block, because not being a direkt child
of the block it belongs to is the whole point of a body end marker.
* Even non-callable blocks (like Bd and Bl) can break other blocks;
when this happens, postpone closing them out in the usual way.
