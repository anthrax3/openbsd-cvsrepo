log
@Messages of the -Wbase level now print STYLE:.  Since this
causes horrible churn anyway, profit of the opportunity to stop
excessive testing, such that this is hopefully the last instance
of such churn.  Consistently use OpenBSD RCS tags, blank .Os,
blank fourth .TH argument, and Mdocdate like everywhere else.
Use -Ios=OpenBSD for platform-independent predictable output.

log
@If a column list starts with implicit rows (that is, rows without .It)
and roff-level nodes (e.g. tbl or eqn) follow, don't run into an
assertion.  Instead, wrap the roff-level nodes in their own row.
