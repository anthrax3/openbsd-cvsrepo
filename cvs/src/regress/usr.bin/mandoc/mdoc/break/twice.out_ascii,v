log
@Messages of the -Wbase level now print STYLE:.  Since this
causes horrible churn anyway, profit of the opportunity to stop
excessive testing, such that this is hopefully the last instance
of such churn.  Consistently use OpenBSD RCS tags, blank .Os,
blank fourth .TH argument, and Mdocdate like everywhere else.
Use -Ios=OpenBSD for platform-independent predictable output.

@Fix block scoping error if an explicit block is broken by two
implicit blocks (.Aq Bq Po .Pc) that left the outer breaker open
and could in exceptional cases, like between .Bl and .It, cause
tree corruption leading to NULL dereference.
Found by tb@@ with afl(1).

While here, do not mark intermediate ENDBODY markers as broken.

log
@The code already pays attention not to close the same block twice.
Similarly, avoid having the same block break two other blocks.
In some situations, this could lead to an endless loop in rew_sub()
