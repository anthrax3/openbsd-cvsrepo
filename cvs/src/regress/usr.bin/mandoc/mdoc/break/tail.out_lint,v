1.7
log
@Messages of the -Wbase level now print STYLE:.  Since this
causes horrible churn anyway, profit of the opportunity to stop
excessive testing, such that this is hopefully the last instance
of such churn.  Consistently use OpenBSD RCS tags, blank .Os,
blank fourth .TH argument, and Mdocdate like everywhere else.
Use -Ios=OpenBSD for platform-independent predictable output.

@Arguments to end macros of broken partial explicit blocks
must go inside the breaking block.  For example, in
.It Ic cmd Oo
.Ar optional_arg Oc Ar mandatory_arg
the mandatory_arg is still inside the .It block.
