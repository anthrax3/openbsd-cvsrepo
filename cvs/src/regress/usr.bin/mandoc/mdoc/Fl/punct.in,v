1.3
log
@Right after .Fl, a middle delimiter triggers an empty scope,
just like a closing delimiter.  This didn't work in groff-1.15,
but it now works in groff-1.22.

After being closed by delimiters, .Nm scopes do not reopen.

Do not suppress white space after .Fl if the next node is a text node
on the same input line; that can happen for middle delimiters.

Fixing an issue reported by jmc@@.

@Complete overhaul of the mandoc(1) test suite.
* Test the recently introduced -Tman output mode, too.
* Specify date and OS arguments in all tests.
* Remove the kludge of sed(1)ing away the page footer lines.
* New make(1) variables SKIP_TMAN, SKIP_GROFF.
* Drop obsolete, clumsy make(1) variable GROFF_TARGETS.
* Delete obsolete mdoc/Bl/E*.sh error reporting tests.
* Silence char/N/basic.
* New targets:
- ascii, ascii-clean - to run -Tascii tests only
- tman, tman-clean - to run the new -Tman tests only
- obj-clean - maintainer only, needed before groff-clean and groff
- groff-clean - maintainer only, affects checked-in files
