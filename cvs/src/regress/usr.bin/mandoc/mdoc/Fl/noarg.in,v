log
@Messages of the -Wbase level now print STYLE:.  Since this
causes horrible churn anyway, profit of the opportunity to stop
excessive testing, such that this is hopefully the last instance
of such churn.  Consistently use OpenBSD RCS tags, blank .Os,
blank fourth .TH argument, and Mdocdate like everywhere else.
Use -Ios=OpenBSD for platform-independent predictable output.

.Nm Fl-noarg
.Nd Fl macro without arguments
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Without an argument, it yields
.Fl
a dash.
.Pp
This is true even before middle
.Fl | and
trailing punctuation
.Fl .
.Pp
Following macros
.Fl Op flag
follow without white space.

log
@Right after .Fl, a middle delimiter triggers an empty scope,
just like a closing delimiter.  This didn't work in groff-1.15,
but it now works in groff-1.22.

After being closed by delimiters, .Nm scopes do not reopen.

Do not suppress white space after .Fl if the next node is a text node
on the same input line; that can happen for middle delimiters.

Fixing an issue reported by jmc@@.

@Complete overhaul of the mandoc(1) test suite.
* Test the recently introduced -Tman output mode, too.
* Specify date and OS arguments in all tests.
* Remove the kludge of sed(1)ing away the page footer lines.
* New make(1) variables SKIP_TMAN, SKIP_GROFF.
* Drop obsolete, clumsy make(1) variable GROFF_TARGETS.
* Delete obsolete mdoc/Bl/E*.sh error reporting tests.
* Silence char/N/basic.
* New targets:
- ascii, ascii-clean - to run -Tascii tests only
- tman, tman-clean - to run the new -Tman tests only
- obj-clean - maintainer only, needed before groff-clean and groff
- groff-clean - maintainer only, affects checked-in files

@Make sure that the sequence .Fl, no argument, and another macro
is rendered without white space between the dash and the other macro.
Will be fixed in mandoc 1.9.23.

@When a .Fl macro without an argument is followed by text,
the space after the dash appears to be missing.  Needs fixing.
