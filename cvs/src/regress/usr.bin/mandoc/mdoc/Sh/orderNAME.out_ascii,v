log
@Messages of the -Wbase level now print STYLE:.  Since this
causes horrible churn anyway, profit of the opportunity to stop
excessive testing, such that this is hopefully the last instance
of such churn.  Consistently use OpenBSD RCS tags, blank .Os,
blank fourth .TH argument, and Mdocdate like everywhere else.
Use -Ios=OpenBSD for platform-independent predictable output.

@Stricter validation of the NAME section, in particular:
- require a comma between names
- reject all other text nodes
- reject all empty Nm below NAME, not only in the leading position
- reject Nm after Nd
