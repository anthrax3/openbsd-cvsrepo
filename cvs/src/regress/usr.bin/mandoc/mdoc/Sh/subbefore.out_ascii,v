@Do not test .Xr here.  It is not what this directory should focus on,
and it is causing too much trouble in -portable.

@Avoid cross reference to mandoc(1) because it may cause a message
on other operating systems where mandoc is not installed,
causing the test to fail in the portable test suite.

     Can man(1) on OpenBSD handle this?

log
@Messages of the -Wbase level now print STYLE:.  Since this
causes horrible churn anyway, profit of the opportunity to stop
excessive testing, such that this is hopefully the last instance
of such churn.  Consistently use OpenBSD RCS tags, blank .Os,
blank fourth .TH argument, and Mdocdate like everywhere else.
Use -Ios=OpenBSD for platform-independent predictable output.
