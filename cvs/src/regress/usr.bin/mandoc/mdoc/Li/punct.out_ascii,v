@Messages of the -Wbase level now print STYLE:.  Since this
causes horrible churn anyway, profit of the opportunity to stop
excessive testing, such that this is hopefully the last instance
of such churn.  Consistently use OpenBSD RCS tags, blank .Os,
blank fourth .TH argument, and Mdocdate like everywhere else.
Use -Ios=OpenBSD for platform-independent predictable output.

@Macro argument quoting does not prevent recognition of punctuation
and of called macros.

This bug affects almost all macros, and fixing it simplifies the
code.  It is amazing that the bogus ARGS_QWORD feature got implemented
in the first place, and then carrier along for more than eight years
without anybody ever noticing that it was pointless.

@Multiple fixes with respect to in-line macros:
* .No selects the default font; relevant e.g. in .Bf blocks
* no need to force empty .Li elements
* closing delimiters as leading macro arguments do not suppress space
* opening delimiters at the end of a macro line do not suppress space
* correctly handle delimiter spacing in -Tman
As a side effect, these fixes let mandoc warn about empty .No macros
as requested by bentley@@.

@Complete overhaul of the mandoc(1) test suite.
* Test the recently introduced -Tman output mode, too.
* Specify date and OS arguments in all tests.
* Remove the kludge of sed(1)ing away the page footer lines.
* New make(1) variables SKIP_TMAN, SKIP_GROFF.
* Drop obsolete, clumsy make(1) variable GROFF_TARGETS.
* Delete obsolete mdoc/Bl/E*.sh error reporting tests.
* Silence char/N/basic.
* New targets:
- ascii, ascii-clean - to run -Tascii tests only
- tman, tman-clean - to run the new -Tman tests only
- obj-clean - maintainer only, needed before groff-clean and groff
- groff-clean - maintainer only, affects checked-in files
