log
@Multiple fixes with respect to .Pf:
* The first argument of .Pf is not parsed.
* Normal delimiter handling does not apply to the first argument of .Pf.
* Warn if nothing follows a prefix (inspired by groff_mdoc(7)).
* In that case, do not suppress spacing.

.Os OpenBSD
.Sh NAME
.Nm Pf-spacing
.Nd spacing around the prefix macro
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Closing punctuation goes
.Pf . right .
But
.Pf . . double
prefixes don't work.
Opening punctuation goes
.Pf ( left .
But again, prefix
.Pf ( ) pairs
don't work.
Even normal text gets
.Pf pre fixed .
The first
.Pf Ar gument
is not parsed.
Nothing can be
.Pf prefixed
to the next line.
Trailing punctuation still counts as
.Em eos Pf .
.Po But it does not fall out of enclosures Pf . Pc
.Pp
It makes no sense at the very
.Em end Pf

log
@Complete overhaul of the mandoc(1) test suite.
* Test the recently introduced -Tman output mode, too.
* Specify date and OS arguments in all tests.
* Remove the kludge of sed(1)ing away the page footer lines.
* New make(1) variables SKIP_TMAN, SKIP_GROFF.
* Drop obsolete, clumsy make(1) variable GROFF_TARGETS.
* Delete obsolete mdoc/Bl/E*.sh error reporting tests.
* Silence char/N/basic.
* New targets:
- ascii, ascii-clean - to run -Tascii tests only
- tman, tman-clean - to run the new -Tman tests only
- obj-clean - maintainer only, needed before groff-clean and groff
- groff-clean - maintainer only, affects checked-in files
