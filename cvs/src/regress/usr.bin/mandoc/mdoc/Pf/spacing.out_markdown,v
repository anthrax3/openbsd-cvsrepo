log
@Messages of the -Wbase level now print STYLE:.  Since this
causes horrible churn anyway, profit of the opportunity to stop
excessive testing, such that this is hopefully the last instance
of such churn.  Consistently use OpenBSD RCS tags, blank .Os,
blank fourth .TH argument, and Mdocdate like everywhere else.
Use -Ios=OpenBSD for platform-independent predictable output.

@PF-SPACING(1) - General Commands Manual

# NAME

**Pf-spacing** - spacing around the prefix macro

# DESCRIPTION

Closing punctuation goes
.right.
But
.. double
prefixes don't work.
Opening punctuation goes
(left.
But again, prefix
() pairs
don't work.
Even normal text gets
prefixed.
The first
Argument
is not parsed.
Nothing can be
prefixed
to the next line.
Trailing punctuation still counts as
*eos* .
(But it does not fall out of enclosures .)

It makes no sense at the very
*end*
