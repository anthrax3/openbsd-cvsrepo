log
@Messages of the -Wbase level now print STYLE:.  Since this
causes horrible churn anyway, profit of the opportunity to stop
excessive testing, such that this is hopefully the last instance
of such churn.  Consistently use OpenBSD RCS tags, blank .Os,
blank fourth .TH argument, and Mdocdate like everywhere else.
Use -Ios=OpenBSD for platform-independent predictable output.

     PPff--ssppaacciinngg - spacing around the prefix macro

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     Closing punctuation goes .right.  But .. double prefixes don't work.
     Opening punctuation goes (left.  But again, prefix () pairs don't work.
     Even normal text gets prefixed.  The first Argument is not parsed.
     Nothing can be prefixed to the next line.  Trailing punctuation still
     counts as _e_o_s .  (But it does not fall out of enclosures .)

     It makes no sense at the very _e_n_d

@Multiple fixes with respect to .Pf:
* The first argument of .Pf is not parsed.
* Normal delimiter handling does not apply to the first argument of .Pf.
* Warn if nothing follows a prefix (inspired by groff_mdoc(7)).
* In that case, do not suppress spacing.

1.2
log
@Complete overhaul of the mandoc(1) test suite.
* Test the recently introduced -Tman output mode, too.
* Specify date and OS arguments in all tests.
* Remove the kludge of sed(1)ing away the page footer lines.
* New make(1) variables SKIP_TMAN, SKIP_GROFF.
* Drop obsolete, clumsy make(1) variable GROFF_TARGETS.
* Delete obsolete mdoc/Bl/E*.sh error reporting tests.
* Silence char/N/basic.
* New targets:
- ascii, ascii-clean - to run -Tascii tests only
- tman, tman-clean - to run the new -Tman tests only
- obj-clean - maintainer only, needed before groff-clean and groff
- groff-clean - maintainer only, affects checked-in files
