log
@Macro argument quoting does not prevent recognition of punctuation
and of called macros.

This bug affects almost all macros, and fixing it simplifies the
code.  It is amazing that the bogus ARGS_QWORD feature got implemented
in the first place, and then carrier along for more than eight years
without anybody ever noticing that it was pointless.
