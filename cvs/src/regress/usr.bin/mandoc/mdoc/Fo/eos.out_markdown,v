log
@Messages of the -Wbase level now print STYLE:.  Since this
causes horrible churn anyway, profit of the opportunity to stop
excessive testing, such that this is hopefully the last instance
of such churn.  Consistently use OpenBSD RCS tags, blank .Os,
blank fourth .TH argument, and Mdocdate like everywhere else.
Use -Ios=OpenBSD for platform-independent predictable output.

@FO-EOS(1) - General Commands Manual

# NAME

**Fo-eos** - end of sentence handling after a function block

# DESCRIPTION

As an example of a trigonometric function, let us consider
**double sin**(*double x*).
Or do you prefer
*double*
**cos**(*double*, *x*)
.
Either will do.
