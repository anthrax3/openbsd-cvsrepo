1.3
log
@Messages of the -Wbase level now print STYLE:.  Since this
causes horrible churn anyway, profit of the opportunity to stop
excessive testing, such that this is hopefully the last instance
of such churn.  Consistently use OpenBSD RCS tags, blank .Os,
blank fourth .TH argument, and Mdocdate like everywhere else.
Use -Ios=OpenBSD for platform-independent predictable output.

     The first sentence is Ingo's.  The second is Kristaps'.  No idea about
     the third.

1.1
log
@Two more macros (.Ap and .In) do trailing delimiter handling.
This fixes the end of sentence spacing in open(2)
and in about 150 pages in the NetBSD base system.

Reported by Nicolas Joly <njoly a pasteur point fr>, merci!
