log
@Messages of the -Wbase level now print STYLE:.  Since this
causes horrible churn anyway, profit of the opportunity to stop
excessive testing, such that this is hopefully the last instance
of such churn.  Consistently use OpenBSD RCS tags, blank .Os,
blank fourth .TH argument, and Mdocdate like everywhere else.
Use -Ios=OpenBSD for platform-independent predictable output.

@If a .Bd block has no arguments at all, drop the block and only keep
its contents.  Removing a gratuitious difference to groff output
found after a related bug report from krw@@.

@Downgrade .Bd -file from FATAL to ERROR.
Since this was the last remaining FATAL error in this area,
this change will allow major simplifications in the mdoc(7) parser.

@Cleanup with respect to bad macro arguments.
* Fix .Sm with invalid arg: move arg out and toggle mode.
* Promote "unknown standard" from WARNING to ERROR, it loses information.
* Delete MANDOCERR_BADWIDTH, it would only indicate a mandoc(1) bug.
* Do not report MANDOCERR_BL_LATETYPE when there is no type at all.
* Mention macro names, arguments and fallbacks.

@Cleanup regarding -offset and -width:
* Bugfix: Last one wins, not first one.
* Fix .Bl -width without argument: it means 0n, so do not ignore it.
* Report macro names, argument names and fallbacks in related messages.
* Simplify: Garbage collect auxiliary variables in pre_bd() and pre_bl().
