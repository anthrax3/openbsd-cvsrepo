@Fix a crash triggered by .Bl -tag .It Xo .El .Sh found by florian@@.

* When allocating a body end marker, copy the pointer to the normalized
block information from the body block, avoiding the risk of subsequent
null pointer derefence.
* When inserting the body end marker into the syntax tree, do not try to
copy that pointer from the parent block, because not being a direkt child
of the block it belongs to is the whole point of a body end marker.
* Even non-callable blocks (like Bd and Bl) can break other blocks;
when this happens, postpone closing them out in the usual way.
