1.2
log
@Messages of the -Wbase level now print STYLE:.  Since this
causes horrible churn anyway, profit of the opportunity to stop
excessive testing, such that this is hopefully the last instance
of such churn.  Consistently use OpenBSD RCS tags, blank .Os,
blank fourth .TH argument, and Mdocdate like everywhere else.
Use -Ios=OpenBSD for platform-independent predictable output.

1.1
log
@Support negative indentations for mdoc(7) displays and lists.
Not exactly recommended for use, rather for groff compatibility.
While here, introduce similar SHRT_MAX limits as in man(7),
fixing a few cases of infinite output found by jsg@@ with afl.
