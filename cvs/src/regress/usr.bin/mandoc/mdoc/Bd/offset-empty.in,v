1.5
log
@We repeatedly observed assertion crashes in the low-level terminal
output handler because the high level terminal formatters could be
tricked into setting the left margin further to the right than the
right margin.  Today, jsg@@ found more of these with afl.

Change the internal interface between both levels, aiming for
simplicity and robustness of the code.  Treat both margins as
*independent* settings:  Now, termp.offset is the requested left
margin, and termp.rmargin is the available space.  Let the lower
level cope with that case of insufficient space.

Obviously, high level code that does centering or flush right
still has to do careful checks, so i did a full audit of margin
settings in the terminal formatters.

Fixes crashes caused by excessively long title or date strings in
the man(7) footer, operating system or date strings in the mdoc(7)
footer, volume strings in the man(7) or mdoc(7) header, and a few
cases related to some non-prologue macros.

@Major bugsquashing with respect to -offset and -width:
1. Support specifying the .Bd and .Bl -offset as a macro default width;
while here, simplify the code handling the same for .Bl -width.
2. Correct handling of .Bl -offset arguments:  unlike .Bd -offset, the
arguments "left", "indent", and "indent-two" have no special meaning.
3. Fix the scaling of string length -offset and -width arguments in -Thtml.
Triggered by an incomplete documentation patch from bentley@@.

log
@Complete overhaul of the mandoc(1) test suite.
* Test the recently introduced -Tman output mode, too.
* Specify date and OS arguments in all tests.
* Remove the kludge of sed(1)ing away the page footer lines.
* New make(1) variables SKIP_TMAN, SKIP_GROFF.
* Drop obsolete, clumsy make(1) variable GROFF_TARGETS.
* Delete obsolete mdoc/Bl/E*.sh error reporting tests.
* Silence char/N/basic.
* New targets:
- ascii, ascii-clean - to run -Tascii tests only
- tman, tman-clean - to run the new -Tman tests only
- obj-clean - maintainer only, needed before groff-clean and groff
- groff-clean - maintainer only, affects checked-in files
