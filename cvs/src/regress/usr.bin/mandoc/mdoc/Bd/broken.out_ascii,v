@Messages of the -Wbase level now print STYLE:.  Since this
causes horrible churn anyway, profit of the opportunity to stop
excessive testing, such that this is hopefully the last instance
of such churn.  Consistently use OpenBSD RCS tags, blank .Os,
blank fourth .TH argument, and Mdocdate like everywhere else.
Use -Ios=OpenBSD for platform-independent predictable output.

@Fix a crash triggered by .Bl -tag .It Xo .El .Sh found by florian@@.

* When allocating a body end marker, copy the pointer to the normalized
block information from the body block, avoiding the risk of subsequent
null pointer derefence.
* When inserting the body end marker into the syntax tree, do not try to
copy that pointer from the parent block, because not being a direkt child
of the block it belongs to is the whole point of a body end marker.
* Even non-callable blocks (like Bd and Bl) can break other blocks;
when this happens, postpone closing them out in the usual way.
