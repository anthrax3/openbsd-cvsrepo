1.3
log
@Messages of the -Wbase level now print STYLE:.  Since this
causes horrible churn anyway, profit of the opportunity to stop
excessive testing, such that this is hopefully the last instance
of such churn.  Consistently use OpenBSD RCS tags, blank .Os,
blank fourth .TH argument, and Mdocdate like everywhere else.
Use -Ios=OpenBSD for platform-independent predictable output.

log
@Correct indentation for lists and displays inside lists.

Inspired by a diff from millert@@, but implemented rather
differently and with slightly better functionality.
In particular, this one respects -offset and -width
arguments found in the input file.
