log
@Messages of the -Wbase level now print STYLE:.  Since this
causes horrible churn anyway, profit of the opportunity to stop
excessive testing, such that this is hopefully the last instance
of such churn.  Consistently use OpenBSD RCS tags, blank .Os,
blank fourth .TH argument, and Mdocdate like everywhere else.
Use -Ios=OpenBSD for platform-independent predictable output.

1.1
log
@Do text production for .Bt, .Ex, .Rv, .Ud at the validation stage
rather than in the formatters.  Use NODE_NOSRC flag for .Lb and
NODE_NOSRC and NODE_NOPRT for .St.  Results in a more rigorous
syntax tree and in 135 lines less code.
