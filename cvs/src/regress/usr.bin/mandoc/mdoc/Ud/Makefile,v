log
@Now that markdown output is tested for almost everything, test all
input files in -T markdown output mode by default and only mark
those files with SKIP_MARKDOWN that are not to be tested.
Much easier to read, and almost minus 40 lines of Makefile code.

log
@Do text production for .Bt, .Ex, .Rv, .Ud at the validation stage
rather than in the formatters.  Use NODE_NOSRC flag for .Lb and
NODE_NOSRC and NODE_NOPRT for .St.  Results in a more rigorous
syntax tree and in 135 lines less code.
