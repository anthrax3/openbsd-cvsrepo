1.3
log
@Using macros in .Sh header lines, or having .Sm off or .Bk -words open
while processing .Sh, is not at all recommended, but it's not strictly
a syntax violation either, and in any case, mandoc must not die in an
assertion.  I broke this in rev. 1.124.

Crash found while trying to read the (rather broken) original 4.3BSD-Reno
od(1) manual page.

1.2
log
@Complete overhaul of the mandoc(1) test suite.
* Test the recently introduced -Tman output mode, too.
* Specify date and OS arguments in all tests.
* Remove the kludge of sed(1)ing away the page footer lines.
* New make(1) variables SKIP_TMAN, SKIP_GROFF.
* Drop obsolete, clumsy make(1) variable GROFF_TARGETS.
* Delete obsolete mdoc/Bl/E*.sh error reporting tests.
* Silence char/N/basic.
* New targets:
- ascii, ascii-clean - to run -Tascii tests only
- tman, tman-clean - to run the new -Tman tests only
- obj-clean - maintainer only, needed before groff-clean and groff
- groff-clean - maintainer only, affects checked-in files

log
@Now that we don't have groff in base any longer, check in the desired output,
such that the regression suite does not depend on ports.
