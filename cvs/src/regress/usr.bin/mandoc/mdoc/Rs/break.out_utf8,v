1.1
log
@Use typographic quotes rather than '"' for .Rs %T (no change for -Tascii
output, of course).  Patch from bentley@@ in November 2014.  This can be
committed now because groff merged Anthony's patch yesterday.

Simply committing myself because asking Anthony to go search for
his two-year-old patch and have him discover that it had accumulated
an average of (felt) two or three conflicts per line by now would
have been mean, even if hilarious.
