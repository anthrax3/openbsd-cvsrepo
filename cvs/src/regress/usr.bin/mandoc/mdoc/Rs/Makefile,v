@Now that markdown output is tested for almost everything, test all
input files in -T markdown output mode by default and only mark
those files with SKIP_MARKDOWN that are not to be tested.
Much easier to read, and almost minus 40 lines of Makefile code.

@Use typographic quotes rather than '"' for .Rs %T (no change for -Tascii
output, of course).  Patch from bentley@@ in November 2014.  This can be
committed now because groff merged Anthony's patch yesterday.

Simply committing myself because asking Anthony to go search for
his two-year-old patch and have him discover that it had accumulated
an average of (felt) two or three conflicts per line by now would
have been mean, even if hilarious.

@Complete overhaul of the mandoc(1) test suite.
* Test the recently introduced -Tman output mode, too.
* Specify date and OS arguments in all tests.
* Remove the kludge of sed(1)ing away the page footer lines.
* New make(1) variables SKIP_TMAN, SKIP_GROFF.
* Drop obsolete, clumsy make(1) variable GROFF_TARGETS.
* Delete obsolete mdoc/Bl/E*.sh error reporting tests.
* Silence char/N/basic.
* New targets:
- ascii, ascii-clean - to run -Tascii tests only
- tman, tman-clean - to run the new -Tman tests only
- obj-clean - maintainer only, needed before groff-clean and groff
- groff-clean - maintainer only, affects checked-in files

log
@Add the first batch of mandoc(1) regression tests, testing for a few bugs
fixed in 1.9.9 and some older, rather subtle issues in list displays.

Directory layout and naming scheme was chosen such that later inclusion
of tests for -man and -Thtml will not force us to rename everything,
even though the layout might still seem a bit sparse right now.
More tests will slowly be added while investigating and fixing issues.
