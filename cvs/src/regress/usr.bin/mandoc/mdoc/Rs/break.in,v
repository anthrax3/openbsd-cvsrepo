@Messages of the -Wbase level now print STYLE:.  Since this
causes horrible churn anyway, profit of the opportunity to stop
excessive testing, such that this is hopefully the last instance
of such churn.  Consistently use OpenBSD RCS tags, blank .Os,
blank fourth .TH argument, and Mdocdate like everywhere else.
Use -Ios=OpenBSD for platform-independent predictable output.

@Using macros in .Sh header lines, or having .Sm off or .Bk -words open
while processing .Sh, is not at all recommended, but it's not strictly
a syntax violation either, and in any case, mandoc must not die in an
assertion.  I broke this in rev. 1.124.

Crash found while trying to read the (rather broken) original 4.3BSD-Reno
od(1) manual page.

@Complete overhaul of the mandoc(1) test suite.
* Test the recently introduced -Tman output mode, too.
* Specify date and OS arguments in all tests.
* Remove the kludge of sed(1)ing away the page footer lines.
* New make(1) variables SKIP_TMAN, SKIP_GROFF.
* Drop obsolete, clumsy make(1) variable GROFF_TARGETS.
* Delete obsolete mdoc/Bl/E*.sh error reporting tests.
* Silence char/N/basic.
* New targets:
- ascii, ascii-clean - to run -Tascii tests only
- tman, tman-clean - to run the new -Tman tests only
- obj-clean - maintainer only, needed before groff-clean and groff
- groff-clean - maintainer only, affects checked-in files

1.1
log
@Add the first batch of mandoc(1) regression tests, testing for a few bugs
fixed in 1.9.9 and some older, rather subtle issues in list displays.

Directory layout and naming scheme was chosen such that later inclusion
of tests for -man and -Thtml will not force us to rename everything,
even though the layout might still seem a bit sparse right now.
More tests will slowly be added while investigating and fixing issues.
