log
@In markdown, autolinks are dangerous.  Different compilers disagree
with respect to what constitutes a valid autolink, and if a compiler
deems an autolink invalid, the input turns into an unintended and
potentially harmful raw HTML tag.  So, never write autolinks.
Instead of <link>, write [link](link).
Instead of <addr>, write [addr](mailto:addr).

Issue pointed out by bentley@@, who also agrees with the general
direction of the change.
