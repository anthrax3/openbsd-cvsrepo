1.2
log
@Messages of the -Wbase level now print STYLE:.  Since this
causes horrible churn anyway, profit of the opportunity to stop
excessive testing, such that this is hopefully the last instance
of such churn.  Consistently use OpenBSD RCS tags, blank .Os,
blank fourth .TH argument, and Mdocdate like everywhere else.
Use -Ios=OpenBSD for platform-independent predictable output.

log
@Use typographic quotes rather than '"' for .Rs %T (no change for -Tascii
output, of course).  Patch from bentley@@ in November 2014.  This can be
committed now because groff merged Anthony's patch yesterday.

Simply committing myself because asking Anthony to go search for
his two-year-old patch and have him discover that it had accumulated
an average of (felt) two or three conflicts per line by now would
have been mean, even if hilarious.
