1.7
log
@Messages of the -Wbase level now print STYLE:.  Since this
causes horrible churn anyway, profit of the opportunity to stop
excessive testing, such that this is hopefully the last instance
of such churn.  Consistently use OpenBSD RCS tags, blank .Os,
blank fourth .TH argument, and Mdocdate like everywhere else.
Use -Ios=OpenBSD for platform-independent predictable output.

1.1
log
@Multiple fixes with respect to .Eo:
1. Correctly parse stray .Ec without preceding .Eo,
avoiding an assertion violation found by jsg@@ with afl.
2. Correctly parse .Ec arguments when breaking another block.
3. Correct spacing around closing delimiter when breaking another block.
4. Sync some related formatting control from -Tascii to -Thtml.
