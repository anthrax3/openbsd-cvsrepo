@Infrastructure for regression tests of mandoc messages.
Even though messages are not going to be as stable as formatted output,
that is, even though the *.out_lint files are expected to change now and then,
from now on, i want to be able to catch unintended changes in messages.

1.7
log
@Complete overhaul of the mandoc(1) test suite.
* Test the recently introduced -Tman output mode, too.
* Specify date and OS arguments in all tests.
* Remove the kludge of sed(1)ing away the page footer lines.
* New make(1) variables SKIP_TMAN, SKIP_GROFF.
* Drop obsolete, clumsy make(1) variable GROFF_TARGETS.
* Delete obsolete mdoc/Bl/E*.sh error reporting tests.
* Silence char/N/basic.
* New targets:
- ascii, ascii-clean - to run -Tascii tests only
- tman, tman-clean - to run the new -Tman tests only
- obj-clean - maintainer only, needed before groff-clean and groff
- groff-clean - maintainer only, affects checked-in files

@Theo reported that make cleandir deleted too much, triggering this cleanup:

Since quite some time, the groff output files are checked into CVS.
* thus, no longer provide a "groff-clean" target to delete them
* from official targets, no longer call the "groff" target generating them
* do not reimplement "clean" and "cleandir", simply use the official targets

1.5
log
@Multiple man(7) .IP and .TP fixes started during p2k10:

Affecting both -Tascii and -Thtml:
* The .IP HEAD uses the second argument as the width, not the last one.
* Only print the first .IP HEAD argument, not all but the last.

Affecting only -Tascii:
* The .IP and .TP HEADs must be printed without literal mode,
  but literal mode must be restored afterwards.
* After the .IP and .TP bodies, we only want term_newln(), not
  term_flushln(), or we would get two blank lines in literal mode.
* The .TP HEAD does not use TWOSPACE, just like .IP doesn't either.
* In literal mode, clear NOLPAD after each line, or subsequent lines
  would get no indentation whatsoever.

Affecting only -Thtml:
* Only print next-line .TP children, instead of all but the first.

OK kristaps@@ on the -Tascii part; and:
"Can you work this into man_html.c, too?"

@Test handling of roff conditional instructions;

1.1
log
@Add the first batch of mandoc(1) regression tests, testing for a few bugs
fixed in 1.9.9 and some older, rather subtle issues in list displays.

Directory layout and naming scheme was chosen such that later inclusion
of tests for -man and -Thtml will not force us to rename everything,
even though the layout might still seem a bit sparse right now.
More tests will slowly be added while investigating and fixing issues.
