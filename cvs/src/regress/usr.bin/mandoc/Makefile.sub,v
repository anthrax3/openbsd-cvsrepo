log
@Infrastructure for -T markdown tests.

This is needed because -T marksdown is expected to receive less
maintenance than -T ascii, so we need automation to make sure
that regular parser maintenance doesn't break this output mode.

log
@Infrastructure for testing HTML output;
this is relevant because we use the HTML output module
for man.cgi(8), where broken output can cause security issues.

log
@Infrastructure for regression tests of mandoc messages.
Even though messages are not going to be as stable as formatted output,
that is, even though the *.out_lint files are expected to change now and then,
from now on, i want to be able to catch unintended changes in messages.
