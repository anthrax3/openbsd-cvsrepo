DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     This is a sentence.  There is a double space before the next one.

     Here is a full stop (quite lonely).  It causes a double space, too.

     A dot in parantheses (.) is not a full stop.  Not even (Like in this
     case.) when preceded by a letter.

     A lonely dot in an enclosure (.) is not a full stop.

     A dot in the middle of an input line . is not a full stop.

     At the end of an input line, even an escaped dot .  is regarded as a full
     stop.
