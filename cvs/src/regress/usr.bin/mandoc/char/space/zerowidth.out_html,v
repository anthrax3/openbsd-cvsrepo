log
@Fix -man -Thtml formatting after .nf (which has nothing to do
with "literal", by the way, it means "no fill"):

* Use <pre> such that whitespace is preserved.
* Preserve lines breaks.
* For font alternating macros, avoid node recursion which required
scary juggling with the fill state.  Instead, simply print the text
children directly.

Missing feature first noticed by kristaps@@ in 2011,
the again reported by afresh1@@ in 2016,
and finally reported here: https://github.com/Debian/debiman/issues/21 ,
which i only found because of Shane Kerr's comment here:
