@Implement end-of-sentence spacing at the end of man(7) macro lines.

Improves cvs(1) pcap-filter(3) readline(3) termcap(5) cvsbug(8)
mkhybrid(8) nsd-zonec(8) in multiple places and c++filt(1) com_err(3)
nsd_conf(5) term(5) nsdc(8) in one place each.

.SH NAME
SPACE-EOS-MAN \- end-of-sentence spacing in man(7) documents
.SH DESCRIPTION
This is a sentence.
There is a double space before the next one.
.PP
Here is a full stop
.B at the end of a macro.
It causes a double space, too.
.PP
She said: "Here is another sentence."
And it was detected even with quotation marks.
(Really.)
And within parantheses.
.PP
A dot in parantheses (.) is not a full stop.
.PP
A dot in the middle of an input line . is not a full stop.
.PP
At the end of an input line, even an escaped dot \&.
is regarded as a full stop.
