       SPACE-EOS-MAN - end-of-sentence spacing in man(7) documents

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       This is a sentence.  There is a double space before the next one.

       Here is a full stop aatt tthhee eenndd ooff aa mmaaccrroo..  It causes a double space,
       too.

       She said: "Here is another sentence."  And it was detected even with
       quotation marks.  (Really.)  And within parantheses.

       A dot in parantheses (.) is not a full stop.

       A dot in the middle of an input line . is not a full stop.

       At the end of an input line, even an escaped dot .  is regarded as a
       full stop.
