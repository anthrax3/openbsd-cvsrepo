@Messages of the -Wbase level now print STYLE:.  Since this
causes horrible churn anyway, profit of the opportunity to stop
excessive testing, such that this is hopefully the last instance
of such churn.  Consistently use OpenBSD RCS tags, blank .Os,
blank fourth .TH argument, and Mdocdate like everywhere else.
Use -Ios=OpenBSD for platform-independent predictable output.

log
@Improve handling of the roff(7) "\t" escape sequence:
* Parsing macro arguments has to be done in copy mode,
  which implies replacing "\t" by a literal tab character.
* Otherwise, render "\t" as the empty string, not as a 't' character.

This fixes formatting of the distfile example in the oldrdist(1) manual.
This also shows up in the unzip(1) manual as one of several issues
preventing the removal of USE_GROFF from the archivers/unzip port.
Thanks to espie@@ for attracting my attention to the unzip(1) manual.
