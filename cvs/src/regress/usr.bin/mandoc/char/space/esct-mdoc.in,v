log
@Improve handling of the roff(7) "\t" escape sequence:
* Parsing macro arguments has to be done in copy mode,
  which implies replacing "\t" by a literal tab character.
* Otherwise, render "\t" as the empty string, not as a 't' character.

This fixes formatting of the distfile example in the oldrdist(1) manual.
This also shows up in the unzip(1) manual as one of several issues
preventing the removal of USE_GROFF from the archivers/unzip port.
Thanks to espie@@ for attracting my attention to the unzip(1) manual.
