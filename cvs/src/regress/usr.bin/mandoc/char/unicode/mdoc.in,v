log
@Messages of the -Wbase level now print STYLE:.  Since this
causes horrible churn anyway, profit of the opportunity to stop
excessive testing, such that this is hopefully the last instance
of such churn.  Consistently use OpenBSD RCS tags, blank .Os,
blank fourth .TH argument, and Mdocdate like everywhere else.
Use -Ios=OpenBSD for platform-independent predictable output.

log
@Stricter syntax checking of Unicode character names:
Require exactly 4, 5 or 6 hex digits and allow nothing else.
This avoids mishandling stuff like \[ua] and \C'uA' as Unicode
and also fixes underlining in eqn(7) -Thtml output which uses \[ul].
Problem found and semantics suggested by kristaps@@.

1.2
log
@Support the alternative syntax \C'uXXXX' for Unicode characters.
It is already documented in the Heirloom troff manual,
and groff handles it as well.

Bug reported by Bjarni Ingi Gislason <bjarniig at rhi dot hi dot is>
on <bug-groff at gnu dot org>.  Well, admittedly, that bug was reported
against groff, but mandoc was even more broken than groff with respect
to this syntax...
