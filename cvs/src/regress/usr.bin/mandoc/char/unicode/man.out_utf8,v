@Stricter syntax checking of Unicode character names:
Require exactly 4, 5 or 6 hex digits and allow nothing else.
This avoids mishandling stuff like \[ua] and \C'uA' as Unicode
and also fixes underlining in eqn(7) -Thtml output which uses \[ul].
Problem found and semantics suggested by kristaps@@.

@Support the alternative syntax \C'uXXXX' for Unicode characters.
It is already documented in the Heirloom troff manual,
and groff handles it as well.

Bug reported by Bjarni Ingi Gislason <bjarniig at rhi dot hi dot is>
on <bug-groff at gnu dot org>.  Well, admittedly, that bug was reported
against groff, but mandoc was even more broken than groff with respect
to this syntax...
