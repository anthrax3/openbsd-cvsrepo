@Now that markdown output is tested for almost everything, test all
input files in -T markdown output mode by default and only mark
those files with SKIP_MARKDOWN that are not to be tested.
Much easier to read, and almost minus 40 lines of Makefile code.

@Make the mandoc test suite completely silent.
Not even i looked at the 966 mandoc command lines
and the 787 diff command lines it was spewing,
and it was almost unusable without REGRESS_FAIL_EARLY
because any errors got lost among all the noise.

If you want to debug the Makefiles, use "make -dl".
If you want to see the -Tman TODOs, use "grep -RF SKIP_TMAN".
