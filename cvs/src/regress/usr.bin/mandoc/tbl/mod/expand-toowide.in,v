log
@Messages of the -Wbase level now print STYLE:.  Since this
causes horrible churn anyway, profit of the opportunity to stop
excessive testing, such that this is hopefully the last instance
of such churn.  Consistently use OpenBSD RCS tags, blank .Os,
blank fourth .TH argument, and Mdocdate like everywhere else.
Use -Ios=OpenBSD for platform-independent predictable output.

1.1
log
@When trying to expand some columns in a table where the sum of the
widths of the remaining columns is already wider than the line
length, underflowing size_t and dying from ENOMEM is the wrong plan.
Instead, simply refrain from expanding anything in such a situation,
avoiding a crash that tb@@ found with afl.
