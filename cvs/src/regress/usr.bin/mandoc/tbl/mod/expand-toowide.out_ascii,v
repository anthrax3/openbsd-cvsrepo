@When trying to expand some columns in a table where the sum of the
widths of the remaining columns is already wider than the line
length, underflowing size_t and dying from ENOMEM is the wrong plan.
Instead, simply refrain from expanding anything in such a situation,
avoiding a crash that tb@@ found with afl.
