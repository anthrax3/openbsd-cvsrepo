log
@For now, it can't be helped that mandoc tbl(7) ignores high-level macros,
but stop throwing away their arguments.  This fixes information loss in a
handful of Xenocara manuals, at the price of a small amount of formatting
noise creeping through.

1.2
log
@Split the -Werror message level into -Werror (broken manual, probably
using mandoc is better than using groff) and -Wunsupp (manual using
unsupported low-level roff(7) feature, probably using groff is better
than using mandoc).  Once this feature is complete, it is intended
to help porting, making the decision whether to USE_GROFF easier.

As a first step, distinguish four classes of roff(7) requests:
1. Supported (currently 24 requests)
2. Currently ignored because unimportant (120)  ->  no message
3. Ignored for good because insecure (14)  ->  -Werror
4. Currently unsupported (68)  ->  these trigger the new -Wunsupp messages

log
@Ignore mdoc(7) and man(7) macros inside tbl(7) code because they
would abort the table in an unclean way, causing assertion failures
