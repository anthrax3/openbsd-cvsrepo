@mandoc: nested.in:12:4: UNSUPP: ignoring macro in table: TS

@Split the -Werror message level into -Werror (broken manual, probably
using mandoc is better than using groff) and -Wunsupp (manual using
unsupported low-level roff(7) feature, probably using groff is better
than using mandoc).  Once this feature is complete, it is intended
to help porting, making the decision whether to USE_GROFF easier.

As a first step, distinguish four classes of roff(7) requests:
1. Supported (currently 24 requests)
2. Currently ignored because unimportant (120)  ->  no message
3. Ignored for good because insecure (14)  ->  -Werror
4. Currently unsupported (68)  ->  these trigger the new -Wunsupp messages

@Ignore mdoc(7) and man(7) macros inside tbl(7) code because they
would abort the table in an unclean way, causing assertion failures
