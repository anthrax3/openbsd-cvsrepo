log
@Remove support for COMPILER_VERSION == gcc2.
Change the logic depending upon COMPILER_VERSION everywhere, to assume gcc4
is the norm and to explicitely test for gcc3 when a different behaviour
is required.
No functional change intended. Be sure to `make install' in share/mk before
attempting to do anything.
