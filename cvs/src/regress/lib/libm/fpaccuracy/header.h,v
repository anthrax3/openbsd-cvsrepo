@fpaccuracy, by prof. Gaston H. Gonnet, uses some most difficult
values to test accuracy of math functions (currently, only double
precision tests are present)

/* C program to test the accuracy of a given function.
   This will be done in terms of ulps.  A ulp is a "unit in
   the last place".  No program can guarantee results better
   than 0.5 ulp.  As a matter of fact, 0.5 ulp could require
   infinite computation.  So very good implementations
   usually achieve 0.51 ulp.  0.6 ulp is still very good, 1 ulp
   starts to get a bit sloppy.

   The model of computation is the standard one, the result of f(x)
   is the correctly rounded value of f(x) when x is assumed to be
   an exact rational.

   This program selects values which are difficult to compute to
   measure the quality of the computation.

   Hardware which has floating point registers with extra bits of
   precision (e.g. Pentium) usually do much better than others.
   This function computes the accuracy for both cases.   */

/* We represent double precision floating point numbers x as a
   pair of an integer and a base 2 exponent.  x = mant*2^expo,
   or x = scalb(mant,expo).  2^52 <= mant < 2^53.  This is to
   avoid sloppy compilers which do not transcribe correctly
   some input doubles */

/* scalb( F(arg[i]), val_e[i] ) == val[i]+eps[i]
	to about twice precision.
	The scaling is done so that val[i] is in ulps
	(val is consequently an integer)
	and to avoid underflows in certain cases. */

/* Shell sort, needs the definition of KEY(x)

   Can sort any array r from r[lo] to r[hi] in place.
   Uses a temporary variable t, of the same type as r[].
   The comparison is done between KEY(r[i]) vs KEY(r[j]),
