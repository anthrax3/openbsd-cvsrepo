1.2
log
@These tests didn't work without setting READLINE because we don't
install <editline/readline.h> by default; make them work by using
the copy from the source tree.
Issue reported by otto@@.

1.1
log
@A few regression tests for libedit readline(3) compat code.
Not linked to the build for now because these tests still fail for
our libedit and because readline compat is not enabled in our build.

Test suite written by Bastian Maerkisch <bmaerkisch@@web.de>.
KNF and some minor tweaks by me.
