1.1
log
@add minimal server capability to aucat(1). When started in server
mode, it listens on an unix socket and mixes/demultiplexes any number
of full-duplex streams, doing necessary format conversions and
resampling on the fly.

programs can use the new libsa(3) library to play and record audio.
The library provides a very simple API to connect to the audio server;
if aucat(1) isn't running, it uses the audio(4) driver transparently
instead.
