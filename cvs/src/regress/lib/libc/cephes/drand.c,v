/*							drand.c
 *
 *	Pseudorandom number generator
 *
 *
 *
 * SYNOPSIS:
 *
 * double y, drand();
 *
 * drand( &y );
 *
 *
 *
 * DESCRIPTION:
 *
 * Yields a random number 1.0 <= y < 2.0.
 *
 * The three-generator congruential algorithm by Brian
 * Wichmann and David Hill (BYTE magazine, March, 1987,
 * pp 127-8) is used. The period, given by them, is
 * 6953607871644.
 *
 * Versions invoked by the different arithmetic compile
 * time options DEC, IBMPC, and MIEEE, produce
 * approximately the same sequences, differing only in the
 * least significant bits of the numbers. The UNK option
 * implements the algorithm as recommended in the BYTE
 * article.  It may be used on all computers. However,
 * the low order bits of a double precision number may
 * not be adequately random, and may vary due to arithmetic
 * implementation details on different computers.
 *
 * The other compile options generate an additional random
 * integer that overwrites the low order bits of the double
 * precision number.  This reduces the period by a factor of
 * two but tends to overcome the problems mentioned.
 *
