.Sh NAME
.Nm audiotest_rw
.Nd test read and write calls using audio
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm audiotest_rw
.Bk -words
.Op Fl dnpsv
.Op Fl b Ar buffersize
.Op Fl c Ar channels
.Op Fl e Ar encoding
.Op Fl f Ar device
.Op Fl i Ar input
.Op Fl l Ar loops
.Op Fl o Ar output
.Op Fl r Ar samplerate
.Ek
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command reads data from and writes data to
.Xr audio 4
device
.Ar device .
The default
.Ar device
is
.Pa /dev/audio .
If the
.Fl i
option is used
.Ar device
will be opened write-only and
.Nm
will
.Xr fread 3
data from
.Ar input
and
.Xr write 2
it to
.Ar device .
If the
.Fl o
option is used
.Ar device
will be opened read-only and
.Nm
will
.Xr read 2
data from
.Ar device
and
.Xr fwrite 3
it to
.Ar output .
If both
.Fl i
and
.Fl o
are specified and
.Ar device
supports full-duplex operation,
.Ar device
will be opened read-write and
.Nm
will both
.Xr fread 3
data from
.Ar input
and
.Xr write 2
it to
.Ar device
and
.Xr read 2
data from
.Ar device
and
.Xr fwrite 3
it to
.Ar output .
If neither
.Fl i
nor
.Fl o
are used
.Nm
will exit with an error.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl b Ar buffersize
Buffer size for
.Xr read 2
and
.Xr write 2
operations, in bytes.
Valid arguments are 32 to 65536 inclusive.
It defaults to 8192.
.It Fl c Ar channels
Number of audio channels.
Valid arguments are 1 (mono) and 2 (stereo).
It defaults to 2.
.It Fl d
Opens
.Ar device
read-write and sets full-duplex mode, regardless of
.Fl i
and
.Fl o
options.
If
.Ar device
does not support full-duplex operation,
.Nm
will exit with an error.
.It Fl e Ar encoding
The audio encoding to use.
.Ar encoding
is the index of the encoding to use in the list of encodings supported by
.Ar device ,
starting at 0.
It defaults to 0.
The list of upported encodings can be viewed with
.Xr audioctl 1 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ audioctl encodings
.Ed
.It Fl f Ar device
The
.Xr audio 4
device to use.
It defaults to
.Pa /dev/audio .
.It Fl i Ar input
The file from which raw (headerless) audio data will be read.
.It Fl l Ar loops
The number of times to read and/or write.
It defaults to 64.
.It Fl n
Use information about the play and record buffers as reported by the
.Dv AUDIO_GETPRINFO
and
.Dv AUDIO_GETRRINFO
ioctls to wait until data may be read without blocking on each
.Xr read 2
and to wait until data may be written without blocking on each
.Xr write 2 .
.It Fl o Ar output
The file to which raw (headerless) audio data will be written.
.It Fl p
Use
.Xr poll 2
to wait until data may be read without blocking on each
.Xr read 2
and to wait until data may be written without blocking on each
.Xr write 2 .
Using this option also causes
.Ar device
to be opened for non-blocking I/O.
.It Fl r Ar samplerate
The audio data sample rate in samples per second.
It defaults to 48000.
.It Fl s
Use
.Xr select 2
to wait until data may be read without blocking on each
.Xr read 2
and to wait until data may be written without blocking on each
.Xr write 2 .
Using this option also causes
.Ar device
to be opened for non-blocking I/O.
.It Fl v
Verbose mode.
.El
.Pp
.Nm
was written as a strict interpretation of
.Xr audio 4 .
Problems encountered while using
.Nm
are likely due to errors in
.Xr audio 4
documentation, the kernel's audio layer implementation, or audio
device drivers.
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following command will open /dev/audio read-only, set /dev/audio
to record mode with default parameters (channels:2
encoding:0 sample rate 48000), and read data from /dev/audio and
write it to the file test.pcm:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ audiotest_rw -o test.pcm
.Ed
.Pp
The following command will open /dev/audio write-only, set /dev/audio
to play mode with default parameters (channels:2
encoding:0 sample rate 48000), and read data from the file test.pcm
and write it to /dev/audio:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ audiotest_rw -i test.pcm
.Ed
.Pp
The following command will open /dev/audio read-write, set /dev/audio
to full-duplex mode with default parameters (channels:2
encoding:0 sample rate 48000), read data from the file test.pcm
and write it to /dev/audio, and read data from /dev/audio and
write it to the file test2.pcm:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ audiotest_rw -i test.pcm -o test2.pcm
.Ed
.Pp
The following command will open /dev/audio read-only with non-blocking
I/O, set /dev/audio to record mode with default parameters (channels:2
encoding:0 sample rate 48000), and read data from /dev/audio and
write it to the file test.pcm, using poll() to determine when data
is ready to be read:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ audiotest_rw -o test.pcm -p
.Ed
.Pp
The following command will open /dev/audio read-write with non-blocking
I/o, set /dev/audio to full-duplex mode with default parameters (channels:2
encoding:0 sample rate 48000), read data from the file test.pcm
and write it to /dev/audio, and read data from /dev/audio and
write it to the file test2.pcm, using select() to determine when data
is ready for reading and/or writing on /dev/audio:

add two new audio ioctls, AUDIO_GETPRINFO and AUDIO_GETRRINFO, and the
data structure these ioctls use, audio_bufinfo.

these ioctls return information about the play and record buffers
into the audio_bufinfo structure.

these are being added to aid in porting non-native audio applications
and libraries, and to fix issues in our OSS audio emulation.  these
ioctls exist only on OpenBSD and should not be used in code intended
for distribution.
