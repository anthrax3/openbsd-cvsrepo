1.1.1.1
log
@Add a regression test suite for the pf divert-to and divert-reply
feature.  It requires two machines, the local host is running the
regression test, the remote host gets pf divert rules installed.
The diverted TCP connections are running between these hosts in
both directions.  The remote host is controlled via ssh.
