@a combined non-exec test set.
allows reusing same testing code for:
- text & mprotect (not finished, not enabled);
- data, data & mprotect;
- bss, bss & mprotect;
- heap, heap & mprotect;
- stack, stack & mprotect.
also a test for mmaping pages in those areas
and see how it allows execution (suggested by art@@),
not enabled yet.
all tested on i386 and hppa.
