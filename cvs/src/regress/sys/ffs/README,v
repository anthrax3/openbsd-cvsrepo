@Run the existing tests for FFS also on a NFS mount point.
@
text
@$OpenBSD: README,v 1.2 2011/04/18 16:52:11 thib Exp $

These tests must be run as root, on a system with free vnd0 and vnd1 slots.
It is also advised that /mnt be unmounted, and clean.
The NFS tests create an entry in /etc/exports and start NFS server
daemons for a loopback mount.

1.2
log
@Deprecate vnds in favour of svnds.

In effect, this removes the "old" vndX nodes, and renames
the svndX nodes to vndX.

Old svndX nodes will still continue to work though, for now.

Cleanup accordingly.
