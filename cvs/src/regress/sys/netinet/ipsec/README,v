@Run tcpdump(8) on the enc0 device while the test is sending IPsec
packets.  Then check whether decrypted packets have been processed
by bpf(4) as expected.

@Send IPsec traffic to another machine where it gets processed.
There the IPsec implementation has to deliver it to the local stack
or forward it after decryption.  By reflecting the packets, the way
back is also tested.  When the response is received at the generating
machine, the test is considered successful.

Currently ICMP ping, UDP and TCP packets are protected with ESP and AH.
Transport and tunnel mode are tested with all combinations of IPv4
and IPv6.

The BPF output of the enc0 interface is checked.

TODO:
BPF output of pflog0 should be checked.
Tests for fragments and path MTU discovery are planned.
Test TCP MD5 signatures.
