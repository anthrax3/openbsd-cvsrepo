@Test IPsec with AH the same way it is already done for ESP.

@Send IPsec traffic to another machine where it gets processed.
There the IPsec implementation has to deliver it to the local stack
or forward it after decryption.  By reflecting the packets, the way
back is also tested.  When the response is received at the generating
machine, the test is considered successful.

Currently ICMP ping, UDP and TCP packets are protected with ESP and AH.
Transport and tunnel mode are tested with all combinations of IPv4
and IPv6.

TODO:
Tests for IPCOMP/IPIP and path MTU discovery are planned.
BPF output of enc0 and pflog0 should be checked.

@Test combinations of IPsec tunnel and transport mode on several
machines.  For now only ESP encrypted IPv4 and IPv6 ICMP ping packets
are generated.
