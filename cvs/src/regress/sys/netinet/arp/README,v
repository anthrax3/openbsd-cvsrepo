@Regression tests for the ARP implementation in the kernel.

The test suite runs on the machine LOCAL, the kernel under test is
running on REMOTE.  On LOCAL Scapy is generating ARP packes and
sends them to REMOTE.  The replies to LOCAL are analyzed.  The
kernel log files are fetched from REMOTE via SCP and grepped for
messages.  The ARP table of REMOTE is inspected via SSH login.

Interfaces and adresses on REMOTE and LOCAL must be preconfigured.
The test manually adds entries into the REMOTE ARP table and tries
to overwrite them with fake ARP packets.  Some addresses are on the
REMOTE interface facing LOCAL other are on a second interface.  The
ARP input code has different cases for that.  So all possible log
messages from ARP input can be triggered by a subtest.

Additionally check that REMOTE can answer a Proxy ARP Requests.

EXAMPLE

To run this test I use the following configuration files.
You should choose a different set of MAC and IP addresses.

- My local machine where I run the regression test:

/etc/hosts
# to login to qemu with SSH via IPv6 link-local
fe80::725f:caff:fe21:8d70%tap0		q70

/etc/hostname.tap0
lladdr fe:e1:ba:d0:d5:6d up
inet 10.188.70.17 255.255.255.0
inet6 eui64

/etc/hostname.tap1
up

- My qemu where the kernel under test is running

/etc/hostname.vio0 
lladdr 70:5f:ca:21:8d:70
inet 10.188.70.70 255.255.255.0
inet6 eui64

/etc/hostname.vio1
inet 10.188.211.70 255.255.255.0

- My environment when executing the test

LOCAL_IF=tap0
LOCAL_MAC=fe:e1:ba:d0:d5:6d
REMOTE_MAC=70:5f:ca:21:8d:70
FAKE_MAC=12:34:56:78:9a:bc
PROXY_MAC=00:90:27:bb:cc:dd
REMOTE_SSH=q70

LOCAL_ADDR=10.188.70.17
REMOTE_ADDR=10.188.70.70
FAKE_ADDR=10.188.70.188
OTHER_ADDR=10.188.211.70
OTHERFAKE_ADDR=10.188.211.188

export LOCAL_IF LOCAL_MAC REMOTE_MAC FAKE_MAC REMOTE_SSH LOCAL_ADDR REMOTE_ADDR
export FAKE_ADDR OTHER_ADDR OTHERFAKE_ADDR

@Add my machines' configuration files as an example to the readme.
That should make it easier for others to set up the test.

log
@Add regression tests for the ARP implementation in the kernel.  Send
multiple ARP packets to a remote machine with Scapy.  Check ARP 
replies, table entries and log messages.  All log messages in 
in_arpinput() are generated.  Proxy ARP is also tested.
