log
@Enter a static ARP entry for a fake address which is not published
by the ARP proxy.  The kernel must not answer ARP requests for such
addresss.  This test triggers a misbehavior in ART as it currently
answers in such situations.  Radix tree works fine as it uses 33
bit IPv4 entries for ARP proxy.
