1.1
log
@new test, modeled after some old kde update.
When a file moves between packages, one new package will conflict with
two old packages, in which case pkg_add should update both (and it does not,
not yet).

We distinguish from the case where a new package is an update for two packages
by the absence of a @@pkgpath annotation.
