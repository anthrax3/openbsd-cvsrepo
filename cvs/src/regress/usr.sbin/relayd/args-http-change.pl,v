@To make sure that at least anything is tested, add a length check
per default for the default length value in check_logs().  If a
test doesn't want this check, it has to disable it explicitly with
nocheck.  Also remove unneeded nocheck switches for deeper testing.

@Update and extend the regress tests to use the new grammar of the
filtering rules.  Some of the filenames are based on the old grammar,
we keep them for now and just update the contents to have a
before/after comparison of the features.

Most of the work was done by Andre de Oliveira (andre@@)
