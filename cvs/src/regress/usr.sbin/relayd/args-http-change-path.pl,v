@Simplify the code that handles the HTTP headers by using an RB tree
with associated lists instead of the complicated lookup table and
"others" list.  This might add a little malloc overhead for common
headers but also fixes some issues like the handling of repeated
headers -  for example, handling of multiple "Set-Cookie" headers.

@To make sure that at least anything is tested, add a length check
per default for the default length value in check_logs().  If a
test doesn't want this check, it has to disable it explicitly with
nocheck.  Also remove unneeded nocheck switches for deeper testing.

@Update and extend the regress tests to use the new grammar of the
filtering rules.  Some of the filenames are based on the old grammar,
we keep them for now and just update the contents to have a
before/after comparison of the features.

Most of the work was done by Andre de Oliveira (andre@@)

@Fix the relayd regression tests.  Now they pass with and without

@Refactors "dummyrun" flag as "dryrun" with an approach similar to the one used
for client/server processes checks through $self->{down} state control
variable, while here, do not instantiate a client when noclient is defined,
reflecting server object instantiation behaviour.
