log
@Do not mix Perl read() with sysread().  Data could get stuck in the
buffered IO and test run-regress-args-http-chunked.pl would fail
on slow hardware.  Limit debug output to one line per 1% of data.
Improve function write_syswrite().  Sync with httpd regress.  Fix
whitespace.

log
@Add test cases for a crash reported by Bertrand PROVOST.  When a
HTTP client writes multiple requests or chunks in a single transfer,
relayd invokes the libevent callback manually for the next data.
If the callback closes the session, this results in an use after
free.
Test an invalid second request method, test an invalid header line
in the second PUT request, test an invalid second chunked length
for a PUT request.  Also test multiple valid HTTP 1.1 PUT requests
with chunked body.
To detect crashes of relayd, start it with "prefork 1" and grep for
"lost child" log messages.  Unfortunately only the first child is
monitored by the parent.

@Put a license file into the test directories with multiple argument
files.  We do not want to put a license header into each subtest.
