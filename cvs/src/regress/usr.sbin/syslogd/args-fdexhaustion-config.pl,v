1.4
log
@Test logging to console by redirecting the system's console into a
file.  All subtests get an additional /dev/console entry in
syslog.conf, then check that messages appear in the console file.
Add a test that stops syslogd, calls sendsyslog2() with LOG_CONS
and checks that the message appears in the console file.
@
text
@# The syslogd is started with reduced file descriptor limits.
# The syslogd config contains more log files than possible.
# The client writes a message to Sys::Syslog native method.
# The syslogd writes it into a file and through a pipe.
# The syslogd passes it via UDP to the loghost.
# The server receives the message on its UDP socket.
# Find the message in client, file, pipe, syslogd, server log.
# Check the error messages and multiple log file content.

@Allow to use $curdir, $objdir, $host, $hostname in the test config
file.  They are substituted automatically, to avoid this in each
