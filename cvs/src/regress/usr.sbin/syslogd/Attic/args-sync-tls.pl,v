@# The client writes 300 long messages to UDP socket.
# The syslogd writes it into a file and through a pipe.
# The syslogd does a TLS reconnect and passes it to loghost.
# The server blocks the message on its TLS socket.
# The server waits until the client has written all messages.
# The server closes the TLS connection and accepts a new one.
# The server receives the messages on its new accepted TLS socket.
# This way the server receives a block of messages that is truncated
# at the beginning and at the end.
# Find the message in client, file, pipe, syslogd, server log.
# Check that the server does not get lines that are cut in the middle.

@Do not count the dropped messages strictly, so that the syslogd
tests are depending less on the timing.  Fix a race in the buffer
sync test.  Now make regress of syslogd passes on my amd64, i386,
sparc64, alpha machines.

@Make syslogd test more reliable.  Use Time::HiRes to sleep .01
seconds in the write_lines() loop.  This slows down the client, so
all messages reach syslogd and flood its buffers.  Increase the
timeout to wait until all buffers are full.  Use this code in all
TCP/TLS buffer and memory overflow tests.
