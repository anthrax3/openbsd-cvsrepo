log
@Test syslogd logging to a tty which belongs to a user.  This is
done with a utmp entry for a pty fake login.  All messages are read
from the pty and written into a log file.

@# The syslogd listens on 127.0.0.1 TLS socket.
# The client connects and closes the connection to syslogd.
# The syslogd writes the error into a file and through a pipe.
# Find the message in file, syslogd log.
# Check that syslogd writes a log message about the client close.
