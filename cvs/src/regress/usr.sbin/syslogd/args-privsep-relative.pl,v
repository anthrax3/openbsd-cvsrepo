@# Start syslogd with relative path.
# The client writes a message to Sys::Syslog native method.
# The syslogd writes it into a file and through a pipe.
# The syslogd passes it via UDP to the loghost.
# The server receives the message on its UDP socket.
# Find the message in client, file, console, user, syslogd, server log.
# Check fstat for root and working directory.
# Check ktrace for chroot, chdir, exec.
