log
@Test logging to console by redirecting the system's console into a
file.  All subtests get an additional /dev/console entry in
syslog.conf, then check that messages appear in the console file.
Add a test that stops syslogd, calls sendsyslog2() with LOG_CONS
and checks that the message appears in the console file.

@Add args-bufsize-native.pl that checks wether libc syslog(3) can
handle 8192 bytes messages.  Rename the sendsyslog(2) tests
consistently.
