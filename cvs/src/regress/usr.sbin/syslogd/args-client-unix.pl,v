log
@Test syslogd logging to a tty which belongs to a user.  This is
done with a utmp entry for a pty fake login.  All messages are read
from the pty and written into a log file.

@# The client writes a message to Sys::Syslog unix method.
# The syslogd writes it into a file and through a pipe.
# The syslogd passes it via UDP to the loghost.
# The server receives the message on its UDP socket.
# Find the message in client, file, pipe, syslogd, server log.
# Check that the file log contains the hostname and message.
