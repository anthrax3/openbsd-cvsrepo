@To test syslogd compatibility rsyslog is used as remote server.
New rsyslog has other options and debug output, adapt test.

@# Test with rsyslogd as receiver.
# The client writes a message to Sys::Syslog native method.
# The syslogd writes it into a file and through a pipe.
# The syslogd passes it via UDP to the rsyslogd.
# The rsyslogd receives the message on its UDP socket.
# Find the message in client, file, pipe, syslogd, rsyslogd log.
# Check that the message is in the rsyslogd out file.

log
@Add regression tests where OpenBSD syslogd is sending messages to
rsyslogd from ports.  If the rsyslog package is installed, rsyslogd
is used as drain to test interoperability.  This will be especially
useful for syslog via TCP and TLS.
