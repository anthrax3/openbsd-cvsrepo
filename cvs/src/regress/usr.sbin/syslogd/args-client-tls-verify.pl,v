@Test syslogd TLS client certificate validation.

text
@# The syslogd listens on 127.0.0.1 TLS socket with self-signed certificate.
# The client validates cert and writes message into a 127.0.0.1 TLS socket.
# The syslogd writes it into a file and through a pipe.
# The syslogd passes it via UDP to the loghost.
# The server receives the message on its UDP socket.
# Find the message in client, file, pipe, syslogd, server log.
# Check that the client file log contains the syslogd certifcate.
