@The TCP socket buffer size for syslogd has changed.  Adapt tests
where we count the dropped messages.  A different number gets stuck
in the kernel buffers now which is not included in the syslogd
statistics.

@# The client writes 400 messages to Sys::Syslog native method.
# The syslogd writes it into a file and through a pipe.
# The syslogd passes it via TCP to the loghost.
# The server blocks the message on its TCP socket.
# The server waits until the client has written all messages.
# The server receives the message on its TCP socket.
# The client waits until the server as read the first message.
# Find the message in client, file, pipe, syslogd, server log.

1.3
log
@Make syslogd test more reliable.  Use Time::HiRes to sleep .01
seconds in the write_lines() loop.  This slows down the client, so
all messages reach syslogd and flood its buffers.  Increase the
timeout to wait until all buffers are full.  Use this code in all
TCP/TLS buffer and memory overflow tests.
