1.3
log
@Make syslogd test more reliable.  Use Time::HiRes to sleep .01
seconds in the write_lines() loop.  This slows down the client, so
all messages reach syslogd and flood its buffers.  Increase the
timeout to wait until all buffers are full.  Use this code in all
TCP/TLS buffer and memory overflow tests.
@
text
@# The client writes message to overflow the memory buffer method.
# The syslogd writes it into a file and through a pipe.
# The syslogd passes it via UDP to the loghost.
# The server receives the message on its UDP socket.
# Syslogc checks the memory logs.
# Check that memory buffer has overflow flag.
