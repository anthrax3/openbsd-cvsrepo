@Syslogd does no longer keep the *:514 UDP sockets open by default.
Adapt tests.

@# The client writes messages to localhost IPv4 and IPv6 UDP socket.
# The syslogd does not receive them as it is started without -u.
# Keep the sockets open by pretending to write to them.
# Check that client does send the message, but it is not in the file.
# Check with fstat that both *:514 sockets are bound.
# Check that there is no recvfrom localhost in syslogd ktrace.
