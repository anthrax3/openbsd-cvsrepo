@Check that non existing log files in syslog.conf are reported to
/dev/console during startup and restart.  Startup warnings contain
the pid now.  Console logging creates additional errors if the file
descriptor limit is exhausted.

@# The syslogd has a non existing log file in its config.
# The client writes a message to Sys::Syslog native method.
# The syslogd writes it into a file and through a pipe and to tty.
# The syslogd passes it via UDP to the loghost.
# The server receives the message on its UDP socket.
# Find the message in client, file, pipe, console, user, syslogd, server log.
