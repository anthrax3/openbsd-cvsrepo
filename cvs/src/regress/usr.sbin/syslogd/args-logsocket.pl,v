log
@New tests for +host in syslog.conf that matches on an IPv4 and IPv6
address.  Add test for syslogd -p log_socket.

text
@# The client writes a messages to /dev/log and an alternative log socket.
# The syslogd listens on /var/run/log but not on /dev/log.
# The syslogd writes it into a file and through a pipe.
# The syslogd passes it via UDP to the loghost.
# The server receives the message on its UDP socket.
# Find the message in client, file, pipe, syslogd, server log.
# Check that only the meassge to the alternative log socket is logged.
