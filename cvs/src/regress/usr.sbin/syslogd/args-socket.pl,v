@Rework how fstat and ktrace pattern are specified in the test
arguments.  Add tests to check wether syslogd privsep works.  This
is done for debug and foreground and daemon mode.  Fstat is checked
for chroot and sockets.  Ktrace dump is grepped for setting uid and
gid.

@# Test with default values, that is:
# The client writes a message to a localhost IPv4 UDP socket.
# The syslogd writes it into a file and through a pipe.
# The syslogd passes it via UDP to the loghost.
# The server receives the message on its UDP socket.
# Find the message in client, file, pipe, syslogd, server log.
# Check that the syslogd has one IPv4 socket in fstat output.

1.1.1.1
log
@Run syslogd regressions tests.  As only one syslogd can run per
machine, each test kills any syslogd first.  At the end the system's
syslogd gets restarted.
The test framework runs a client, and a server, and a syslogd.  The
messages are passed via the log socket or via UDP from the client
to syslogd.  From there UDP transport is used to reach the server.
All processes write log files where the message has to show up.
The test arguments are kept in the args-*.pl files.
The content of a log file, the data sent to a pipe process and what
the server received are checked.  The invocation of the sendsyslog(2)
syscall is checked with ktrace, the open file descriptors of syslogd
are checked with fstat.
