1.2
log
@Do not mix Perl read() with sysread().  Data could get stuck in the
buffered IO and test run-regress-args-get-1073741824.pl would fail
on slow hardware.  Introduce a common function read_part() that
uses Perl read().  Limit debug output to one line per 1% of data.
Remove unused function http_server().  Fix whitespace.  Cleanup
Makefile.
