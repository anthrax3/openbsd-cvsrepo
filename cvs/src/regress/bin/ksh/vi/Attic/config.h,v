log
@Rewrite ksh edit mode regression tests.

Instead of calling x_vi() directly, run ksh in a pseudo tty.
This makes the process of adding tests for emacs mode simpler since the code can
be shared.

1.1
log
@The ksh(1) vi editing mode code is much harder to understand than
the emacs editing mode code, so add a testsuite before touching it.
To avoid having to deal with the horrendous low-level terminal
handling and high-level command execution code, write the tests in
unit test style rather than in integration test style, by providing
minimal glue to run vi.c stand-alone.  In case relevant internal
interfaces in sh.c, edit.c, and friends are changed, the glue may
need adjustment.
Not testing completion and history at this time, only line editing.
