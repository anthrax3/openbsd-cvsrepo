1.1
log
@Move ksh test files into regress.
@
text
@Tests can be assigned categories to restrict what program they
are applied to (eg, pdksh, ksh88, etc.).  The following are
a list of names to be used for various shells (to keep things
consistent):

    sh		generic		any v7 bourne shell like thing
    sh-v	generic		any system V bourne shell like thing
    ksh		generic		any ksh
    posix	generic		basic posix shell
    posix-upu	generic		`user portability utility' options
    sh-v7	specific	the real v7 bourne shell
    sh-sysv	specific	the real sysv bourne shell
    pdksh	specific	public domain ksh
    ksh88	specific	at&t ksh88
    ksh93	specific	at&t ksh93
    bash	specific	GNU bourne-again shell

The idea is to categorize all the tests according to the `best match'
(most generic thing).  All generics that apply should be specified.
Generally, at most one specific shell will be given.

At the moment, most (all) tests have not been categorized (any volunteers?).
