README.files			This list.

ported-software			A list of software ported to NetBSD/Alpha,
				and patches to make software go.

Snapshots are organized by release.  Releases are numbered by year, month,
and day, in directories with names of the form "YYMMDD".

In each directory:

README_FIRST			Important last-minute notes about the snapshot.
README				Installation notes; incomplete.
STATUS				Status of NetBSD/Alpha, supported hardware list.
TODO.users			Things that I think users could do to help out.

bin/				Directory with binaries for this snapshot.

	bin.tar.gz		Everything on the disk image except /etc,
				/usr/X11R6, /boot, and the kernel.
	etc.tar.gz		/etc from the disk image.
	netbsd.gz		Gzipped GENERIC kernel (also on disk image).
	netbsd.gdb.gz		Gzipped GENERIC kernel w/debugging symbols.
	rz25-image.gz		Disk image, of an RZ25, for installation.
	x11.tar.gz		/usr/X11R6 from the disk image.

src/				Directory with sources for this snapshot.

	X11R6-XF86-3.1.2-diffs.gz
				Diffs from XFree86 3.1.2 used to make the
				X11 binaries in the distribution.
				X11 sources should be placed in
				/usr/alphasrc/xc.
	cygnus.tar.gz		Toolchain (gcc, gas, ld, etc.) sources
				used to build the compiler toolchain.
				Should be untarred into /usr/alphasrc/cygnus.

@Did some s/NetBSD/OpenBSD/, s/netbsd/bsd/ and $OpenBSD$ additions.
However this stuff is largely related to NetBSD and must be completely
redone, if we will make real relases sometime
