@Redo serial console configuration logic. Smaller, easier to

Add serial console handling for alpha, macppc, zaurus.  No functional
change for i386/amd64.

@Cleanup and shrinkage:

1) Eliminate 'WARNING: Disk xxx has no label.' message. When installing OpenBSD
this is a normal condition not worth commenting on. From some discussion on
hackers/icb.

2) Use consistant verbiage and case statement when checking the disklabel.

3) Consistantly suppress output of 'disklabel -W', reducing duplicate messages
like '# using MBR partition ...' which are issued again when the 'disklabel -f
...' command is executed.

4) Usual code rectifications - eliminate extra {}'s, multiple echos
elimination, etc.

@Treat 'bsd' like just another filename in THESETS, no more 'kernel'
logic.  As result, MDSETS gone from everything but mac68k.

MDSETS now treated as a list of complete file names to add to THESETS,
allowing more MD flexibility, i.e. may or may not be .tgz files.

All traces of tar.gz removed. Not used for sets since 2.7 or so. As a
result of code simplification from not having to consider tar.gz, the
functions get_sets(), make_lastset(), and set_not_done() are
eliminated, along with the global SETS.

Build THESETS and DEFAULTSETS to contain full file names.

Always install sets in the order they appear in THESETS, keeping
siteXX last but without needing special logic. More predictable for
user if a lot of set additions and removals done before being
satisfied, as the sets are now installed in the same order they appear
in the selection list.

Remove ability to look for non-set .tgz/.tar.gz files. The job of the
install scripts is to install the standard sets in a simple and
rational way. Not to install general tar balls. The user can do that
post-install or simply '!' out to do it during install. On their head
be it.

If no sets are found in a specified source, list the filenames in
THESETS to show what is being looked for.

@Eliminate md_questions(). It was used only to control the setting of

from md_installboot().

Add MDXAPERTURE variable to relevant architectures.

Add a new function set_machdep_allowaperture(). It is called *after*
install_sets() (which changes when the X Window question is asked), and
if MDXAPERTURE is present modifies sysctl.conf.

Shrinks overall size for i386, macppc, sparc64 (which used md_questions
for machdep.allowaperture) but increases size a bit for other
architectures since set_machep_allowaperture is in install.sub.
