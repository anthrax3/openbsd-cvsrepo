@Retire OpenBSD/cats. Hardware is nice but prone to catch fire, and the firmware
is anything but useful. Nevertheless this was a very good platform to use as
an OpenBSD/*arm* starting point, but nowadays this platform is not necessary
anymore.

Somehow these CATS motherboard are just like AUI hubs, with the difference that,
when my AUI hub caught fire, 10base5 support was not removed from the networking
code.

**** NOTE ****

A valid MBR for an OpenBSD bootable disk must contain at least:

a) One DOS (id '06') partition at least 1MB in size. This is where OpenFirmware
will look for the 'ofwboot' program used to boot OpenBSD. Consult your PowerPC
OpenFirmware manual -and- the INSTALL.$ARCH file for directions on setting up
this partition correctly.

b) One OpenBSD (id 'A6') partition.

**************

Current partition information is:

$(fdisk $_disk)

__EOT

	fdisk -e $_disk

	cat << __EOT
Here is the MBR configuration you chose:

$(fdisk $_disk)

Please take note of the offsets and sizes of the DOS partition, the OpenBSD
partition, and any other partitions you want to access from OpenBSD. You will
need this information to fill in the OpenBSD disklabel.
