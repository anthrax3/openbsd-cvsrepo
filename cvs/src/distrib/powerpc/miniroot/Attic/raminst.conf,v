log
@Deleted files that were not used anymore, this is all of the
inst-common and miniroot files. ramdisk is all that is used.
ramdisk/install.sh and ramdisk/install.sub are actually moved from
miniroot/*.
Makefile was changed to build the ofw versions of the ramdisk kernel.
minor tweaks to leave the MAKEDEV file on the ramdisk, so that new devices
could be generated. Makefile was changed to not create temporary files
that are lost track of and cannot be "make unconfig"ed.
