@Add eject to the powerpc ramdisk, mt is already there, so it is basically
free. Allows ejecting of CDROMs on slot loading systems without an eject
button.

@pppd was removed in the previous commit, however it was not removed
cleanly, chat was left.
pppd does not make sense on systems without working serial or modem
support.

log
@First cut at HFS shared parition capable ramdisk.
Documentation needs to be enhanced to reflect how to use this
properly.
Still one major issue with kernel recognizing new disklabel after
disk is modified with pdisk.
MD label handing in the install.md still needs to be cleaned up.

@Deal with the chgrp chown -> chmod change.
instead of generating a text file from list, just create it
and edit it directly, allows for more control.
Also i386 edits this file directly instead of using awk to generate it.
