@mksuncd lives in the base now, and one does not need to go do fiddly
things in distrib before building snaps or cds of any kind, any more.

.Sh NAME
.Nm mksuncd
.Nd add a bootable ufs partition to a filesystem image
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm mksuncd
.Ar partition-letter
.Ar imagefile
.Ar ufsfile
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility adds the file
.Ar ufsfile
to the end of
.Ar imagefile .
.Ar ufsfile
is assumed to be a bootable filesystem image and
.Ar imagefile
is assumed to be something like an ISO 9660 filesystem.
A Sun-style disklabel is expected to already be present
at the beginning of
.Ar imagefile ,
and
.Nm
will update that label so that the partition (a-h) given by
.Ar partition-letter
points to
.Ar ufsfile
within
.Ar imagefile .
.Pp
Based on the label in
.Ar imagefile ,
that file is padded so that added files are always on cylinder boundaries.
This is a requirement of the PROM.
.Sh BUGS
This program is not endian or type safe.
It makes several assumptions about both based on its
SPARC bias.

1.1
log
@a little program for appending a ufs filesystem to the end of an ISO
that knows how to modify the Sun already present disklabel to point
at it.  Based partly on mksunbootcd from netbsd and some trial and
error (anyone need some coasters... I've got lots).
