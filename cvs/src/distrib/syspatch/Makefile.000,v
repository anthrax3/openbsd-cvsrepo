@add infrastructure to build syspatches (binary updates to stable)

Makefile.000 corresponds to errata_000 which is nonexistent so it
is a good place to provide an example of how to build the others

this is still work in progress, getting it in so people can join
in on the development

@# $OpenBSD$

# Set ERRATA to match the errata on the mirrors
ERRATA=	000_dummy

# Set BUILD to the type of the errata so that it can be built properly
# 	src - run make targets in the specified subdir(s) for base
# 	kernel - build both GENERIC and GENERIC.MP
# 	xenocara - run make targets in the specified subdir(s) for xenocara
# BUILD = ??? (defaults to src)

# Set SUBDIR to the directory where the patch gets applied and needs
# to be built. Multiple directories can be defined in case a library
# errata requires us to rebuild statically linked binaries.
# SUBDIR = ??? (defaults to empty)
# SUBDIR+= ???
#
# A helper target called `findstatic' is available so that a list of
# directories can be created. `make -f Makefile.000 LIB=util findstatic'
# will give a list of directories that have to be added to SUBDIR because
# they statically link libutil.
# This is a best-guess function so a manual check is always necessary.
