@new install media.  floppyXX.fs is the regular one.  floppyBXX.fs contains no
none of the scsi drivers on the first floppy, but others (to be detailed
elsewhere).  bsd.rd is still the one from floppyXX.fs.  finally, cdromXX.fs
is a 2.88MB install, which contains a superset of all these.. to be placed on
the CD.

However this stuff is largely related to NetBSD and must be completely
redone, if we will make real relases sometime
