@Cleanup/Improve trap handling.

a) Add /var/run to the filesystem created when the installation media
   boots. This allows the creation and use of the dhclient.pid file.
   Synchronize all mtree.conf files in architectures using miniroot.

b) Rework the traps used in upgrade.sh and install.sh so that HUP,
   INT, QUIT, TERM and EXIT all invoke a cleanup function that kills an
   active dhclient, unmounts all filesystems and fsck's -p all devices
   in /etc/fstab, or just /mnt if /etc/fstab is not present.

c) Make sure the actions of the cleanup function are visible, thus
   eliminating the long delay with no feedback at the end of the
   upgrade/install script, after the congratulatory message.

d) Reduce manual parsing of fstab files by using umount -a to
   unmount all mounted filesystems.

e) Since the new cleanup function tries to unmount all filesystems,
   use the presence of /etc/fstab, rather than a difference between
   `df /` and `df /mnt`, to determine if an install is being restarted
   in a state where disk initialization can be skipped.

f) Change munge_fs, check_fs, mount_fs, remount_fs so that they
   all 'know' about /etc/fstab rather than passing the same
   parameter in all the time.

g) Use input redirection on munge_fs to read correct file, rather
   than passing a file name as a parameter.

h) Indent code for various smaller functions.

i) Eliminate some subshell usage to simplify code further.

j) Display pretty messages during fsck -p to clearly indicate success
   or failure of fsck, rather than just dumping fsck output.

k) Always run mount_fs in install.sh, even if disk initialization is
   being skipped, because the trap should have unmounted all filesystems
   when the last run terminated.

@argh.  stop using kernfs, using dmesg using sysctl.  encode ARCH into
install.md at build time.  remove some crud.  and the icing on the cake:
skip testing all this until next week

@new install media.  floppyXX.fs is the regular one.  floppyBXX.fs contains no
none of the scsi drivers on the first floppy, but others (to be detailed
elsewhere).  bsd.rd is still the one from floppyXX.fs.  finally, cdromXX.fs
is a 2.88MB install, which contains a superset of all these.. to be placed on
the CD.
