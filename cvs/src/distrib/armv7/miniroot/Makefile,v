@Remove the miniroot for the OMAP3 BeagleBoards.  Ethernet is on USB and
USB isn't supported.  The installer turns out to have been broken on
BeagleBoard for over a year and no one noticed.  The existing support
for OMAP3 in the kernel remains though it isn't clear if anyone has
tried it after the fdt changes went in.

log
@Make use of u-boot 2015.07's unified wandboard config to provide a
miniroot to cover all current wandboard variations.

Unlike the other imx u-boot configs the wandboard config doesn't search
for ext2 only a fat fs.

Grow the ramdisk size to fit the extra u-boot files.

From Roman Kravchuk.

@Rename the imx miniroot to nitrogen as it creates "6x_bootscript".
Add a miniroot for the CuBox-i which needs u-boot at a particular
offset in the sd image to boot.  Based on changes made by Patrick
Wildt in bitrig.

@Rename miniroot-sunxi to miniroot-cubie as the u-boot included
in the image is for Cubieboard1.  Discussed with bmercer@@
While here switch from using the separate spl and u-boot images
to the combined spl and u-boot 'u-boot-sunxi-with-spl.bin'.

@hookup sunxi bits for miniroot and ramdisk, tested on pcduino.
note that on boards without ahci you will need to install to usb and still
boot of sd, at least until there's support for the sd slot.

1.2
log
@Revamp ARMv7 ramdisk and miniroot creation process.

Instead of running mkuboot during install, we call it on during
the release build, so that we can also ship bootable images
of the generic and the ramdisk kernel.

We can now build miniroots for imx, too.  The installer also
can recognize the SoC and makes decision based on it.

Use ext2fs for i.MX6 based devices.

Tar the bootloader files to save some space.
