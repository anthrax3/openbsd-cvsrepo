log
@Enhance '-g' to create a default GPT label in addition to the protective
MBR. If '-b' is specified an EFI System partition of the requested size is
created. All remaining space is put into an OpenBSD partition.

Minimal enhancement necessary for upcoming UEFI install support.
Committed first to flush out any unexpected impacts on 'normal' MBR
operation and install media.

log
@/bin and /sbin are moving towards static PIE, so on many architectures
the PIC .o files are unsuitable for static "instbin".  This adds more
work at build time, but the result will be optimized for size.
