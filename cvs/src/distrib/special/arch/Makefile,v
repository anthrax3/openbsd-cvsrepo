1.1
log
@In the new PIE world, all dynamic binaries (for instance those found
in usr.bin and usr.sbin on the install media) must be re-compiled non-PIE
(here, in the special directory) so that crunchgen can reuse them.  This
issue is most acute on i386, which has register pressure, and does weird
things for PIE.
thanks for matthew for helping figure this out.
