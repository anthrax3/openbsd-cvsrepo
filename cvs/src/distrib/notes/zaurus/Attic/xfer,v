@Jumbo commit for 4.7 installation instructions:
- do not mention tape as an installation media on systems where it is very
  unlikely that a tape drive can be connected to (i.e. anything with only
  USB as expansion capabilities)
- do not mention that fetching the installation sets from a partition is
  ``for upgrades only''. You may do this for installation, but of course
  you can not use a partition which will be newfs'ed for that purpose.
- mention ext2fs partitions as possible installation sets source only on
  platforms where the installation media actually can mount an ext2fs
  filesystem.
- stress the fact that the sparc miniroot image is a GENERIC kernel with
  a little on-disk filesystem, and not a RAMDISK kernel with a little
  in-memory filesystem, and thus must not be overwritten during installation
  (i.e. be careful if you repartition the disk the miniroot has been put on).
- more conv=sync -> conv=osync for tape setup instructions.
- model-specific layout changes on armish, loongson and socppc instructions.
- fix various typos and grammar mistaeks.
