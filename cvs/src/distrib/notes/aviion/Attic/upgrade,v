@Stop using the name `miniroot' when `bsd.rd' is implied. A few platforms
have a real miniroot to be dd'ed to the disk, and that's fine; but when
we are talking about booting bsd.rd (either from an existing setup, or the
network, or the cd-rom images), then refer to it as `installation kernel'.

To upgrade your OpenBSD installation, simply extract the new sets on
the diskless server.

It is strongly advised that you unpack the etc{:--:}OSrev.tgz set in
a temporary directory and merge changes by hand, since some components of
your system may not function correctly until your files in `/etc' are
updated.
