@Stop using the name `miniroot' when `bsd.rd' is implied. A few platforms
have a real miniroot to be dd'ed to the disk, and that's fine; but when
we are talking about booting bsd.rd (either from an existing setup, or the
network, or the cd-rom images), then refer to it as `installation kernel'.

@Tweak a few texts to cope with the fact that we ship official OpenBSD CD-ROM
and bootable CD-ROM mini images on some platforms, too. Mention such a mini
image for alpha, consistent spelling of CD-ROM, and a few minor updates not
worth mentioning I had lying in my tree.

Due to the youth of the MACHINE port, upgrades to OpenBSD OSREV are not
supported.
You are strongly advised to reinstall your existing machines from scratch.

Since OpenBSD OSREV is the first release for MACHINE systems, upgrades
are not expected.
If you have been using an old OpenBSD/MACHINE snapshot, you can follow the
following instructions.

@- U2 has been tested
- floppies have neither NFS nor CDROM support
- add a section about firmware upgrades, and tell that they might be
necessary, especially for U1/1E/2 systems. Pointed out from brad@@, some of
the information provided here comes from Sun's firmware update documentation.

@The final round of sparc64 installation notes updates:
- add miniroot and bootable cd-rom information
- fix a few wordings
- fix incorrect Solaris manual pages section names
- replace a rip-off of boot_sparc(8) with a more adequate rip-off of
  boot_sparc64(8)
