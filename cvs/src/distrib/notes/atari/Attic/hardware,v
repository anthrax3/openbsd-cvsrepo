@No need to keep installation notes for architectures we never
have supported.
@
text
@OpenBSD/MACHINE OSREV runs on a TT030 and a Falcon. Currently an FPU is
required, although this might change in the (near) future. The
minimum amount of RAM required is 4Mb.

Here is a table of recommended HD partition sizes for a full install:
	partition:	advise,	with X,	needed,	with X
	root (/)	15M	15M	10M	10M
	user (/usr)	65M	100M	45M 	80M
	swap		----- 2M for every M ram -----
	local (/local)	up to you

As you may note the recommended size of /usr is 20M greater than
needed. This is to leave room for a kernel source and compile tree
as you will probably want to compile your own kernel. (GENERIC is
large and bulky to accommodate all people, BOOT is small and might
not have all the features you want).

Supported devices {:-include-:}:
	- The built-in SCSI host adapter
		- Should support most SCSI-drives. The drives that are
		  currently tested are:
			MAXTOR 7245S, MAXTOR 7080S, SEAGATE ST157N
		- Should support most tape drives. The drives that are
		  currently tested are:
			TANDBERG 3600
		- Should support most CD-ROM drives.
	- The buildin video controller
	- The building (720Kb/1.44Mb) floppydrive
	- The serial2/modem2 ports
	- The Falcon FX memory expansion
	- The atari mouse

If its not on this list, there is no support for it in this release.

@Did some s/NetBSD/OpenBSD/, s/netbsd/bsd/ and $OpenBSD$ additions.
However this stuff is largely related to NetBSD and must be completely
redone, if we will make real relases sometime
