@Retire hp300, mvme68k and mvme88k ports. These ports have no users, keeping
this hardware alive is becoming increasingly difficult, and I should heed the
message sent by the three disks which have died on me over the last few days.

Noone sane will mourn these ports anyway. So long, and thanks for the fish.

log
@Try to catch up with installer changes in the installation notes.
Also, the per-platform features are moved to a common place, which makes
the MD layout easier to work on. m4.common is still a tangled mess of subtly
placed dnl, though...
