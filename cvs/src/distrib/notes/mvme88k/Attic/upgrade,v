@Retire hp300, mvme68k and mvme88k ports. These ports have no users, keeping
this hardware alive is becoming increasingly difficult, and I should heed the
message sent by the three disks which have died on me over the last few days.

Noone sane will mourn these ports anyway. So long, and thanks for the fish.

@Stop using the name `miniroot' when `bsd.rd' is implied. A few platforms
have a real miniroot to be dd'ed to the disk, and that's fine; but when
we are talking about booting bsd.rd (either from an existing setup, or the
network, or the cd-rom images), then refer to it as `installation kernel'.

To upgrade to OpenBSD OSREV from a previous version follow the instructions
in the section "Installing OpenBSD", but run the script `upgrade.sh'
in stead of `install.sh'.

The upgrade script will use the existing disk partitions to install the
new system in, and also preserves the files in `/etc'.
