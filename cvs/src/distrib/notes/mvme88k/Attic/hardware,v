@Retire hp300, mvme68k and mvme88k ports. These ports have no users, keeping
this hardware alive is becoming increasingly difficult, and I should heed the
message sent by the three disks which have died on me over the last few days.

Noone sane will mourn these ports anyway. So long, and thanks for the fish.

OpenBSD/MACHINE OSREV runs on the systems built around the following
MVME boards:

	- MVME181 (Barebone system with 88100 processor)
	- MVME187/M8120 (Single board computer with 88100 processor)
	- MVME188 (HYPERmodule-based systems with up to 4 88100 processors)
	- MVME197LE (Single board computer with 88110 processor)
	- MVME197SP/DP (Single board computer with up to two 88110 processors)

Besides various Motorola complete systems (M8120, Series 900, etc),
OpenBSD/MACHINE also runs on the MVME187-based Triton Dolphin
System 100.

OpenBSD/MACHINE OSREV supports MVME188 and MVME197DP SMP (Symmetrical
MultiProcessor) systems.  To support SMP operation, a separate SMP kernel
(bsd.mp) is included with the installation file sets.

While OpenBSD will boot single-user in 8MB, a minimum of 12MB of RAM is
necessary to install and boot multi-user, and 16MB of RAM are recommended
as a minimum for the system not to be swap-bound, with 32MB or more being
recommended for serious usage of the system.  A minimal system can probably
be squeezed onto a 250MB disk by installing only the `base' and `etc' sets
and using a small swap partition.

Note that until you have at least 32MB of RAM, getting more RAM is more
important than getting a faster CPU board.

Supported HYPERmodules: (for MVME188 systems)

	1P32 (1 88100 processor, 2 88200 CMMUs, similar to MVME187)
	1P64 (1 88100 processor, 4 88200 CMMUs)
	1P128 (1 88100 processor, 8 88200 CMMUs, untested)
	1P128 (1 88100 processor, 2 88204 CMMUs)
	1P256 (1 88100 processor, 4 88204 CMMUs)
	1P512 (1 88100 processor, 8 88204 CMMUs, untested)
	2P64 (2 88100 processors, 4 88200 CMMUs)
	2P128 (2 88100 processors, 8 88200 CMMUs)
	2P256 (2 88100 processors, 4 88204 CMMUs)
	2P512 (2 88100 processors, 8 88204 CMMUs)
	4P128 (4 88100 processors, 8 88200 CMMUs)
	4P512 (4 88100 processors, 8 88204 CMMUs)

Supported devices:

MVME181 on-board devices:
	serial ports, ttya-ttyb (dart)

MVME181 compatible VME memory boards:
	MVME224 and MVME224A (4, 8, 16 and 32MB)
	MVME236 (4, 8 and 16MB)

MVME187, M8120 and MVME197 on-board devices:
	Cirrus Logic CD2401 serial ports (cl)
	Intel 82596CA Ethernet (ie)
	NCR53c710 SCSI Controller (osiop)
	128KB SRAM (/dev/sram0)
	8KB NVRAM (/dev/nvram0)

MVME188 on-board devices:
	serial ports on SYSCON board (dart)
	2KB NVRAM (/dev/nvram0)

Additional VMEbus devices:

	MVME327A SCSI and floppy Controller (vsbic), currently limited
	    to the SCSI interface only
	MVME328 High Performance SCSI Controller (vs)
dnl	MVME332XT High Performance Serial I/O Controller (vx)

The minimal configuration requires 16MB of RAM and at least 200MB of disk
