@Retire hp300, mvme68k and mvme88k ports. These ports have no users, keeping
this hardware alive is becoming increasingly difficult, and I should heed the
message sent by the three disks which have died on me over the last few days.

Noone sane will mourn these ports anyway. So long, and thanks for the fish.

	FFS partitions
	Tape
	Remote NFS partition
	FTP
	HTTP

@Jumbo commit for 4.7 installation instructions:
- do not mention tape as an installation media on systems where it is very
  unlikely that a tape drive can be connected to (i.e. anything with only
  USB as expansion capabilities)
- do not mention that fetching the installation sets from a partition is
  ``for upgrades only''. You may do this for installation, but of course
  you can not use a partition which will be newfs'ed for that purpose.
- mention ext2fs partitions as possible installation sets source only on
  platforms where the installation media actually can mount an ext2fs
  filesystem.
- stress the fact that the sparc miniroot image is a GENERIC kernel with
  a little on-disk filesystem, and not a RAMDISK kernel with a little
  in-memory filesystem, and thus must not be overwritten during installation
  (i.e. be careful if you repartition the disk the miniroot has been put on).
- more conv=sync -> conv=osync for tape setup instructions.
- model-specific layout changes on armish, loongson and socppc instructions.
- fix various typos and grammar mistaeks.

The steps necessary to prepare the distribution sets
for installation depend on which method of installation
you choose.  The various methods are explained below.

To prepare for installing via an NFS partition:

	Place the OpenBSD software you wish to install into
	a directory on an NFS server, and make that directory
	mountable by the machine which you will be installing
	OpenBSD on.  This will probably require modifying the
	/etc/exports file of the NFS server and resetting
	mountd, acts which will require superuser privileges.
	Note the numeric IP address of the NFS server and of
	the router closest to the new OpenBSD machine,
	if the NFS server is not on a network which is
	directly attached to the OpenBSD machine.

	If you are using a diskless setup to install OpenBSD on
	your machine, you can take advantage of the fact that
	the above has already been done on your machine's server.
	So, you can conveniently put the OpenBSD filesets in your
	machine's root filesystem on the server where the install
	program can find them.

	Once you have done this, you can proceed to the next
	step in the installation process, preparing your
	system for OpenBSD installation.

To prepare for installing via FTP:

	NOTE: this method of installation is recommended
	      only for those already familiar with using
	      the BSD network-manipulation commands and
	      interfaces.  If you aren't, this documentation
	      should help, but is not intended to be
	      all-encompassing.

	The preparations for this method of installation
	are easy: all you have to do is make sure that
	there's some FTP site from which you can retrieve
	the OpenBSD installation when it's time to do
	the install.  You should know the numeric IP
	address of that site, the numeric IP address of
	your nearest router if one is necessary

	Once you have done this, you can proceed to the next
	step in the installation process, preparing your
	system for OpenBSD installation.

To prepare for installing via a tape:

	To install OpenBSD from a tape, you need to somehow
	make a boot tape on the appropriate kind of tape.
	The files needed for this are:
	
	stboot 	  - The Motorola VID block
	bootst 	  - The bootstrap program
	bsd.rd.gz - The ramdisk installation kernel
	
	If you're making the tape on a UN*X system, the easiest
	way to do so is:
	
	dd obs=512 if=stboot of=<no-rewind tape_device>
	dd obs=512 if=bootst of=<no-rewind tape_device>
	dd conv=sync obs=512 if=bsd.rd.gz of=<no-rewind tape_device>
	
	where "<no-rewind tape_device>" is the name of the tape device
	that describes the tape drive you're using (possibly
	something like /dev/nrst0, but we make no guarantees 8-).
		
	Now you need to get the OpenBSD filesets you wish to
	install on your system on to the appropriate kind of tape,
	in tar format.

	If you're making the tape on a UN*X system, the easiest
	way to do so is:

		tar cvf <tape_device> <files>

	where "<tape_device>" is the name of the tape device
	that describes the tape drive you're using (possibly
	something like /dev/nrst0, but again, we make no guarantees 8-).
	Under SunOS 5.x, this would be something like /dev/rmt/0mbn.
	Again, your mileage may vary.  If you can't figure it out,
	ask your system administrator.  "<files>" are the names
	of the "set_name.nnn" files which you want to be placed
	on the tape.

	Once you have done this, you can proceed to the next
	step in the installation process, preparing your
	system for OpenBSD installation.
