@Retire hp300, mvme68k and mvme88k ports. These ports have no users, keeping
this hardware alive is becoming increasingly difficult, and I should heed the
message sent by the three disks which have died on me over the last few days.

Noone sane will mourn these ports anyway. So long, and thanks for the fish.

OpenBSD/mvme88k 2.3 was written because the MVME187 existed in a computer
company basement.  Nivas Madhur started the port.  Steve Murphree, Jr.
finished the port in December 1998.  Code by Dale Rahn, Theo de Raadt,
and Chuck Cranor was used as a starting point. Currently this port runs
on MVME187 and perhaps other models also.
