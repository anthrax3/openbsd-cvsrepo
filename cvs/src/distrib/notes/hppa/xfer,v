@Jumbo commit for 4.7 installation instructions:
- do not mention tape as an installation media on systems where it is very
  unlikely that a tape drive can be connected to (i.e. anything with only
  USB as expansion capabilities)
- do not mention that fetching the installation sets from a partition is
  ``for upgrades only''. You may do this for installation, but of course
  you can not use a partition which will be newfs'ed for that purpose.
- mention ext2fs partitions as possible installation sets source only on
  platforms where the installation media actually can mount an ext2fs
  filesystem.
- stress the fact that the sparc miniroot image is a GENERIC kernel with
  a little on-disk filesystem, and not a RAMDISK kernel with a little
  in-memory filesystem, and thus must not be overwritten during installation
  (i.e. be careful if you repartition the disk the miniroot has been put on).
- more conv=sync -> conv=osync for tape setup instructions.
- model-specific layout changes on armish, loongson and socppc instructions.
- fix various typos and grammar mistaeks.

@Better documentation on how to install the latest OpenBSD/hppa snapshots.
These notes are slowly starting to get in shape when compared to other
architectures, although there are still some unclear points and rought edges
(not even mentioning a couple of references to an upgrade feature...)

Since there is no installation media for the MACHINE port, there is no need
for specific media filling instructions. You will just need to be able to
unpack the OpenBSD sets on the diskless boot server, as told in the
``Installing the OpenBSD system'' below.
