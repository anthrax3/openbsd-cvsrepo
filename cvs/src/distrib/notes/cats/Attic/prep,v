@Retire OpenBSD/cats. Hardware is nice but prone to catch fire, and the firmware
is anything but useful. Nevertheless this was a very good platform to use as
an OpenBSD/*arm* starting point, but nowadays this platform is not necessary
anymore.

Somehow these CATS motherboard are just like AUI hubs, with the difference that,
when my AUI hub caught fire, 10base5 support was not removed from the networking
code.

To be able to boot the OpenBSD/MACHINE installation program, you will
need to acquire some limited knowledge of ABLE Firmware, the low-level
process that controls the microprocessor after hardware initialization
and diagnostics are performed but before control is handed to the
operating system.

A complete documentation on the ABLE firmware is available from Simtec at
the following URL:
  http://www.simtec.co.uk/products/SWABLE/files/able-doc-allset/

The board should be configured with jumpers LK12, LK13, and LK14
set to the 1-2 position. However, most boards have been factory shipped
with those jumpers incorrectly set to the 2-3 position. These jumpers are
located as a block of three jumpers, near the processor and the serial
ports. More information about this jumper change can be found at the
following URL:
  http://www.simtec.co.uk/products/EB110ATX/files/eb110atx-pcn001.html

** Note!
    You will need ABLE version 1.95 or better in order to be able
    to boot OpenBSD/MACHINE. Firmware updates are available from
    Simtec at the following URL:
      http://www.simtec.co.uk/products/EB110ATX/resources.html


For convenience, a few ABLE commands are described below:

	(hd0)bsd
		boots the ELF file 'bsd' from the disk partition
		identified by firmware as hd0.

	nvset variable value
		sets a firmware environment variable.

	nvsave
		saves all variable changes to non-volatile memory.

	nvclear
		restores environment variables' defaults.

The following environment variables control the system startup:

	boot.auto
		when set to "true" (which is its default value), the
		system will attempt to execute the command set in the
		"boot.cmd" variable after "boot.timeout" seconds, unless
		the boot process is interrupted by a keypress.

	boot.cmd
		command used to auto-boot, such as "(hd0)bsd" to
		boot the bsd kernel from the first hard disk partition.

	boot.timeout
		delay until the system boots, in seconds.

	ide.multi-limit
		restricts the number of sectors read in a single command,
		if necessary. This value needs to be set only if ABLE can
		not access and boot from OpenBSD filesystems correctly.
		A value of "1" ought to work in all cases.
