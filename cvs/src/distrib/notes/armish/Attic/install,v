@armish handled some early-gen arm machines, which required tons of
workarounds.  Some of them will soon stand in the way of armv7.
Off to the attic you go.

@Try to catch up with installer changes in the installation notes.
Also, the per-platform features are moved to a common place, which makes
the MD layout easier to work on. m4.common is still a tangled mess of subtly

	Next you will have to edit or create a disk label for the disk
	OpenBSD is being installed on.  If there are any existing
	partitions defined (for any operating system), and a disk label
	is not found, you will first be given an opportunity to run
	fdisk and create an OpenBSD partition.

	If fdisk is being invoked on your behalf, it will start by
	displaying the current partitions defined and then allow you
	to modify this information, add new partitions and change
	which partition to boot from by default.  If you make a mistake,
	you will be allowed to repeat this procedure as necessary to
	correct this.  Note that you should make OpenBSD be the active
	partition at least until the install has been completed.

	You will next be asked for your terminal type.  If you are
	installing from a non-serial console, the default of "vt220"
	is correct.  If you are installing from a serial console
	you should choose the terminal type from amongst those listed.
	(If your terminal type is xterm, just use vt220.)

	Note that all OpenBSD partitions in the disk label must have an
	offset that makes it start within the OpenBSD part of the disk,
	and a size that keeps it inside of that portion of the disk.  This
	is within the bounds of the 'c' partition if the disk is not being
	shared with other operating systems, and within the OpenBSD fdisk
	partition if the disk is being shared.

@Better description of the installation steps:
- document questions in proper order: hostname before network configuration,
  DNS only if network is configured, sshd and ntpd, aperture only on
  machines which need it, serial console only on machines which need it.
  This is done by splitting the end of OpenBSDCommonURL in various
  macros, OpenBSDInstallWrapup, OpenBSDInstallAperture, OpenBSDInstallConsole
  and OpenBSDInstallWrapupPart2.
- use the above macros when appropriate, OpenBSDInstallWrapup* being
  mandatory on all arches.
- remove serial console configuration blurb on sparc and sparc64, it is
  handled by OpenBSDInstallConsole now.

@Your spring jumbo m4-fu. This time:
- mention comp contains an objective-C compiler too.
- rewrite InstallPrelude so that it will only output the ``know your drive
  geometry'' blurb if asked to, and for a specified disk type. Use it for
  non-IDE and non-SCSI disks only, otherwise the kernel is good enough to
  do the job without the users' help.
- similarily, adapt BootMsgs to make the second part of the geometry blurb
  optional, and to accept up to three disk types. Use this to report better
  disk names (i.e. no point saying an scsi disk would show up as sd0 on
  platforms which can't have scsi disks, or won't be able to boot from them).
- in InstallPart4, drop the part about block and fragment sizes in
  disklabel. The defaults are good, and you won't get to change them unless
  you switched to expert mode.
- the default answer to ``wanna get the ftp mirror list, unzel?'' is ``no'',
  so pressing enter to get it is not enough anymore (-:
