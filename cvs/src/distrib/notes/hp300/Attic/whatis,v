@Retire hp300, mvme68k and mvme88k ports. These ports have no users, keeping
this hardware alive is becoming increasingly difficult, and I should heed the
message sent by the three disks which have died on me over the last few days.

Noone sane will mourn these ports anyway. So long, and thanks for the fish.

@68020-based hp300 systems are not supported anymore now. If you still use
any, I'll suggest you buy a boat so that they can be recycled as boat anchors.
