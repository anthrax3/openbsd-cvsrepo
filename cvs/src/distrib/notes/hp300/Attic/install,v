@Retire hp300, mvme68k and mvme88k ports. These ports have no users, keeping
this hardware alive is becoming increasingly difficult, and I should heed the

Noone sane will mourn these ports anyway. So long, and thanks for the fish.

OpenBSDInstallPrelude({:-HP-IB disks-:})

The ramdisk kernel may be loaded from the network, from CD-ROM, or other
SCSI devices (such as Zip(tm) disk).  Note that loading from HP-IB or SCSI
cartridge tape is possible, but not currently supported.


Booting from CD-ROM installation media:

You can burn a bootable CD-ROM and boot from it.
To boot from SCSI CD-ROM, simply insert the CD into the drive before power
up, then during the computer's self-test cycle, press the space bar.
Shortly, you should see a menu of possible boot options appear. Select the
option corresponding to SYS_CDBOOT. SYS_CDBOOT will then load and begin
loading bsd.rd from the CD-ROM; depending on your ROM revision and hardware
configuration, you may or may not see any messages on the console while this
happens.

Please note that booting from CD-ROM may not be supported by all models of
MACHINE.  You will also need a CD-ROM drive which uses 512-byte blocks;
anything which shipped with an MACHINE or is known to boot a SPARC or black
NeXTStation should work.  Modern CD-ROM drives jumpered to use 512-byte
blocks should work as well.


Booting from Network:

If you wish to load the SYS_UBOOT program via the network, you need to
either have another OpenBSD system on the network, or something else
capable of running the rbootd(8) program.  Source code may be found
under usr.sbin/rbootd in the OpenBSD source tree, but requires the
Berkeley Packet Filter (bpf) in order to function.  It may be possible to
use HP-UX, but it is not recommended (or documented here).  For more
information on diskless booting under OpenBSD, see the diskless(8)
manual page.

First of all, configure your rbootd to handle boot requests from the
client.  NOTE: OpenBSD's `rbootd' is slightly different from HP-UX's.
To configure OpenBSD's `rbootd', create a file called `/etc/rbootd.conf'
and place in it an entry like the following:

	08:00:09:04:AA:33	SYS_UBOOT	# thunder-egg

The first column is the Ethernet address of the client's network interface.
The second column is the program to send to the client, and anything after
the `#' is a comment.  Once you have rbootd running, copy the SYS_UBOOT
program to the /usr/mdec/rbootd directory on your server.  If this
directory doesn't exist already, you will need to create it.

Next, add the client to /etc/ethers on your server.  For example:

	08:00:09:04:AA:33	thunder-egg

Then start `rarpd' on your server; `rarpd -a' should do the trick.

Finally, you need to add an entry in /etc/bootparams.  For example:

	thunder-egg	root=myserver:/export/MACHINE

Where myserver is the name of your server machine and `/export/MACHINE'
is the directory that holds the ramdisk kernel image (`bsd.rd').
Now run `rpc.bootparamd' and make sure that this directory is NFS
exported to the client.  See the manual pages on your server system
if you need more information about exporting filesystems.  If you
run into problems you may wish to run `rpc.bootparamd' with the `-d'
flag on your server to get extra debugging information.

You are now ready to load SYS_UBOOT.  During the client's self-test cycle,
press the space bar.  Shortly after, you should see a menu of possible boot
options appear.  Select the option corresponding to SYS_UBOOT.
SYS_UBOOT will then load and prompt you for a kernel name.  NFS file
names should not have a leading '/' prepended to them; simply use `bsd.rd'.


Installing using the CD-ROM or netboot procedure:

OpenBSDInstallPart2

	Boot your machine from the installation media as described above.

	When presented with the boot prompt, enter the path of your kernel
	(which is likely to be `bsd.rd').

	It will take a while to load the kernel especially from a slow
	speed CD-ROM or slow network connection, most likely more than
	a minute.  If some action doesn't eventually happen, or the
	spinning cursor has stopped and nothing further has happened,
	either your boot media is bad, your diskless setup is incorrect,
	or you may have a hardware or configuration problem.

OpenBSDInstallPart3(warn,{:-"sd0" for SCSI drives-:},{:-or "hd0" for HP-IB
	drives-:})

OpenBSDInstallPart4

OpenBSDInstallPart5

	Since the target disk will become the boot disk for your new
	OpenBSD/MACHINE installation, the disklabel program will restrict
	the available disk area to keep the first cylinder, which will
	contain the bootblock, safe from being overwritten. If you don't
	plan to install a bootblock on this disk, you can reclaim this
	space with the 'b' command.

@Jumbo commit for 4.7 installation instructions:
- do not mention tape as an installation media on systems where it is very
  unlikely that a tape drive can be connected to (i.e. anything with only
  USB as expansion capabilities)
- do not mention that fetching the installation sets from a partition is
  ``for upgrades only''. You may do this for installation, but of course
  you can not use a partition which will be newfs'ed for that purpose.
- mention ext2fs partitions as possible installation sets source only on
  platforms where the installation media actually can mount an ext2fs
  filesystem.
- stress the fact that the sparc miniroot image is a GENERIC kernel with
  a little on-disk filesystem, and not a RAMDISK kernel with a little
  in-memory filesystem, and thus must not be overwritten during installation
  (i.e. be careful if you repartition the disk the miniroot has been put on).
- more conv=sync -> conv=osync for tape setup instructions.
- model-specific layout changes on armish, loongson and socppc instructions.
- fix various typos and grammar mistaeks.

@Better description of the installation steps:
- document questions in proper order: hostname before network configuration,
  DNS only if network is configured, sshd and ntpd, aperture only on
  machines which need it, serial console only on machines which need it.
  This is done by splitting the end of OpenBSDCommonURL in various
  macros, OpenBSDInstallWrapup, OpenBSDInstallAperture, OpenBSDInstallConsole
  and OpenBSDInstallWrapupPart2.
- use the above macros when appropriate, OpenBSDInstallWrapup* being
  mandatory on all arches.

  handled by OpenBSDInstallConsole now.

@Your spring jumbo m4-fu. This time:
- mention comp contains an objective-C compiler too.
- rewrite InstallPrelude so that it will only output the ``know your drive
  geometry'' blurb if asked to, and for a specified disk type. Use it for
  non-IDE and non-SCSI disks only, otherwise the kernel is good enough to
  do the job without the users' help.
- similarily, adapt BootMsgs to make the second part of the geometry blurb
  optional, and to accept up to three disk types. Use this to report better
  disk names (i.e. no point saying an scsi disk would show up as sd0 on
  platforms which can't have scsi disks, or won't be able to boot from them).
- in InstallPart4, drop the part about block and fragment sizes in
  disklabel. The defaults are good, and you won't get to change them unless
  you switched to expert mode.
- the default answer to ``wanna get the ftp mirror list, unzel?'' is ``no'',
  so pressing enter to get it is not enough anymore (-:

	After entering the terminal type you will be asked whether you
	wish to do an "(I)nstall" or an "(U)pgrade".  Enter 'I' for a
	fresh install or 'U' to upgrade an existing installation.

	You will be presented with a welcome message and asked if
	you really wish to install (or upgrade).  Assuming you
	answered yes, the install program will then tell you which
	disks of that type it can install on, and ask you which it
	should use.  The name of the disk is typically "hd0" for
	HPIB/CS80 drives or "sd0" for SCSI drives.  Reply with the
	name of your disk.
d119 1
a119 11
	Next the disk label which defines the layout of the OpenBSD
	file systems must be set up.  The installation script will
	invoke an interactive editor allowing you to do this.  Note
	that partition 'c' inside this disk label should ALWAYS
	reflect the entire disk, including any non-OpenBSD portions.
	The root file system should be in partition 'a', and swap
	is usually in partition 'b'.  It is recommended that you
	create separate partitions for /usr and /var, and if you
	have room for it, one for /home.  For help in the disk
	label editor, enter '?' or 'M' to view the manual page (see
	the info on the ``-E'' flag).
d128 5
a132 51
	The swap partition (usually 'b') should have a type of "swap", all
	other native OpenBSD partitions should have a type of "4.2BSD".
	Block and fragment sizes are usually 8192 and 1024 bytes, but can
	also be 4096 and 512 or even 16384 and 2048 bytes.

	The install program will now label your disk and ask which file
	systems should be created on which partitions.  It will
	automatically select the 'a' partition to be the root file system.
	Next it will ask for which disk and partition you want a file system
	created on.  This will be the same as the disk name (e.g. "hd0")
	with the letter identifying the partition (e.g. "d") appended (e.g.
	"hd0d").  Then it will ask where this partition is to be mounted,
	e.g. /usr.  This process will be repeated until you enter "done".

	At this point you will be asked to confirm that the file system
	information you have entered is correct, and given an opportunity
	to change the file system table.  Next it will create the new file
	systems as specified, OVERWRITING ANY EXISTING DATA.  This is the
	point of no return.

	After all your file systems have been created, the install program
	will give you an opportunity to configure the network.  The network
	configuration you enter (if any) can then be used to do the install
	from another system using NFS, HTTP or FTP, and will also be the
	configuration used by the system after the installation is complete.

	If you select to configure the network, the install program will
	ask you for a name of your system and the DNS domain name to use.
	Note that the host name should be without the domain part, and that
	the domain name should NOT {:-include-:} the host name part.

	Next the system will give you a list of network interfaces you can
	configure.  For each network interface you select to configure, it
	will ask for the IP address to use, the symbolic host name to use,
	the netmask to use and any interface-specific flags to set.  No
	interface-specific flags should be required.

	After all network interfaces have been configured the install
	program will ask for a default route and IP address of the primary
	name server to use.  You will also be presented with an opportunity
	to edit the host table.

	At this point you will be allowed to edit the file system table
	that will be used for the remainder of the installation and that
	will be used by the finished system, following which the new file
	systems will be mounted to complete the installation.

	After these preparatory steps have been completed, you will be
	able to extract the distribution sets onto your system.  There
	are several install methods supported; FTP, HTTP, tape, CD-ROM, NFS
	or a local disk partition.

Installing OpenBSD is a relatively complex process, but if you have
this document in hand and are careful to read and remember the
information which is presented to you by the install program, it
shouldn't be too much trouble.

Before you begin, you should know the geometry of your hard disk, i.e.
the sector size (note that sector sizes other than 512 bytes are not
currently supported), the number of sectors per track, the number of
tracks per cylinder (also known as the number of heads), and the
number of cylinders on the disk.  The OpenBSD kernel will try to
discover these parameters on its own, and if it can it will print them
at boot time.  If possible, you should use the parameters it prints.
(You might not be able to if your disk is so old that the
kernel can't figure out its geometry.)
d5 1
a5 6
The following is a walk-through of the steps you will take while
getting OpenBSD installed on your hard disk.  If any question has a
default answer, it will be displayed in brackets ("[]") after the
question.  If you wish to stop the installation, you may hit Control-C
at any time, but if you do, you'll have to begin the installation
process again from scratch.
d11 1
a11 10
	You will then be presented with the OpenBSD kernel boot
	messages.  You will want to read them, to determine your
	disk's name and geometry.  Its name will be something like
	"sd0" or "hd0" and any geometry or size information will be
	printed on a line that begins with its name.  As mentioned above,
	you will need your disk's geometry when creating OpenBSD's
	partitions.  You will also need to know the name, to tell the
	install tools what disk to install on.  If you cannot read the
	messages as they scroll by, do not worry -- you can get at this
	information later inside the install program.

	To install via FTP:
		To begin an FTP install you will need the following
		pieces of information.  Don't be daunted by this list;
		the defaults are sufficient for most people.
		    1) Proxy server URL if you are using a URL-based
		       ftp proxy (squid, CERN ftp, Apache 1.2 or higher).
		       You need to define a proxy if you are behind a
		       firewall that blocks outgoing ftp (assuming you
		       have a proxy available to use).
		    2) Do you need to use active mode ftp?  By default,
		       ftp will attempt to use passive mode and fall
		       back to an active connection if the server does
		       not support passive mode.  You only need to enable
		       this option if you are connecting to a buggy ftp
		       daemon that implements passive ftp incorrectly.
		       Note that you will not be asked about active
		       ftp if you are using a proxy.
		    3) The IP address (or hostname if you enabled
		       DNS earlier in the install) of an ftp server
		       carrying the OpenBSD 2.3 distribution.
		       If you don't know, just hit return when
		       asked if you want to see a list of such hosts.
		    4) The ftp directory holding the distribution sets.
		       The default value of pub/OpenBSD/2.3/hp300
		       is almost always correct.
		    5) The login and password for the ftp account.
		       The default will be correct unless you are
		       doing non-anonymous ftp.

		For instructions on how to complete the installation via
		ftp, see the section named "Common URL installations" below.

	To install via HTTP:
		To begin an HTTP install you will need the following
		pieces of information:
		    1) Proxy server URL if you are using a URL-based
		       http proxy (squid, CERN ftp, Apache 1.2 or higher).
		       You need to define a proxy if you are behind a
		       firewall that blocks outgoing http connections
		       (assuming you have a proxy available to use).
		    3) The IP address (or hostname if you enabled
		       DNS earlier in the install) of an http server
		       carrying the OpenBSD 2.3 distribution.
		       If you don't know, just hit return when
		       asked if you want to see a list of such hosts.
		    4) The directory holding the distribution sets.
		       There is no standard location for this;
		       You should use the directory specified
		       along with the server in the list of official
		       http mirror sites that you received in step 3.

		For instructions on how to complete the installation via
		http, see the section named "Common URL installations" below.

	To install from tape:
		In order to install from tape, the distribution sets to be
		installed must have been written to tape previously, either
		in tar format or gzip-compressed tar format.

		You will also have to identify the tape device where the
		distribution sets are to be extracted from.  This will
		typically be "nrst0" (no-rewind, raw interface).

		Next you will have to provide the file number of the set
		that is to be extracted.  Note that the file number starts
		at 1, which is the first file written to the tape.

		The install program will not automatically detect whether
		an image has been compressed, so it will ask for that
		information before starting the extraction.

	To install from CD-ROM:
		When installing from a CD-ROM, you will be asked which
		device holds the distribution sets.  For the hp300, this
		will show up as a normal scsi device, lile "sd4" for a
		CD-ROM at SCSI id 4.  Next you will be asked which partition
		on the CD-ROM the distribution is to be loaded from.  This
		is normally partition "a".

		Next you will have to identify the file system type that
		has been used to create the distribution on the CD-ROM,
		this can be either FFS or ISO CD9660.  The OpenBSD CD
		distribution uses the CD9660 format.

		You will also have to provide the relative path to the
		directory on the CD which holds the distribution, for the
		hp300 this is "2.3/hp300".

		For instructions on how to complete the installation from
		the CD-ROM distribution, see the section named "Common
		file system installations" below.

	To install from a NFS mounted directory:
		When installing from a NFS-mounted directory, you must
		have completed network configuration above, and also
		set up the exported file system on the NFS server in
		advance.

		First you must identify the IP address of the NFS server
		to load the distribution from, and the file system the
		server expects you to mount.

		The install program will also ask whether or not TCP
		should be used for transport (the default is UDP).  Note
		that TCP only works with newer NFS servers.

		You will also have to provide the relative path to the
		directory on the file system where the distribution sets
		are located.  Note that this path should not be prefixed
		with a '/'.

		For instructions on how to complete the installation from
		the CD-ROM distribution, see the section named "Common
		file system installations" below.

	To install from a local disk partition:
		When installing from a local disk partition, you will
		first have to identify which disk holds the distribution
		sets.  This is normally "hdN" or "sdN" where N is a
		number 0 through 9.  Next you will have to identify the
		partition within that disk that holds the distribution,
		this is a single letter between 'a' and 'p'.

		You will also have to identify the type of file system
		residing in the partition identified.  Currently, you can
		only install from partitions that use the fast file system
		(ffs).

		You will also have to provide the relative path to the
		directory on the file system where the distribution sets
		are located.  Note that this path should not be prefixed
		with a '/'.

		For instructions on how to complete the installation from
		the a local disk partition, see the next section.

	Common file system installations:
		The following instructions are common to installations
		from local disk partitions, NFS mounted directories and
		CD-ROMs.

		A list of available distribution sets will be listed.
		You may individually select distribution sets to install
		or enter `all' to install all of the sets (which is what
		most users will want to do).  You may also enter `list'
		to get a file list or `done' when you are done selecting
		distribution sets.  You may also use wildcards in place of
		a file name, eg `*.tar.gz' or even `base*|comp*'.  It is
		also possible to enter an arbitrary filename and have it
		treated as a file set.

		Once you have selected the file sets you want to install
		and entered `done' you will be prompted to verify that
		you really do want to extract file sets.  Assuming you
		acquiesce, the files will begin to extract.  If not, you
		will be given the option of installing sets via one of
		the other install methods.

	Common URL installations:
		Once you have entered the required information, the
		install program will fetch a file list and present
		a list of all the distribution sets that were found
		in the specified directory.  (If no valid sets were found,
		you will be notified and given the option of unpacking
		any gzipped tar files found or getting a file list if
		none were found.)

		At this point you may individually select distribution
		sets to install or enter `all' to install all of the
		sets (which is what most users will want to do).  You
		may also enter `list' to get a file list or `done' when
		you are done selecting distribution sets.  You may also
		use wildcards in place of a file name, eg `*.tar.gz' or
		even `base*|comp*'.  It is also possible to enter an
		arbitrary filename and have it treated as a file set.

		Once you have selected the file sets you want to install
		and entered `done' you will be prompted to verify that
		you really do want to download and install the files.
		Assuming you acquiesce, the files will begin to download
		and unpack.  If not, you will be given the option of
		installing sets via one of the other install methods.


	When all the selected distribution sets has been extracted, you
	will be allowed to select which time zone your system will be
	using, all the device nodes needed by the installed system will
	be created for you and the file systems will be unmounted.  For
	this to work properly, it is expected that you have installed
	at least the "base23" and "etc23" distribution sets.


Congratulations, you have successfully installed OpenBSD 2.3.  When you
reboot into OpenBSD, you should log in as "root" at the login prompt.
There is no initial password, but if you're using the machine in a
networked environment, you should create yourself an account and
protect it and the "root" account with good passwords.

Some of the files in the OpenBSD 2.3 distribution might need to be
tailored for your site.  In particular, the /etc/sendmail.cf file will
almost definitely need to be adjusted, and other files in /etc will
probably need to be modified, as well.  If you are unfamiliar with
UN*X-like system administration, it's recommended that you buy a book
that discusses it.

The miniroot's install program is very simple to use.  It will guide
you through the entire process, and is well automated.  Additional
improvements are planned for future releases.

The miniroot's install program will:

	* Allow you to place disklabels on additional disks.
	  Note that partition sizes and offsets are expressed
	  in sectors.  When you fill out the disklabel, you will
	  need to specify partition types and filesystem parameters.
	  If you're unsure what the these values should be, use the
	  following:

		fstype: 4.2BSD
		fsize: 1024
		bsize: 4096
		cpg: 16

	  If the partition will be a swap partition, use the following:

		fstype: swap
		fsize: 0 (or blank)
		bsize: 0 (or blank)
		cpg: 0 (or blank)

	  You will also need to specify the number of partitions.
	  The number of partitions is determined by the `index' of
	  the last partition letter, where a == 1, b == 2, etc.
	  Therefore, if the last filled partition is partition `g',
	  there are 7 partitions.  Any partitions with size of 0
	  may be removed from the list.

	  If the disk is the boot disk, you _must_ offset the root
	  partition (`a') one cylinder, as the hp300 boot code
	  if large enough to spill past the label area.  In this case,
	  the `c' partition must be fstype `boot'.

	  Anything after a `#' is a comment.

	  The following is an example disklabel partition map:

7 partitions:
#        size   offset    fstype   [fsize bsize   cpg]
  a:    30912      448    4.2BSD     1024  8192    16   # (Cyl.    1 - 69)
  b:   130816    31360      swap                        # (Cyl.   70 - 361)
  c:  1296512        0      boot                        # (Cyl.    0 - 2893)
  e:    81984   162176    4.2BSD     1024  8192    16   # (Cyl.  362 - 544)
  f:   102592   244160    4.2BSD     1024  4096    16   # (Cyl.  545 - 773)
  g:   949760   346752    4.2BSD     1024  8192    16   # (Cyl.  774 - 2893)

	* Create filesystems on target partitions.

	* Allow you to set up your system's network configuration.
	  Remember to specify host names without the domain name
	  appended to the end.  For example use `foo' instead of
	  `foo.bar.org'.  If, during the process of configuring
	  the network interfaces, you make a mistake, you will
	  be able to re-configure that interface by simply selecting
	  it for configuration again.

	* Mount target filesystems.  You will be given the opportunity
	  to manually edit the resulting /etc/fstab.

	* Extract binary sets from the media of your choice.

	* Copy configuration information gathered during the
	  installation process to your root filesystem.

	* Make device nodes in your root filesystem.

	* Copy a new kernel onto your root partition.

	* Install a new boot block.

	* Check your filesystems for integrity.

First-time installation on a system through a method other than the
installation program is possible, but strongly discouraged.

NOTE:  In the following examples you will see references to
disk devices.  For those not familiar with NetBSD, the following
prefixes are used to denote drive types:
d5 1
a5 2
	sd	SCSI disk
	rd	HP-IB disk
d7 3
a9 3
In the examples that follow, `rd' will be used.  The steps are
exactly the same for `sd' disks.  Only the names have changed
to protect the innocent.
d11 1
a11 2
Assuming you have read this document thoroughly and kept good notes
about your partitions, the rest should be fairly straight forward.
d13 7
a19 2
Before you begin, you must have already prepared the target disk
as detailed in the section on preparing your system for install.
d21 2
a22 4
The following is a walk-through of the steps necessary to finish
what the preparation process has already begun.  You may choose to
stop the process at any time, but if you do, it's recommended that
you start over from scratch.
d24 1
a24 6
	First you need to boot off of the target disk which
	you have made in the preparation process.  To do this,
	halt HP-UX, power-cycle your machine, and hit the space
	bar during the boot ROM's probing/testing sequence.
	You should eventually be presented with a list of systems
	from which to boot.  You want the one called `SYS_PBOOT'.
d26 2
a27 5
	After selecting `SYS_PBOOT', your system should load the
	NetBSD boot block and ask you for a kernel to load.
	Enter the following to boot NetBSD into single-user mode.
	(Note: it will come into single-user anyway, as there is
	not yet an fstab, but this makes it happen more gracefully.)
d29 1
a29 1
		netbsd -s
d31 1
a31 3
	The kernel will now load, and configure your hardware.
	Make a note of the device it lists when mounting the
	root filesystem.  It should look something like this:
d33 1
a33 1
		Changing root device to rd0a
d35 1
a35 2
	The message above is an example only.  Your message may
	be different.
d37 2
a38 176
	Check the root filesystem.  Use the raw flavor of the
	device listed during the `Changing root device...'
	message.  Example:

		fsck -p /dev/rrd0a

	Mount the root filesystem:

		mount /dev/rd0a /

	It's now time to newfs all of the other partitions you
	listed in your disk label.  So, for example, if rd0e and
	rd0f were to have filesystems put on them, you would
	do the following:

		newfs /dev/rrd0e
		newfs /dev/rrd0f

	Ensure that the mount-points for these filesystems are clean.
	If these filesystems are to be /var and /usr, respectively,
	just check that there are no files in those directories.
	There shouldn't be.  Once you've made sure, go ahead and
	mount those filesystems.

	It's now time to get the distribution sets onto the root
	or other filesystem.  There are several programs in /ibin
	to help you with this.  At your disposal, you have:

		ftp
		gzip
		tar
		extract

	Except for extract, which is just a script to help the
	process along, these are statically-linked versions of
	themselves, which normally appear in /usr/bin.

	If you placed the distribution sets on tape, go to the
	directory where you wish to temporarily place them and
	extract them from tape, using /dev/nrstX for SCSI tapes
	or /dev/nrctX for HP-IB cartridge tapes, where X is the
	unit number of the tape, probably 0.

		tar xvf /dev/nrst0

	If this extracts the sets directly into your current
	directory, terrific.  Otherwise, go to the directory in
	which they live.  Skip on to extracting the sets.

	If you will be grabbing the sets off of the network somehow,
	configure your network interface:

		ifconfig le0 inet <ipaddr> <netmask> <broadcast>
		route add default <addr-of-default-router>

	If you will be ftp'ing the sets from one of the NetBSD ftp
	sites, go to the directory where you wish to temporarily
	place them and download them from the ftp site of your choice.
	Since you haven't yet created a resolv.conf, you'll need to
	use the IP address.

		/ibin/ftp <ftp_ipaddr>

	If you will be getting the sets from an NFS server, mount
	the filesystem on the server which has the sets, and go
	to the directory that has them.  Again, you'll need to use
	the IP address of the server.

		mount -t nfs <serv_ipaddr>:<server_dir> <mount_point>

	At this point, you have everything necessary to label any
	additional disks that you wish to label.  If you created
	additional labels in the preparation phase, and have
	access to them now, go ahead and label the disks they
	correspond to:

		disklabel -W rd1
		disklabel -r -R rd1 rd1.label
	where:
		rd1		additional disk you wish to label
		rd1.label	file containing disk label information

	You may check these labels once they are on the disk:

		disklabel -r rd1
	where:
		rd1		additional disk you wish to label

	A problem with a partition (such as overlaps or not falling
	on a cylinder boundary) will be noted with a `*'.  If you see
	these, re-edit your label by the method of your choice (on
	another machine, perhaps, or with ed(1), for the brave),
	transfer it to a place that's usable (if necessary) and
	label the disk again.

	Once these disks have been labeled, you may newfs the
	partitions that are to contain filesystems and mount them.

	You should now be ready to extract the filesets.  The program
	/ibin/extract should help you with this.  For example:

		/ibin/extract base
	-or-	/ibin/extract base.tar.gz

	Do this for all of the filesets you wish to extract.  As your disk
	fills up, you may wish to remove the sets once you have extracted
	them.

	You should have everything necessary to use an editor by now.
	Set your TERM environment variable:

		setenv TERM hp300h	(csh)
	-or-	export TERM=hp300h	(sh)

	hp300h is the terminal type for the HP 9000/300 ITE console.
	If you are using a serial console, change the TERM variable
	appropriately.  Now, initialize the terminal:

		tset

	You should be able to use vi now.

	Create an /etc/fstab.  Example fstabs are provided in
	/etc/fstab.sd and /etc/fstab.rd.

	Edit your host table, /etc/hosts.  In it, place the IP
	address of this host and the IP address of your default
	router.

	Edit the file /etc/myname.  In it, place the symbolic name
	of your machine.

	Edit the file /etc/defaultdomain.  In it, place the name
	of your YP domain.  If you will not be using YP, simply
	enter the domain name of your site.

	Edit the file /etc/mygate.  In it, place the name of
	your default router, as your listed it in /etc/hosts.

	Edit the file /etc/hostname.le0.  In it, place the following
	information:

		inet <myname.my.domain> <netmask> <broadcast>

	where:
		<myname.my.domain> is the name corresponsing to
		the IP address for that interface, as you listed in
		/etc/hosts.

		<netmask> is the netmask for your network.

		<broadcast> is the broadcast address for your network.

	Repeat this step for any additional network interfaces you
	may have.

	Edit the file /etc/ttys.  Make sure that the entries are
	correct for whichever console type you have.  /dev/console
	is correct for ITE, /dev/tty0 for console on dca, and
	/dev/tty00 for console on dcm.  You may get more information
	about /etc/ttys by doing `man ttys', providing you have
	installed the system manual set.

	Ok, cross your fingers and reboot:

		sync; sync; sync; reboot

	Providing you entered all information correctly, your
	machine will boot into multi-user mode.  Your system
	will need a few tweaks here and there (like /etc/sendmail.cf
	and /etc/netstart, perhaps), but that's the easy stuff.

	CONGRATULATIONS!  You have successfully installed NetBSD
	onto your hp300!  Pat yourself on the back.  This might also
	be a good time to remove /ibin, as you will no longer need
	it, and it is provided solely for bootstrapping purposes.
