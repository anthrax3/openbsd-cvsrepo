@Retire hp300, mvme68k and mvme88k ports. These ports have no users, keeping
this hardware alive is becoming increasingly difficult, and I should heed the

Noone sane will mourn these ports anyway. So long, and thanks for the fish.

The OpenBSD/hp300 binary distribution sets contain the binaries which
comprise the OpenBSD 2.3 release for the hp300.  There are seven binary
distribution tar sets.  They may be found in the top of the "hp300"
subdirectory of the OpenBSD 2.3 distribution tree, and are as follows:

	base23	The OpenBSD/hp300 2.3 base binary distribution.  You
		MUST install this distribution set.  It contains the
		base OpenBSD utilities that are necessary for the
		system to run and be minimally functional.  It
		includes shared library support, and excludes
		everything described below.
		[ 11.2M gzipped, 34.0M uncompressed ]

	comp23	The OpenBSD/hp300 Compiler tools.  All of the tools
		relating to C and C++.  This set includes the system
		include files (/usr/include), the linker, the compiler
		tool chain, and the various system libraries (except
		the shared libraries, which are included as part of the
		base set).  This set also includes the manual pages for
		all of the utilities it contains, as well as the system
		call and library manual pages.
		[ 7.0M gzipped, 23.5M uncompressed ]

	etc23	This distribution set contains the system configuration
		files that reside in /etc and in several other places.
		This set MUST be installed if you are installing the
		system from scratch, but should NOT be used if you are
		upgrading.  (If you are upgrading, it's recommended that
		you get a copy of this set and CAREFULLY upgrade your
		configuration files by hand.)
		[ 94K gzipped, 500K uncompressed ]

	game23	This set includes the games and their manual pages.
		[ 2.7M gzipped, 6.7M uncompressed ]

	man23	This set includes all of the manual pages for the
		binaries and other software contained in the base set.
		Note that it does not include any of the manual pages
		that are included in the other sets.
		[ 2.5M gzipped, 9.2M uncompressed ]

	misc23	This set includes the system dictionaries (which are
		rather large), the typesettable document set, and
		man pages for other architectures which happen to be
		installed from the source tree by default.
		[ 1.7M gzipped, 5.8M uncompressed ]

	text23	This set includes OpenBSD's text processing tools,
		including groff, all related programs, and their
		manual pages.
		[ 947K gzipped, 3.5M uncompressed ]
d37 1
a37 2
	xbase23 This set includes the base X distribution.  This includes
		programs, headers, libraries, configuration files.

The instructions given for extracting the source sets work equally
well for the binary sets, but it is worth noting that if you use that
method, the files are extracted "below" the current directory.  That
is, if you want to extract the binaries "into" your system, i.e.
replace the system binaries with them, you have to run the "tar xvfp"
from /.  Also note that if you upgrade or install this way, those
programs that you are using at the time will NOT be replaced.  If you
follow the normal installation or upgrade procedures, this will be
taken care of for you.

in the "hp300/security" subdirectory of the OpenBSD 1.1 distribution
tree.  It contains executables which are built in the "src/domestic" portion
if the OpenBSD source tree.  It can only be found on those sites which carry
the complete OpenBSD distribution and that can legally obtain it.  (Remember,
because of United States law, this distribution set may not be exported to
locations outside of the United States and Canada.)
