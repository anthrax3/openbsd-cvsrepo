@Retire hp300, mvme68k and mvme88k ports. These ports have no users, keeping
this hardware alive is becoming increasingly difficult, and I should heed the
message sent by the three disks which have died on me over the last few days.

Noone sane will mourn these ports anyway. So long, and thanks for the fish.

OpenBSD/MACHINE OSREV will run on most HP 9000/300- and 400-series
machines.

12MB of RAM should be sufficient to boot and a minimal system can probably
be squeezed onto a 250MB disk by installing only the `base' and `etc' sets.
However, a minimum of 16MB is necessary for the system not to be swap-bound,
with 32MB or more being recommended for serious usage of the system.

The following HP hardware is supported:

    HP 9000/300 series

	68030-based:  340, 345, 360, 362, 370 and 375.
	68040-based:  380, 382 and 385.

    HP 9000/400 series

	68030-based:  400(dl/s/t).
	68040-based:  425(dl/e/s/t) and 433(dl/s/t).

	These machines are not supported when configured for Domain/OS;
	their ROMs need to be configured in `HP-UX mode'.

    SCSI controllers and peripherals

	98658A built-in and add-on SCSI interface (spc).

	SCSI-1 disk drives (sd), cdrom drives (cd), tape drives (st)
	and tape changers (ch).

	SCSI-2 devices are known to work, but may require changing a jumper
	to restrict them to SCSI-1 behaviour.

    HP-IB/CS80 controller and peripherals

	98624 built-in HP-IB interface (nhpib).
	98625A and 98625B `fast' HP-IB interface (fhpib).

	Most HP disks, including: 7912, 7914, 7933, 7936, 7937,
	7945, 7957, 7958, 7959, 2200, and 2203.

	Low-density cartridge drives: 7914, 7946, and 9144.
	High-density cartridge drives: 9145.
	1/2" tape drives: 7974A, 7978A/B, 7979A, 7980A, and 7980XC.

    Serial ports

	98644 built-in and add-on single port (dca).
	98642 4-port (dcm).
	98638 8-port (dcm).
	400-series Apollo 3-port serial/keyboard mux (apci).
		[The first port being typically configured as a dca device,
		 except on the 425e.]

    Ethernet interfaces

	98643 built-in and add-on LAN cards (le).

    Frame buffers

	98543, 98544, 98545 and 98547 color and monochrome Topcat (topcat).
	98548, 98549 and 98550 color and monochrome Catseye (topcat).
	A1416A color Kathmandu (topcat).
	98700 and 98710 Gatorbox (gbox).
	98720 and 98721 Renaissance (rbox).
	98730 and 98731 DaVinci (dvbox).
	A1096A monochrome Hyperion (hyper).
	98705 ``Tigershark'' PersonalVRX (tvrx).
	VRX (362/382 on-board), EVRX (425e on-board) and other SGC
	    frame buffers (sti).

    Input devices

	General interface supporting all HIL devices (hil):
		keyboard (hilkbd)
		2 and 3 button mice(hilms)
		ID module (hilid)
		[Serial mice connected to a `HIL to quad' converter are
		 also known to work]

	Apollo domain keyboards and mice (on 400 series) (dnkbd).

    Miscellaneous

	Digital audio on model 425e (arcofi)
	Battery-backed real-time clock (except on 425e).
	Printers and plotters on RS232 and HP-IB (ppi).

To actually do much compiling or anything more interesting than
booting, more RAM and disk space is highly recommended. About 250MB will be
necessary to install all of the OpenBSD OSREV binary distribution (note that
this does not count swap space!).  Much more disk space is required to
install the source and objects as well (about another 600MB).

The lowest amount of RAM that has ever been tested is 7.5M, though it

Here is a table of recommended HD partition sizes for a full install:
	partition:	advise		needed
	root (/)	15M		10M
	user (/usr)	80M		45M
	swap		(2 or 3 * RAM)	 6M	(see note below)
	Anything else is up to you!

NOTE:  The hp300 installation procedure utilizes a `miniroot' filesystem
which is placed into the swap area of the disk.  The swap are must be
at least large enough to hold this miniroot image.

NOTE:  Because of the nature of the hp300 bootstrap procedure, the root
filesystem is a _fixed_size_!  You may want to consider placing /var and
/tmp on their own partitions.  This, of course is up to you and your
judgement.  Also, note that the recommended size of /usr is 15M greater
than the needed size.  This is to allow room for kernel source and
compile areas, as you may want to compile your own kernel.
