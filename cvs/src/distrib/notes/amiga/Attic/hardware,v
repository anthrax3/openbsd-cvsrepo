OpenBSD/MACHINE OSREV runs on any amiga that has a 68020, 68030, 68040 or
68060 CPU with some form of FPU and MMU.  It should also run on
MacroSystem's DraCo computer.
6MB of RAM should be sufficient to boot and a minimal system can probably
be squeezed onto a 100MB partition by installing just the minimum sets.
To actually do much compiling or anything more interesting than
booting, more RAM and disk space is highly recommended. About 250MB will be
necessary to install all of the OpenBSD OSREV binary distribution (note that
this does not count swap space!).  Much more disk space is required to
install the source and objects as well (about another 600MB).
An AmigaDOS partition is also required to install OpenBSD/MACHINE OSREV and
boot it, see below.

Supported devices {:-include-:}:
	A4000/A1200 IDE controller.
	ISA IDE & ATAPI with a supported ISA bridge.
		[Note: With single ATAPI device IDE busses, the
		ATAPI device should be set to SLAVE.]
	SCSI host adapters:
		33c93 based boards: A2091, A3000 and GVP series II.
		53c80 based boards: 12 Gauge, IVS, Emplant and
				    Wordsync/Bytesync.
		53c710 based boards: A4091, Magnum, Warp Engine, Zeus
				     and DraCo.
		FAS216 based boards: FastLane Z3, Blizzard.
	Video controllers:
		ECS, AGA and A2024 built in on various amigas
		Retina Z2 and Retina Z3.
		Picasso II.
		GVP Spectrum.
		Piccolo.
		A2410.
		Cybervision 64. (Not Cybervision 64/3D)
		oMnibus.
		Domino.
		Merlin.
	Ethernet controllers:
		A2065.
		Hydra.
		ASDG.
		A4066.
		Ariadne (currently broken).
		AriadneII.
		Quicknet.
		Via a supported ISA bridge:
			NE[12]000, SMC/WD 8003/8013/8216 and 3COM 3c503.
		
	Arcnet controllers:
		A2060.
	Tape drives:
		Most SCSI tape drives.
	CD-ROM drives:
		Most SCSI CD-ROM drives.
	Serial ports:
		Amiga serial port.
		DraCo serial port.
		MultiFaceCard II and III.
		A2232.
		PC COM ports attached to a supported ISA bridge.
	Parallel ports:
		Amiga parallel port.
		PC LPT ports attached to a supported ISA bridge.
	ISA bridges:
		The GoldenGate Bus+ (aka GG2).
		The CrossLink.
	Amiga floppy drives.
	Amiga mouse.
	Amiga joystick.

If it's not on this list, there is no support for it in this release.

MacroSystem's DraCo computer.  The minimal configuration requires 4M of
RAM and about 55M of disk space.  To install the entire system requires
much more disk space, and to run X or compile the system, more RAM is
recommended.  (4M of RAM will actually allow you to compile, however it
won't be speedy.  X really isn't usable on a 4M system.)

Here is a table of recommended HD partition sizes for a full install:
	partition:	advise,	with X,	needed,	with X
	root (/)	 30M	 30M	25M	 25M
	user (/usr)	210M    245M   140M     175M
	/usr/local      depends on what extra software you want
	swap		---- 1MB for every MB RAM ----
			-- but the sum of swap and ---
			- RAM should be at least 16 --

As you may note the recommended size of /usr is 70M greater than
needed. This is to leave room for a kernel source and compile tree
as you will probably want to compile your own kernel. (GENERIC is
large and bulky to accommodate all people).

Starting with OpenBSD 2.7, you should be able to leave /usr mounted
readonly on production machines, and use a separate /usr/local
partition for packages.


If you only have 4M of fast memory, you should make your swap partition
larger, as your system will be doing much more swapping.
