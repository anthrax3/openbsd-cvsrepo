OpenBSDInstallPrelude

OpenBSDInstallPart2

	If you have a small machine (less than 6MB of fast RAM) you'll
	have to setup a miniroot filesystem in the swap partition, as
	described in the "Preparing your System for OpenBSD Installation"
	section above.  If your machine has 6MB or more we strongly
	recommend using the ramdisk kernel instead.  This way you don't
	need to setup any root image beforehand.

	You need to have the "loadbsd" program in your command path.
	If AmigaDOS complains about loadbsd not being an executable file,
	be sure that the "Execute" protection bit is set.  If not, set it
	with the command:
		Protect loadbsd add e

	Next you need to get yourself into OpenBSD by loading the
	kernel from AmigaDOS with loadbsd like so:

		loadbsd bsd.rd

	or, if you are doing a miniroot install:

		loadbsd -b bsd


	If you have an AGA machine, and your monitor will handle
	the dblNTSC mode, you may also {:-include-:} the "-A" option to
	enable the dblNTSC display mode.

OpenBSDBootMsgs

	If you are doing the miniroot install you will be prompted for a
	root device.  The name of your root disk is typically "sd0" for
	SCSI drives or the A4000 IDE drives or "wd0" for ISA-connected IDE
	drives.  Reply with the name of your disk, such as "sd0*", where
	"0" is the device which holds the miniroot-containing swap
	partition you created during the hard disk preparation.  If the
	system should hang after entering the root device, try again with

		loadbsd -I ff -b bsd

	This disables synchronous transfer on all SCSI devices.  For
	ramdisk installations this kind of hang might occur later during
	the install when accessing the SCSI disk for the first time.  If
	such a hang occurs, try again with:

		loadbsd -I ff bsd.rd

	You will be asked which terminal type to use, you should just
	hit return to select the default (vt220).

	The install program will then tell you which disks of that
	type it can install on, and ask you which it should use.  Reply
	with the name of your disk ("sd0" or "wd0").

	The install program will now ask which file systems should be
	created on which partitions.  It will automatically select the
	'a' partition to be the root file system. Next it will ask for
	which disk and partition you want a file system created on.
	This will be the same as the disk name (e.g. "sd0") with the
	letter identifying the partition (e.g. "d") appended (e.g.
	"sd0d").  Then it will ask where this partition is to be
	mounted, e.g. /usr.  This process will be repeated until you
	just hit return.

	At this point you will be asked to confirm that the file system
	information you have entered is correct, and given an opportunity
	to change the file system table.  Next it will create the new file
	systems as specified, OVERWRITING ANY EXISTING DATA.  This is the
	point of no return.

	The install program will now make the filesystems you specified.
	There should be only one error in this section of the installation.
	It will look like this:

		newfs: ioctl (WDINFO): Invalid argument
		newfs: /dev/rsd0a: can't rewrite disk label

	If there are any others, restart from the beginning of
	the installation process.  This error is ok as the Amiga
	does not write disklabels currently.  You should expect
	this error whenever using newfs.

@Since the installation procedure will list all the supported media flags
via ifconfig -m, there is no need to suggest canonical media flags on
some arches, especially since the end user might have a different
interface with different flags; instead, be more cosy and mention that
looking at the manual page for the interface might be helpful for
desperate cases.

Thus, merge the OpenBSDInstallNet and OpenBSDInstallNet2 macros, and
remove thde in-between text for the arches that had such a paragraph.

	After all your file systems have been created, the install program
	will give you an opportunity to configure the network.  The network
	configuration you enter (if any) can then be used to do the install
	from another system using NFS, HTTP or FTP, and will also be the
	configuration used by the system after the installation is complete.

	If you select to configure the network, the install program will
	ask you for a name of your system and the DNS domain name to use.
	Note that the host name should be without the domain part, and that
	the domain name should NOT {:-include-:} the host name part.

	Next the system will give you a list of network interfaces you can
	configure.  For each network interface you select to configure, it
	will ask for the IP address to use, the symbolic host name to use,
	the netmask to use and any interface-specific flags to set.  The
	interface-specific flags are usually used to determine which media
	the network card is to use.  The flags usually carry the following

	After all network interfaces have been configured the install pro-
	gram will ask for a default route and IP address of the primary

	At this point you will be allowed to edit the file system table
	that will be used for the remainder of the installation and that
	will be used by the finished system, following which the new file
	systems will be mounted to complete the installation.

	After these preparatory steps have been completed, you will be
	able to extract the distribution sets onto your system.  There
	are several install methods supported; FTP, HTTP, tape, CD-ROM, NFS
	or a local disk partition.  Note that installation from floppies
	is not currently supported.

Installing OpenBSD is a relatively complex process, but, if you have
this document in hand and are careful to read and remember the
information which is presented to you by the install program, it
shouldn't be too much trouble.

Before you begin, you must have already prepared your hard disk as
detailed in the section on preparing your system for install.

The following is a walk-through of the steps necessary to get OpenBSD
installed on your hard disk.  If you wish to stop the installation,
you may hit Control-C at any prompt, but if you do, you'll have to
begin again from scratch.

	To install via FTP:
		To begin an FTP install you will need the following
		pieces of information.  Don't be daunted by this list;
		the defaults are sufficient for most people.
		    1) Proxy server URL if you are using a URL-based
		       ftp proxy (squid, CERN ftp, Apache 1.2 or higher).
		       You need to define a proxy if you are behind a
		       firewall that blocks outgoing ftp (assuming you
		       have a proxy available to use).
		    2) Do you need to use passive mode ftp?  Most modern
		       ftp servers are capable of dealing with passive
		       ftp connections.  You only need to enable this
		       option if you are behind a firewall that allows
		       outgoing ftp but blocks incoming tcp ports > 1023.
		       If in doubt say yes to this option.
		       Note that you will not be asked about passive
		       ftp if you are using a proxy.
		    3) The IP address (or hostname if you enabled
		       DNS earlier in the install) of an ftp server
		       carrying the OpenBSD 2.3 distribution.
		       If you don't know, just hit return when
		       asked if you want to see a list of such hosts.
		    4) The ftp directory holding the distribution sets.
		       The default value of pub/OpenBSD/2.3/amiga
		       is almost always correct.
		    5) The login and password for the ftp account.
		       The default will be correct unless you are
		       doing non-anonymous ftp.

		For instructions on how to complete the installation via
		ftp, see the section named "Common URL installations" below.

	To install via HTTP:
		To begin an HTTP install you will need the following
		pieces of information:
		    1) Proxy server URL if you are using a URL-based
		       http proxy (squid, CERN ftp, Apache 1.2 or higher).
		       You need to define a proxy if you are behind a
		       firewall that blocks outgoing http connections
		       (assuming you have a proxy available to use).
		    3) The IP address (or hostname if you enabled
		       DNS earlier in the install) of an http server
		       carrying the OpenBSD 2.3 distribution.
		       If you don't know, just hit return when
		       asked if you want to see a list of such hosts.
		    4) The directory holding the distribution sets.
		       There is no standard location for this;
		       You should use the directory specified
		       along with the server in the list of official
		       http mirror sites that you received in step 3.

		For instructions on how to complete the installation via
		http, see the section named "Common URL installations" below.

	To install from tape:
		In order to install from tape, the distribution sets to be
		installed must have been written to tape previously, either
		in tar format or gzip-compressed tar format.

		You will also have to identify the tape device where the
		distribution sets are to be extracted from.  This will
		typically be "nrst0" (no-rewind, raw interface).

		Next you will have to provide the file number of the set
		that is to be extracted.  Note that the file number starts
		at 1, which is the first file written to the tape.

		The install program will not automatically detect whether
		an image has been compressed, so it will ask for that
		information before starting the extraction.

	To install from CD-ROM:
		When installing from a CD-ROM, you will be asked which
		device holds the distribution sets.  This will typically
		be either "cd0" or "acd0".  Next you will be asked which
		partition on the CD-ROM the distribution is to be loaded
		from.  This is normally partition "a".

		Next you will have to identify the file system type that
		has been used to create the distribution on the CD-ROM,
		this can be either FFS or ISO CD9660.  The OpenBSD CD
		distribution uses the CD9660 format.

		You will also have to provide the relative path to the
		directory on the CD which holds the distribution, for the
		amiga this is "2.3/amiga".

		For instructions on how to complete the installation from
		the CD-ROM distribution, see the section named "Common
		file system installations" below.
d150 1
a150 40
	To install from a NFS mounted directory:
		When installing from a NFS-mounted directory, you must
		have completed network configuration above, and also
		set up the exported file system on the NFS server in
		advance.

		First you must identify the IP address of the NFS server
		to load the distribution from, and the file system the
		server expects you to mount.

		The install program will also ask whether or not TCP
		should be used for transport (the default is UDP).  Note
		that TCP only works with newer NFS servers.

		You will also have to provide the relative path to the
		directory on the file system where the distribution sets
		are located.  Note that this path should not be prefixed
		with a '/'.

		For instructions on how to complete the installation from
		the CD-ROM distribution, see the section named "Common
		file system installations" below.

	To install from a local disk partition:
		When installing from a local disk partition, you will
		first have to identify which disk holds the distribution
		sets.  This is normally "sdN" or "wdN" where N is a
		number 0 through 9.  Next you will have to identify the
		partition within that disk that holds the distribution,
		this is a single letter between 'a' and 'p'.

		You will also have to identify the type of file system
		residing in the partition identified.  Currently you can
		install from partitions that has been formatted as
		Berkeley fast file system (ffs) or AmigaDOS FFS (ados).

		You will also have to provide the relative path to the
		directory on the file system where the distribution sets
		are located.  Note that this path should not be prefixed
		with a '/'.
d152 3
a154 68
		For instructions on how to complete the installation from
		the a local disk partition, see the next section.
		
	Common file system installations:
		The following instructions are common to installations
		from local disk partitions, NFS mounted directories and
		CD-ROMs.

		A list of available distribution sets will be listed.  If
		any sets has already been extracted, those will be marked
		with an X.  Enter the name of one distribution set at a
		time, until all desired distribution sets has been
		installed on your system.

	Common URL installations:
		Once you have entered the required information, the
		install program will fetch a file list and present
		a list of all the distribution sets that were found
		in the specified directory.  (If no valid sets were found,
		you will be notified and given the option of unpacking
		any gzipped tar files found or getting a file list if
		none were found.)

		At this point you may individually select distribution
		sets to install or enter "all" to install all of
		the sets (which is what most users will want to do).
		You may also enter "list" to get a file list or
		"done" when you are done selecting distribution sets.
		(It is also possible to enter an arbitrary filename
		and have it treated as a file set).

		Once you have selected the file sets you want to install
		and entered "done" you will be prompted to verify that
		you really do want to download and install the files.
		Assuming you acquiesce, the files will begin to download
		and unpack.  If not, you will be given the option of
		installing sets via one of the other install methods.


	When all the selected distribution sets has been extracted, you
	will be allowed to select which time zone your system will be
	using, all the device nodes needed by the installed system will
	be created for you and the file systems will be unmounted.  For
	this to work properly, it is expected that you have installed
	at least the "base23" and "etc23" distribution sets.


Congratulations, you have successfully installed OpenBSD 2.3.  When you
reboot into OpenBSD, you should log in as "root" at the login prompt.
There is no initial password, but if you're using the machine in a
networked environment, you should create yourself an account and
protect it and the "root" account with good passwords.  You should have
got a mail from the install program we recommend you to read.  This you
can do by running

	mail

and then just enter "1" to get at the first mail.  You quit mail by
entering "q".

Some of the files in the OpenBSD 2.3 distribution will need to be
tailored for your site.  We recommend you run:

	man afterboot

which will tell you about a bunch of the files needing to be reviewed.
If you are unfamiliar with UN*X-like system administration, it's
recommended that you buy a book that discusses it.

probably need to be modified, as well.  If you are unfamiliar with
UN*X-like system administration, it's recommended that you buy a book
that discusses it.

	Transfer the install miniroot filesystem onto the hard disk
	partition used by OpenBSD for swapping, as described in the
	"Preparing your System for OpenBSD Installation" section above.

	hard disk device(s) are configured (sd0, sd1, etc).  Then
	you will be prompted for a root device.  At this time type
	'sd0*', where '0' is the device which contains the swap
	partition you created during the hard disk preparation.

	If the system should hang after entering the root device, try
	again with
d56 41
a96 29
	This disables synchronous transfer on all SCSI devices.

	The system should continue to boot.  For now ignore WARNING:
	messages about bad dates in clocks.  Eventually you will be
	asked to enter the pathname of the shell, just hit return.
	After a short while you should see a welcome message and a
	prompt, asking if you wish to proceed with the installation.

	If you wish to proceed, enter "y" and then return.

	If you have configured your hard drive[s] correctly it
	should find the drive and partition that you selected to
	use as your root.  You will be prompted for which device
	you want to use for your root.  If you have multiple disks
	present with root partitions defined, you will need to be
	sure you enter the device name of the correct partition you
	want to install OpenBSD on.

	YOU ARE NOW AT THE POINT OF NO RETURN.  If you confirm that
	you want to install OpenBSD, your hard drive will be modified,
	and perhaps its contents scrambled at the whim of the install
	program.

	If you are sure you want to proceed, enter "yes" at the
	prompt.

	The install program will now make the root filesystem you
	specified.  There should be only one error in this section
	of the installation.  It will look like so:
d106 95
a200 63
	Next the install program will ask you which drive and
	partition you wish to use as /usr.  First it will list the
	available drives.  Choose one.  Next it will give you a
	list of the partitions on that disk along with their sizes,
	types, etc..  Choose the letter that corresponds to the
	partition you wish to use for /usr.  If you are doing a
	full install this should be at the very least 45M-50M large.
	If everything is ok the install program will then format
	and mount your /usr.  If not then it will ask again for a
	drive and partition.

	When this completes your root partition will be mounted on
	/mnt and your /usr partition on /mnt/usr.  An fstab will
	have been created and initialized to correctly mount these
	two file systems.  This fstab will be in /mnt/etc.

	What you do from this point on depends on which media you're
	using to install OpenBSD.  Follow the appropriate instructions,
	given below.

	To install from an AmigaDOS partition:

		You first need to mount the AmigaDOS partition
		using the mount_ados command.  If e.g. your AmigaDOS
		partition is the first partition on sd0 you could
		type:
			
			mkdir /mnt/ados
			mount_ados -o ro /dev/sd0d /mnt/ados

		You can use `disklabel sd0' to find out what types
		of partitions are on the disk `sd0'.

		Next goto the directory in which you stored the
		distribution sets.  If e.g. you stored them in the
		root directory of the partition:

			cd /mnt/ados

		When there, run "Set_tmp_dir" and choose the default
		temporary directory, by hitting return at the
		prompt.

		Run the "Extract" command, giving it as its sole
		argument the name of the distribution set you wish
		to extract.  For example, to extract the base
		distribution, use the command:

			Extract base21

		and to extract the games distribution:

			Extract game21

		If the distribution sets are in different directories,
		you will need to cd to each directory in turn, runing
		"Set_tmp_dir" and the appropriate "Extract" command(s).

		Continue this process until you've finished installing
		all of the sets which you desire to have on your
		hard disk.  Once you have extracted all sets and
		are at the "#" prompt again, proceed to the section
		"Configuring Your System," below.
d203 76
d280 2
a281 67
		The first thing you should do is pick a temporary
		directory where the distribution files can be stored.
		To do this, use the command "Set_tmp_dir" and enter
		your choice.  The default is /mnt/usr/distrib.

		After you have picked a temporary directory,
		you should issue the load command:

			Load_tape

		Next, you will be told to insert the media into
		the appropriate drive, and hit return.  Continue
		to follow instructions until you are returned to
		the "#" prompt.

		Go to the directory which contains the first
		distribution set you wish to install.  This is
		either the directory you specified above, or possibly
		a subdirectory of that directory.

		When there, run "Set_tmp_dir" again, and choose
		the default temporary directory, by hitting
		return at the prompt.

		Run the "Extract" command, giving it as its sole
		argument the name of the distribution set you
		wish to extract.  For example, to extract the base
		distribution, use the command:

			Extract base21

		and to extract the games distribution:

			Extract game21

		After the extraction is complete, go to the location
		of the next set you want to extract, "Set_tmp_dir"
		again, and once again issue the appropriate
		extract command.  Continue this process until
		you've finished installing all of the sets which you
		desire to have on your hard disk.

		After each set is finished, if you know that you
		are running low on space you can remove the
		distribution files for that set by saying:

			rm set_name.??

		For example, if you wish to remove the distribution
		files for the game21 set, after the "Extract game21"
		command has completed, issue the command:

			rm game21.??

		Once you have extracted all sets and are at the "#" prompt
		again, proceed to the section "Configuring Your System,"
		below.

	To install via FTP or NFS:

		First, use Set_tmp_dir to pick a temporary directory
		for the installation files.  /mnt/usr/distrib is
		suggested.

		Configure the appropriate ethernet interface i.e. le0
		if you have a 2065 or ed0 if you have a AMIGNET from
		Hydra Systems.
d283 56
a338 122
			ifconfig <ifname> <ipaddr> [netmask <netmask>]

		where <ifname> is the interface name (e.g. ed0, etc.),
		and <ipaddr> is the numeric IP address of the interface.
		If the interface has a special netmask, supply
		the word "netmask" and that netmask at the end of the
		command line.  For instance, without a special netmask:

			ifconfig ed0 129.133.10.10

		or with a special netmask

			ifconfig ed0 128.32.240.167 netmask 0xffffff00

		You should also be able to use SLIP or PPP as the network
		connection.
		[XXX instructions for ppp or slip would be usefull
		perhaps the next release]

		If the NFS server or FTP server is not on a directly-
		connected network, you should set up a route to it
		with the command:

			route add default <gate_ipaddr>

		where <gate_ipaddr> is your gateway's numeric IP address.

		If you are NFS-mounting the distribution sets,
		mount them on the temporary directory with the command:

			mount -t nfs <serv_ipaddr>:<dist_dir> <tmp_dir>

		where <serv_ipaddr> is the server's numeric IP address,
		<dist_dir> is the path to the distribution files on
		the server, and <tmp_dir> is the name of the local
		temporary directory.

		Once this is done, proceed as if you had loaded the
		files from tape, "cd"ing to the appropriate directories
		and running "Set_tmp_dir" and "Extract" as appropriate.

		If you are retrieving the distribution sets using ftp,
		cd into the temp directory, and execute the command:

			ftp <serv_ipaddr>

		where <serv_ipaddr> is once again the server's
		numeric IP address.  Get the files with FTP,
		taking care to use binary mode to transfer
		all files.

		Once you have all of the files for the distribution sets
		you wish to install, you can proceed using the instructions
		above as if you had installed the files from a tape.


Configuring Your System:
----------- ---- ------

Once you have finished extracting all of the distribution sets that
you want on your hard drive and are back at the "#" prompt,
you are ready to configure your system.

The configuration utility expects that you have installed the base
system.  If you have not, you will not be able to run it successfully
(nor will you have a functional system regardless of configuration).

To configure the newly installed operating system, run the
command "Configure".

Configure will ask for the machine's hostname, domain name, and other
network configuration information.

Once you have supplied `Configure' all that it requests, your machine
will be configured well enough that when you reboot it it will
almost be a completely functional OpenBSD system.

>>> Copy the kernel from the miniroot filesystem at this point <<<

Once you are done with `Configure', halt the system with the "halt"
command (wait for "halted" to be displayed) and reboot.  Then again
boot OpenBSD this time with the command:


	loadbsd bsd

You need to do your final tweeks now.  First mount your file systems
like so:

	mount -av

Your system is now complete but not completely configured; you
should adjust the /etc/sendmail.cf file as necessary to suit your
site and/or disable sendmail and other network related programs.
These things can be found in /etc/netstart.  Use vi, if you installed
the man pages you can type `man vi' or `man ed' for instructions
on how to use these somewhat non-intuitive editors.

You should also put a copy of the bsd kernel in your root partition.
This can be done easily by mounting the AmigaDOS partition containing
the kernel you used to start OpenBSD and copying the "bsd" file to
the root:
	mount -r -t ados /dev/sd0d /mnt
	cp /mnt/bsd /
(where /dev/sd0d is the AmigaDOS partition where you have bsd, and
/mnt/bsd is the appropriate path of the bsd file).

Once you are done with the rest of configuration unmount your file
systems and halt your system, then reboot:

	cd /
	umount -av
	halt
	<reboot>

Finally you can now boot your system and it will be completely
functional:

	loadbsd -a bsd

When it boots off of the hard drive, you will have a complete
OpenBSD system!  CONGRATULATIONS! (You really deserve them!!!)
