The directory '../OSREV/MACHINE/utils' contains the OpenBSD/MACHINE boot
program, used to load the OpenBSD kernel. This program is distributed
as a self-extracting archive in Macintosh BinHex format. If there is no
BSD/Mac68k booter already installed on your Mac OS system, you will need to
download this file.

The directory '../OSREV/MACHINE/utils' contains a number of utilities for the
Mac OS to aid the installation and configuration of OpenBSD.  The files are
distributed in Macintosh BinHex format, which is used to make SEA (Self-
Extracting Archive) files, which are then used to make the executables.  The
files in this directory are as follows:

	Booter1.11.3.sea.hqx
		 This Mac OS program is used to load the OpenBSD kernel and
		 start the operating system.  In all cases, you will need to
		 download this file.

	Installer_1.2.sea.hqx
		 This is the Mac OS program used to install downloaded sets
		 (such as those from the bins directory) onto a BSD partition.
		 It is necessary in either the case of a fresh install or an
		 upgrade.

	Mkfs_1.45.sea.hqx
		 A Mac OS program to build BSD filesystems on various
		 partitions you have created (see below).  You will need this
		 if you are performing a new installation.

d10 1
a10 5
The OpenBSD/mac68k binary distribution sets contain all the binaries which
comprise the OpenBSD 2.3 release for the mac68k.  There are seven binary
distribution sets.  The binary distribution sets can be found in
the "mac68k" subdirectory of the OpenBSD 2.3 distribution tree,
and are as follows:
d12 1
a12 1
	bsd-generic.tar.gz	The OpenBSD/mac68k 2.3 kernel binary.  
d25 1
a25 56
	base23.tar.gz	The OpenBSD/mac68k 2.3 base binary distribution.
		You MUST install this distribution set.  It contains 
		the base OpenBSD utilities that are necessary for the
		system to run and be minimally functional.  It
		includes shared library support, and excludes
		everything described below.
		[ 11.9M gzipped, 33.7M uncompressed ]

	comp23.tar.gz	The OpenBSD/mac68k Compiler tools.  All of the tools
		relating to C, C++, and FORTRAN (yes, there are two!).
		This set includes the system header files
		(/usr/include), the linker, the compiler tool chain,
		and the various system libraries (except the shared
		libraries, which are included as part of the base
		set).  This set also includes the manual pages for all
		of the utilities it contains, as well as the system
		call and library manual pages.  It is very almost a must
		to install this set if one wants an even minimally
		functional system.
		[ 7.0M gzipped, 23.5M uncompressed ]

	etc23.tar.gz	This distribution set contains the system
		configuration files that reside in /etc and in several
		other places.  This set MUST be installed if you are
		installing the system from scratch, but should NOT be
		used if you are upgrading.  (If you are upgrading,
		it's recommended that you get a copy of this set and
		CAREFULLY upgrade your configuration files by hand.)
		[ 93K gzipped, 490K uncompressed ]

	game23.tar.gz	This set includes the BSD games and their manual
		pages.  It's installation is optional.
		[ 2.7M gzipped, 6.7M uncompressed ]

	man23.tar.gz	This set includes all of the manual pages for the
		binaries and other software contained in the base set.
		Note that it does not include any of the manual pages
		that are included in the other sets.  Installation of
		this set is completely optional but is highly recommended.
		[ 2.4M gzipped, 9.1M uncompressed ]

	misc23.tar.gz	This set includes the system dictionaries (which
		are rather large), the typesettable document set, and
		man pages for other architectures which happen to be
		installed from the source tree by default as well as
		many other sundry system files and programs.  This set
		is not necessary but will improve the functionality
		of many system programs.
		[ 1.7M gzipped, 5.9M uncompressed ]

	text23.tar.gz	This set includes OpenBSD's text processing tools,
		including groff, all related programs, and their
		manual pages.  This set is highly recommended as
		these programs are depended upon for such basic 
		system functions as reading manual pages.
		[ 946K gzipped, 3.5M uncompressed ]
d27 1
a27 2
	xbase23 This set includes the base X distribution.  This includes
		programs, headers, libraries, configuration files.

The mac68k binary distribution sets are distributed in the same form as
the source distribution sets; that is, the members of a set
form a gzipped tar file which is assumed to be relative to the root
of a system's directory tree.  In other words, all sets files should be
extracted from '/'.  The instructions given for extracting the source sets
work equally well for the binary sets.

the source distribution sets; catted together, the members of a set
form a gzipped tar file.

The instructions given for extracting the source sets work equally
well for the binary sets, but it is worth noting that if you use that
method, the files are extracted "below" the current directory.  That
is, if you want to extract the binaries "into" your system, i.e.
replace the system binaries with them, you have to run the "tar xfp"
from /.  Also note that if you upgrade or install this way, those
programs that you are using at the time will NOT be replaced.  If you
follow the normal installation or upgrade procedures, this will be
taken care of for you.
