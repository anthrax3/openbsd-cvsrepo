If your machine only has one SCSI disk, you will need to share the disk
with Mac OS.  You might have to repartition and/or reinstall Mac OS in
order to make room available for OpenBSD.

Find your favorite disk partitioning utility.  Some of the ones that have
been tried and seem to work are:
	APS Powertools 2.7.3
	SCSI Directory Lite
	Disk Manager Mac from OnTrack
	HD SC Setup from Apple
	I/O Formatter from Diversified (?)
	Silverlining from LaCie

"HD SC Setup" is included with the supported versions of Mac OS.
This utility ignores non-Apple hard disks unless you patch it with the
application found at the following URL:
  http://www.euronet.nl/users/ernstoud/hdpatch.html
Alternatively, one might prefer to use the A/UX version which does not
have such a restriction, and can be found at the following URL:
  http://www.euronet.nl/users/ernstoud/hdsetup.html

Prior to attempting to repartition your disk, everything of value on the
drive should be backed up.  All information on the drive you will be
repartitioning will be lost.

That done, use your favorite partitioning utility and make any necessary
Mac OS partitions, then restore your data.

You might want to create your OpenBSD partitions at this time, rather than
with the "pdisk" utility during the installation itself. In this case,
create one "A/UX Root" partition (for the / filesystem), one "Swap"
partition (for swap, obviously), and as many "Usr file system" or
"Unreserved" partitions as you want (for the other filesystems, such as
/tmp, /usr, /var, etc).

You will also need to install the BSD/Mac68k Booter on your Mac OS
system. It is available in the utils/ subdirectory of the distribution,
in self-extracting and binhex form as booter.sea.hqx.
Extract it as you would for any other Macintosh application.

Before moving on, you should make sure that your machine is running the
correct software on the Mac OS side.  In the Memory control panel, you
should turn Virtual Memory off whenever you are planning to use the
BSD/Mac68k Booter.

You should also make sure that your machine is using 32-bit addressing.
If there is no "Addressing:" option in your Memory control panel and your
machine is supported, you will probably need Mode32.  Mode32 is a control
panel and extension combination which enables 32-bit addressing on older
Macs which do not use it by default.  This program is available from any
Info-Mac mirror.

All of that done and accounted for, you are now set to install OpenBSD on
your hard drive.

** First, be sure you have a reliable backup of any data
** which you may want to keep.  All information on the hard
** drive you will be repartitioning will be lost.

That done, use your favorite partitioning utility to make
at least one A/UX "Root & Usr" partition and an A/UX "Swap"
partition.  The "Root & Usr" partition should be _at least_
250MB in size if you wish to install all the sets.  This partition
will be the root partition of your OpenBSD system.

Generally, you should allocate twice as much swap space as you have real
memory (so, if you have 16MB of RAM, specify 32MB of swap space).
Systems that will be heavily used or that are low on real
memory should have more swap space allocated.  Systems that
will be only lightly used can get away with less.

If you like, you can also create a smaller root partition
and a larger /usr.  If you plan to use this machine as a
server, you may also want a separate /var.  Create these
partitions as the BSD "usr" or "User slice X" type.

It is also possible to use the Mkfs utility to "convert" partitions from
Mac OS partitions to BSD partitions.  Mkfs will be discussed in more detail
later, but it is also very possible to simply prepare your hard drive by
partitioning it with Mac OS partitions of the correct size.  If you do this,
simply select the "Convert" button when choosing partitions to build a
filesystem on in Mkfs (see below).

Before moving on, you should make sure that your machine is running the correct
software on the Mac OS side.  In the Memory control panel, you should turn
Virtual Memory off whenever you are planning to use the BSD/Mac68k Booter.
You should also make sure that your machine is using 32-bit addressing.  If
there is no "Addressing:" option in your Memory control panel and your

panel and extension combination which enables 32-bit addressing on older Macs
which do not use it by default.  This program is available from any Info-Mac
mirror.  Finally, we recommend strongly that, at least for the purposes of
setting the system up, you run with the machine's monitor in 1-bit ("Black
and White" in the monitor's control panel) mode.
