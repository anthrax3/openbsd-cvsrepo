@Jumbo commit for 4.7 installation instructions:
- do not mention tape as an installation media on systems where it is very
  unlikely that a tape drive can be connected to (i.e. anything with only
  USB as expansion capabilities)
- do not mention that fetching the installation sets from a partition is
  ``for upgrades only''. You may do this for installation, but of course
  you can not use a partition which will be newfs'ed for that purpose.
- mention ext2fs partitions as possible installation sets source only on
  platforms where the installation media actually can mount an ext2fs
  filesystem.
- stress the fact that the sparc miniroot image is a GENERIC kernel with
  a little on-disk filesystem, and not a RAMDISK kernel with a little
  in-memory filesystem, and thus must not be overwritten during installation
  (i.e. be careful if you repartition the disk the miniroot has been put on).
- more conv=sync -> conv=osync for tape setup instructions.
- model-specific layout changes on armish, loongson and socppc instructions.
- fix various typos and grammar mistaeks.

Installation is really only supported from the local Macintosh hard drive or
from an AppleShare volume.  This means that you'll need at least enough room
on the HFS partition or AppleShare volume for the largest file that you will
have to install.

Extract them as you would any other Macintosh applications.  The
source code for these utilities should be in the same directory with the
word "src" somewhere in the filename.

If the install is being done from an AppleShare-mounted volume,
the install utility must be in the same folder as the data files.

There will be two images of each file.  One in "raw" Unix format
and one in a binhex format.  Therefore, base20 and base20.hqx both
contain the same information, but base20.hqx has been encoded in
binhex format.  Download the files; if necessary, decode them so
you have all of the files as base20, etc20, etc.  This can be
accomplished from the .hqx files by using _Stuffit Expander_ or
any one of a number of freeware and shareware Macintosh tools.
