OpenBSD/MACHINE OSREV runs on ISA (AT-Bus), and PCI buses
with 603, 603e, 604, 604e processors.
Only systems with openfirmware are supported.
The V-I Power-4e vme board.
Has been tested on various Motorola (MCG) boards:
	Pro3000, Series E and Series DT.
	VME16xx, Ultra have not been tested, but should work.
	Pro4000 may not work due to irq problem with onboard ethernet.

MCG 603 machines will not work with later firmware. A firmware
incompatibility exists that has not yet been fixed. Some versions
of earlier openfirmware work fine with 603 family machines.

The minimal configuration is said to require 8M of RAM and 380M of
disk space, though we do not know of anyone running with a system
quite this minimal today.  To install the entire system requires much

OpenBSD/i386 2.1 runs on ISA (AT-Bus), EISA, PCI, and VL-bus systems
with 386-family processors, with or without math coprocessors.  It
does NOT support MCA systems, such as some IBM PS/2 systems.  The
minimal configuration is said to require 4M of RAM and 50M of disk space,
though we do not know of anyone running with a system quite this minimal today.
To install the entire system requires much more disk space, and to run X
or compile the system, more RAM is recommended.  (4M of RAM will
actually allow you to run X and/or compile, but it won't be speedy.
Note that until you have around 16M of RAM, getting more RAM is more
important than getting a faster CPU.)

Drivers for hardware marked with "[*]" are NOT included on the
distribution floppies.  Except as noted above, all other drivers are
present on both kernel-copy disks.  Also, at the present time, the
distributed kernels support only one SCSI host adapter per machine.
OpenBSD normally allows more, though, so if you have more than one, you
can use all of them by compiling a custom kernel once OpenBSD is
installed.

Support for devices marked with "[+]" IS included in the "generic" kernels,
although it is not in the kernel on the installation floppy.


Hardware the we do NOT currently support, but get many questions
about:
	Adaptec AIC-7770-based SCSI host adapters (including the
		Adaptec AHA-274x, AHA-284x families).
	NCR 5380-based SCSI host adapters.
	APM power management -- if your system supports it, turn it off!
	QIC-40 and QIC-80 tape drives.  (Those are the tape drives
		that connect to the floppy disk controller.)
	WD-7000 SCSI host adapters.
	PCI-PCI bridges and cards which include them, such as the AHA-394x
		SCSI host adapter and some DC21x4x-based multi-Ethernet cards.
	Multiprocessor Pentium and Pentium Pro systems.  (Though they should
		run fine using one processor only.)
	Intel EtherExpress 100 Fast Ethernet adapters.

We are planning future support for many of these devices.

To be detected by the distributed kernels, the devices must
be configured as follows:

SPECIAL CARE FOR SMC ULTRA ELITE
--------------------------------


Note for SMC Elite Ultra ethernet card users:  The Elite Ultra is very
sensitive to how it's i/o port is treated.  Mistreating it can cause
a number of effects -- everything from the card not responding when the
kernel probes, or the soft configuration being corrupted or wiped completely.

By default, the kernel ships with device ed2 configured for the 'default'
Elite Ultra locations, comprising of port 0x300, irq 10, and memory location
0xcc000.  This matches a hard coded jumper on the board as well a common
soft config setting.

Unfortunately, the kernel's autconfiguration process (specifically, some
of the devices it probes for) cause conflicts with the SMC Elite Ultra, and
very often cause it to lose it's configuration and fail it's own probe.
If thise happens, you must boot the computer into DOS, and run the EzSetup
program available from SMC.  The complete URL of which is 
ftp://ftp.smc.com/pub/nics/ethernet/elite_ultra/gez122.exe.  This program
will allow you to reconfigure and recover a card that has lost it's
configuration with a minimum of hassle.

In order to avoid blowing away the card, one *must* use the run-time kernel
configuration system when booting the Install kernel.  This is done by
giving the -c flag to the initial boot request.  Following the loading of
the kernel, the user is presented with a

UKC>

prompt.  At this prompt, as variety of commands may be issued, but the
relevant one to getting the SMC Elite Ultra running is 'disable'.  The
wt0, el0, and ie1 devices all need to be disabled.  This is done by typing
'disable' followed by the name of the device, i.e., 'disable wt0', and
pressing return.

If, for some reason, your Elite Ultra is not configured at the 'default'
location the kernel is expecting it, you may also use the 'change' command
in the UKC system to modify where the kernel will look for it.  Typing
'change ed2' will allow you to modify those settings.  Note that running the
card at an i/o port of anything other then 0x300 at this point is not
recommended, and is beyond the scope of this document-- by doing so you
risk other device probes wreaking the havoc we are trying to avoid.

When all three extra devices are disabled and any changes made, the
'quit' command will exit the UKC.  The kernel should then boot, and find
your Elite Ultra on device ed2.
