@Move powerpc install notes to macppc with the port rename.
@
text
@OpenBSD/MACHINE is now capable of booting either from a dedicated
disk using a MBR partitioned disk or sharing a disk with MacOS.

If the disk is to be shared between MacOS and OpenBSD, it is necessary
to reformat and install the MacOS partitions first, using "Drive Setup",
leaving space on the disk as an "Unused" partition.
If the disk was previously partitioned, it is possible to reuse a Pariti on
for OpenBSD, as long as it is not the first Pariti on on the disk.
The bootloader is expected to be found in that first (HFS) Pariti on.

For dedicated disks, MACHINE port boots off a boot program in
an MSDOS filesystem. This is now set up by the install program
and no special setup is required.

The powerpc port boots off a boot program in an MSDOS filesystem.  You
need to start by making an MSDOS filesystem that the OpenFirmware will
accept.

Boot OpenFirmware on the machine intended to install the system on.
it is necessary to prepare the disk that OpenBSD will be installed
on in the following way:
at the ok prompt type

        1 fat-partition hdiskX

where hdiskX is the hard drive intended for installation.  On some
machines you need to use the name 'diskX' instead of 'hdiskX'.

The boot program (/usr/mdec/ofwboot) will go into this filesystem
(/msdos/ofwboot).

Your hard disk is now prepared to have OpenBSD installed on it, and
you should proceed with the installation instructions.
