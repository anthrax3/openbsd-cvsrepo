		cd{:--:}OSrev.fs The standard MACHINE boot and installation
				CD image; see below.

There are several ways to boot a supported PowerPC Macintosh system into
the OpenBSD installer.  Unfortunately they all currently require some
limited knowledge of Open Firmware, the low-level process that controls
the microprocessor after hardware initialization and diagnostics are
performed but before control is handed to the operating system.

To access Open Firmware you should simultaneously hold down the
Command, Option, O and F keys immediately upon booting.  You will
be presented with information and a ">" prompt that will look something
like this (example taken from a Power Macintosh G4):

Apple PowerMac3,1 2.4f1 BootROM built on 02/18/00 at 09:44:35
Copyright 1994-2000 Apple Computer, Inc.
All Rights Reserved

Welcome to Open Firmware
To continue booting, type "mac-boot" and press return
To shut down, type "shut-down" and press return

 ok
0 >

Important Open Firmware command examples:
-----------------------------------------

boot cd:,ofwboot /OSREV/MACHINE/bsd.rd

		(boot from an appropriately prepared
		OpenBSD CD in the CD/DVD drive)

boot enet:,ofwboot /bsd.rd

		(netboot from a pre-configured bootp/tftp/nfs
		server containing the "ofwboot" and "bsd.rd"
		files at the root directory of the tftp server)

boot ide1:,ofwboot /bsd

		(After installation, boot /bsd from the slave
		 device on the second ATA bus)

mac-boot	(boot into MacOS)
reset-all	(reboot the machine)
shut-down	(halt the machine; shutdown)
printenv	(print current machine variables)
setenv		(set a machine variable)
devalias	(list device aliases; useful for locating other
		devices in the machine such as hard drives etc)

As seen above, device aliases typically take the form of "ide", "cd"
etc.  To boot to an alternative device you may substitute them
with entries from this list (example devices taken from a Power
Macintosh G4):

ultra0 = hd = master device, primary ATA bus (factory-installed drive)
ultra1 =      slave device, primary ATA bus
ide0   = cd = master device, secondary ATA bus (CD/DVD drive)
ide1   =      slave device, secondary ATA bus (Zip drive, if installed)
enet   =      motherboard ethernet device

Other Open Firmware command examples:
-------------------------------------

setenv auto-boot? false

		(force the machine to wait at Open Firmware
		for user input at next reboot; options are true/false)

setenv boot-device ide:,ofwboot /bsd

		(force the machine to boot into OpenBSD
		automatically at next reboot)

dev /		(change to root level of the device tree)
pwd		(show current location in the device tree)
ls		(show items at current location in the device tree)
words		(show methods of items at current location in the device tree)
.properties	(show properties of items at current location in the device tree)


NOTES:
	The powerpc port does not currently support booting from a USB
	Zip drive, if installed.

	To reset a Power Macintosh to the factory-configure Open Firmware
	settings, simultaneously hold down the Command, Option, P, R keys
	immediately upon booting.  Typically the machine will then attempt to
	load Mac OS, if available.

There are several ways to boot a supported PowerPC Macintosh system into
the OpenBSD installer.  Unfortunately they all currently require some
limited knowledge of Open Firmware commands.  Examples are provided below
for common configurations.
d25 3
a27 5
To access Open Firmware:
Upon booting, simultaneously hold down the Command, Option, O and F
keys until you are presented with a > prompt at which you can enter
commands, such as the "boot" command or others that allow you to view the
structure of the device tree. (cd /devalias, .properties)
d29 2
a30 2
Typical boot commands can be used by entering them at the Open Firmware
prompt and pressing enter/return.
d32 2
a33 2
To netboot from a pre-configured bootp/tftp/nfs server containing the
"ofwboot" and "bsd.rd" files at the root directory of the tftp server:
d35 1
a35 1
	boot enet:,ofwboot /bsd.rd
d37 2
a38 2
To boot from a HFS formatted CD containing the "ofwboot", "bsd.rd" and all
other installation files at the root directory of the CD:
d40 1
a40 1
	boot cd:,ofwboot /OSREV/MACHINE/bsd.rd
d42 3
a44 3
Post-install, you will need to boot into OpenBSD from a hard drive, and
may need to reboot to Mac OS if you have it installed on another drive
connected to the system.  Typical commands for this are as follows:
d46 1
a46 5
To boot to an OpenBSD system installed on an ATA drive configured 
as a slave and connected to the same bus as the CD/DVD drive on a Power
Macintosh G4 (Tower):
	
	boot ide1:,ofwboot /bsd
d48 2
a49 1
To reboot to Mac OS:
d51 7
a57 1
	mac-boot
d59 4
a62 3
Typically, substituting the device alias (devalias) will allow for easy to
understand device selection.  Typical examples from a Power Macintosh G4
(Tower):
d65 37
a101 9
ultra1 = slave device, primary ATA bus
ide0 = cd = master device, secondary ATA bus (CD/DVD drive)
ide1 = slave device, secondary ATA bus (Zip drive, if installed)
enet = motherboard ethernet device

NOTE:
The powerpc port does not currently support sharing the disk with MacOS
This is an important fact on the iMac which does not support more than
one disk.

Instead of the single floppy, currently multiple floppies for different
systems exist. boot.fs is for VI vme board machines, and Motorola Powerstack
(and possibly other machines) and bootofw.fs is generic and should run on
any system with openfirmware because it only uses openfirmware for device
drivers (not recommended for general use).
This is a bootable install floppy which can be used both to install and to
upgrade OpenBSD to the current version.  It is also useful for maintenance
and disaster recovery.  In addition, the "tools/" directory contains some
utilities that might be useful for the installation.

"powerpc" subdirectory of the distribution.  That subdirectory is laid
out as follows:

		INSTALL.powerpc	Installation notes; this file.

		CKSUM		Output of the cksum(1) and md5(1) programs
		MD5		usable for verification of the correctness

The OpenBSD/powerpc binary distribution sets contain the binaries which
comprise the OpenBSD 2.3 release for the powerpc.  There are seven binary
distribution sets.  The binary distribution sets can be found in
the "powerpc" subdirectory of the OpenBSD 2.3 distribution tree,
and are as follows:

	base23	The OpenBSD/powerpc 2.3 base binary distribution.  You
		MUST install this distribution set.  It contains the
		base OpenBSD utilities that are necessary for the
		system to run and be minimally functional.  It
		includes shared library support, and excludes
		everything described below.
		[ 12.5M gzipped, 35.1M uncompressed ]

	comp23	The OpenBSD/powerpc Compiler tools.  All of the tools
		relating to C, C++, and FORTRAN (yes, there are two!).
		This set includes the system include files
		(/usr/include), the linker, the compiler tool chain,
		and the various system libraries (except the shared
		libraries, which are included as part of the base
		set).  This set also includes the manual pages for all
		of the utilities it contains, as well as the system
		call and library manual pages.
		[ 7.7M gzipped, 24.2M uncompressed ]

	etc23	This distribution set contains the system
		configuration files that reside in /etc and in several
		other places.  This set MUST be installed if you are
		installing the system from scratch, but should NOT be
		used if you are upgrading.  (If you are upgrading,
		it's recommended that you get a copy of this set and
		CAREFULLY upgrade your configuration files by hand.)
		[ 92K gzipped, 450K uncompressed ]

	game23	This set includes the games and their manual pages.
		[ 2.8M gzipped, 6.7M uncompressed ]

	man23	This set includes all of the manual pages for the
		binaries and other software contained in the base set.
		Note that it does not include any of the manual pages
		that are included in the other sets.
		[ 2.5M gzipped, 9.6M uncompressed ]

	misc23	This set includes the system dictionaries (which are
		rather large), the typesettable document set, and
		man pages for other architectures which happen to be
		installed from the source tree by default.
		[ 1.7M gzipped, 6.1M uncompressed ]

	text23	This set includes OpenBSD's text processing tools,
		including groff, all related programs, and their
		manual pages.
		[ 1.0M gzipped, 3.5M uncompressed ]
