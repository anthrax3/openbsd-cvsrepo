Installation is supported from several media types, including:

	CD-ROM
	FFS partitions
	HTTP

Not all methods are supported on all SPARC Systems and some of them
work only with the floppy or the miniroot installation.

If you have the OpenBSD CD-ROM distribution (and a CD-ROM drive), you may be
able to boot from it, or from the supplied bootable CD-ROM mini image.
However, not all SPARC systems support booting from CD-ROM, and the current
boot image is only known to work on sun4c and sun4m architecture workstations.
If you can boot from the CD-ROM, you are home free and can proceed to the
installation steps.  If not, you will need to do some setup work to prepare
a bootable image: either a floppy, hard drive, or compatible net boot
server.

In addition to the bootable image, you also need to consider how to
access the binary distribution sets to actually install the system.

Although you can access the distribution sets directly from the CD-ROM or
from one of the OpenBSD mirrors over the internet, you may wish to transfer
the sets to a local HTTP server, or copy them to a partition on the target
system's disk.

OpenBSDXferCDROM

OpenBSDXferFloppyFromDOS

OpenBSDXferFloppyFromUNIX

Creating a bootable hard disk using SunOS, Solaris or other Un*x-like system:

	If you don't have a floppy drive you can copy the floppy
	installation image "floppy{:--:}OSrev.fs" or the miniroot "miniroot{:--:}OSrev.fs"
	onto the hard disk you intend to boot on.  Traditionally, the
	way to do this is to use dd(1) to place the bootable filesystem
	image in the "swap" partition of the disk (while running in
	single user mode), and then booting from that partition.

	Using the "b" partition allows you to boot without overwriting
	any useful parts of the disk; you can also use another partition,
	but don't use the "a" or "c" partition without understanding
	the disk label issues described below under "incompatible systems".

	This requires that you be running SunOS, Solaris, OpenBSD, or NetBSD,
	which have a compatible view of SunOS disk labels and partitions.

	Use the dd(1) utility to copy the file to the hard drive.
	The command would likely be, under SunOS:
		dd if=floppy{:--:}OSrev.fs of=/dev/rsd0b bs=36b
				- or -
		dd if=miniroot{:--:}OSrev.fs of=/dev/rsd0b bs=36b
	and under Solaris:
		dd if=floppy{:--:}OSrev.fs of=/dev/rdsk/c0t0d0s1 bs=36b
				- or -
		dd if=miniroot{:--:}OSrev.fs of=/dev/rdsk/c0t0d0s1 bs=36b

	The blocksize is arbitrary as long as it's a multiple of 512 bytes
	and within the maximum supported by the driver, i.e. bs=126b may
	not work for all cases.  Again, device/partition names may vary,
	depending on the OS involved.

	If you are preparing the hard drive on an incompatible system or
	don't care about the hard disk contents, you can also install the
	bootable image starting at the beginning of the disk. This lets
	you prepare a bootable hard-drive even if don't have a working
	operating system on your SPARC, but it is important to understand
	that the bootable image installed this way includes a "disk label"
	which can wipe out any pre-existing disk labels or partitioning for
	the drive.

	The floppy image is used only for booting, and can be placed in
	a partition that will be overwritten during the install process,
	since it actually runs off a ram-disk image in the kernel.  In
	contrast the miniroot is a normal unix root filesystem and you
	must place it in a partition that WILL NOT BE OVERWRITTEN until
	you've completed the installation process.

	To copy the floppy image to the whole disk, overwriting labels:
	Under SunOS:
		dd if=floppy{:--:}OSrev.fs of=/dev/rsdXc bs=36b
	and under Solaris:
		dd if=floppy{:--:}OSrev.fs of=/dev/rdsk/c0tXd0s2 bs=36b

	Two notes - X should be replaced by the unit number of the target
	disk, which is most likely *not* the disk/partition that's your
	current root partition.  Again names may vary depending on the
	OS involved.  Second, after doing this, the disklabel will be one
	that would be appropriate for a floppy, i.e. one partition of 2880
	blocks, and you'll probably want to change that later on.

	To copy the floppy image to the hard disk, preserving SunOS,
	Solaris, NetBSD or OpenBSD labels:
	Under SunOS:
		dd if=floppy{:--:}OSrev.fs of=/dev/rsdXc bs=1b skip=1 seek=1
	and Solaris:
		dd if=floppy{:--:}OSrev.fs of=/dev/rdsk/c0tXd0s2 \
		    bs=1b skip=1 seek=1

	You need to be sure that your version of dd(1) supports the
	skip and seek operands, otherwise you can try a technique like:

		dd if=/dev/rsdXc of=/tmp/label bs=1b count=1
		dd if=floppy{:--:}OSrev.fs of=/dev/rsdXc bs=36b
		dd if=/tmp/label of=/dev/rsdXc bs=1b count=1

	In either case, you've created a situation where the disk label
	and the filesystem information don't agree about the partition
	size and geometry, however the results will be usable.

Creating a network bootable setup using SunOS or other Un*x-like system:

	The details of setting up a network bootable environment vary
	considerably, depending on the network's host.  Extract the
	OpenBSD diskless(8) man page from the man{:--:}OSrev.tgz distribution
	set or see the copy on the OpenBSD web page.  You will also
	need to reference the relevant man pages or administrators guide
	for the host system.
	
	Basically, you will need to set up reverse-arp (rarpd) and boot
	parameter (rpc.bootparamd) information and make the OpenBSD
	bootblock, kernel/miniroot partition, and a swap file available
	as required by the netboot setup.

@Jumbo commit for 4.7 installation instructions:
- do not mention tape as an installation media on systems where it is very
  unlikely that a tape drive can be connected to (i.e. anything with only
  USB as expansion capabilities)
- do not mention that fetching the installation sets from a partition is
  ``for upgrades only''. You may do this for installation, but of course
  you can not use a partition which will be newfs'ed for that purpose.
- mention ext2fs partitions as possible installation sets source only on
  platforms where the installation media actually can mount an ext2fs
  filesystem.
- stress the fact that the sparc miniroot image is a GENERIC kernel with
  a little on-disk filesystem, and not a RAMDISK kernel with a little
  in-memory filesystem, and thus must not be overwritten during installation
  (i.e. be careful if you repartition the disk the miniroot has been put on).
- more conv=sync -> conv=osync for tape setup instructions.
- model-specific layout changes on armish, loongson and socppc instructions.
- fix various typos and grammar mistaeks.

If you have the OpenBSD CD-ROM distribution (and a CD-ROM drive), you
may be able boot from it.  Not all sparc systems support booting from
CD-ROM and the current boot image is only known to work on sun4c and
some sun4m architecture workstations.  If you can boot from the CD-ROM,
you are home free and can proceed to the installation steps.  If not,
you will need to do some setup work to prepare a bootable image, either
a floppy, hard drive, tape, or compatible net boot server.

	CD-ROM
a31 64
The variety of options listed may seem confusing, but situations vary
widely in terms of what peripherals and what sort of network arrangements
a user has, the intent is to provide some way that will be practical.


Creating a bootable floppy disk using DOS/Windows:

	First you need to get access to the OpenBSD bootable floppy
	images. If you can access the distribution from the CD-ROM under 
	DOS, you will find the bootable disks in the OSREV/MACHINE 
	directory. Otherwise, you will have to download them from one of 
	the OpenBSD ftp or http mirror sites, using an ftp client or a web 
	browser. In either case, take care to do "binary" transfers, since 
	these are images files and any DOS cr/lf translations or control/z 
	EOF interpretations will result in corrupted transfers.
	
	You will also need to go to the "tools" directory and grab a
	copy of the rawrite.exe utility and its documentation.  This
	program is needed to correctly copy the bootable filesystem
	image to the floppy, since it's an image of a unix partition
	containing a ffs filesystem, not a MSDOS format diskette.

	Once you have installed rawrite.exe, just run it and specify the
	name of the bootable image, such as "floppy.fs" and the name of
	the floppy drive, such as "a:".  Be sure to use good quality HD
	(1.44MB) floppies, formatted on the system you're using.  The
	image copy and boot process is not especially tolerant of read
	errors. 

	Note that if you are using NT to write the images to disk, you
	will need to use ntrw.exe instead.  It is also available in the
	"tools" directory.  Grab it and run in with the correct 
	arguments like this "ntrw <image> <drive>:"

	Note that, when installing, the boot floppy can be write-protected
	(i.e.  read-only).


Creating a bootable floppy disk using SunOS or other Un*x-like system:

	First, you will need obtain a local copy of the bootable filesystem
	image as described above.  If possible use the cksum(1) or md5(1) 
	commands to verify the checksums of the images vs. the values in 
	the CKSUM or MD5 files on the mirror site.

	Next, use the dd(1) utility to copy the file to the floppy drive.
	Under SunOS, the command would be:

		dd if=floppy{:--:}OSrev.fs of=/dev/rfd0c bs=36b

	If you are using something other than SunOS, you may have to adapt
	this to conform to local naming conventions for the floppy and
	options suitable for copying to a "raw" floppy image.  The key
	issue is that the device name used for the floppy *must* be one
	that refers to the correct block device, not a partition or
	compatibility mode, and the copy command needs to be compatible
	with the requirement that writes to a raw device must be in
	multiples of 512-byte blocks.  The variations are endless and
	beyond the scope of this document.

	If you're doing this on the system you intend to boot the floppy on,
	copying the floppy back to a file and doing a compare or checksum
	is a good way to verify that the floppy is readable and free of
	read/write errors.

The steps necessary to prepare the distribution sets for installation
depend on which method of installation you choose.  Some methods
require a bit of setup first that is explained below.

The floppy installation allows installing OpenBSD directly from FTP
mirror sites over the internet, however you must consider the speed and
reliability of your internet connection for this option.  It may save
much time and frustration to use ftp get/reget to transfer the
distribution sets to a local server or disk and perform the installation
from there, rather than directly from the internet.


To install or upgrade OpenBSD using a tape, you need to do the following:

	To install OpenBSD from a tape, you need to make a tape that
	contains the distribution set files, each in "tar" format or
	in "gzipped tar format".  First you will need to transfer the
	distribution sets to your local system, using ftp or by mounting
	the CD-ROM containing the release.  Then you need to make a tape
	containing the files.

	If you're making the tape on a UN*X-like system, the easiest way
	to do so is make a shell script along the following lines, call it
	"/tmp/maketape".

	#! /bin/sh
	tape=/dev/nrst0
	mt -f ${tape} rewind
	if test $# -lt 1
	then
		for file in bsd.rd boot
		do
			dd if=${file} of=${tape} obs=8k conv=sync
		done
	fi
	for file in base etc comp game man misc xbase xfont xserv xshare
	do
		dd if=${file}OSrev.tgz of=${tape} obs=8k conv=sync
	done
	tar cf ${tape} bsd
	mt -f ${tape} offline
	# end of script


	And then:

	cd .../OSREV/sparc
	sh -x /tmp/maketape

	
	Note that this script creates a bootable tape. If you only want to
	fetch the OpenBSD files from tape, but want to boot from another
	device, you can save time and space creating the tape this way:

	cd .../OSREV/sparc
	sh -x /tmp/maketape noboot

	
	If you're using a system other than OpenBSD or SunOS, the tape
	name and other requirements may change.
d135 1
a135 2
To install OpenBSD using a remote partition, mounted via
NFS, you must do the following:
d137 1
a137 40
	NOTE:	This method of installation is recommended only for
		those already familiar with using BSD network
		configuration and management commands.  If you aren't,
		this documentation should help, but is not intended to
		be all-encompassing.

	Place the OpenBSD distribution sets you wish to install into a
	directory on an NFS server, and make that directory mountable
	by the machine on which you are installing or upgrading OpenBSD.
	This will probably require modifying the /etc/exports file
	of the NFS server and resetting its mount daemon (mountd).
	(Both of these actions will probably require superuser
	privileges on the server.)

	You need to know the numeric IP address of the NFS server,
	and, if the server is not on a network directly connected to
	the machine on which you're installing or upgrading OpenBSD,
	you need to know the numeric IP address of the router closest
	to the OpenBSD machine.  Finally, you need to know the numeric
	IP address of the OpenBSD machine itself.

	Once the NFS server is set up properly and you have the
	information mentioned above, you can proceed to the next step
	in the installation or upgrade process.  If you're installing
	OpenBSD from scratch, go to the section on preparing your hard
	disk, below.  If you're upgrading an existing installation, go
	directly to the section on upgrading.

If you are upgrading OpenBSD, you also have the option of installing
OpenBSD by putting the new distribution sets somewhere in your existing
file system, and using them from there.  To do that, you must do the
following:

	Place the distribution sets you wish to upgrade somewhere in
	your current file system tree.  At a bare minimum, you must
	upgrade the "base" binary distribution, and so must put the
	"base{:--:}OSrev" set somewhere in your file system.  If you wish,
	you can do the other sets, as well, but you should NOT upgrade
	the "etc" distribution; the "etc" distribution contains system
	configuration files that you should review and update by hand.
d139 1
a139 2
	Once you have done this, you can proceed to the next step in
	the upgrade process, actually upgrading your system.

	contains the distribution set files, in "tar" format.  If
	you're making the tape on a UN*X-like system, the easiest way
	to do so is probably something like:

		tar cf <tape_device> <dist_directories>

	where "<tape_device>" is the name of the tape device that
	describes the tape drive you're using (possibly /dev/rst0, or
	something similar, but it will vary from system to system.
	(If you can't figure it out, ask your system administrator.)
	In the above example, "<dist_directories>" are the
	distribution sets' directories, for the distribution sets you
	wish to place on the tape.  For instance, to put the "base21"
	and "etc21" distributions on tape (in order to do the absolute
	minimum installation to a new disk), you would do the
	following:

		cd .../2.1		# the top of the tree
		cd sparc
		tar cf <tape_device> base21 etc21

	(Note that you still need to fill in "<tape_device>" in the
	example.)

	Once you have the files on the tape, you can proceed to the
	next step in the installation or upgrade process.  If you're
	installing OpenBSD from scratch, go to the section on preparing
	your hard disk, below.  If you're upgrading an existing
	installation, go directly to the section on upgrading.

If you have the OpenBSD CD-ROM distribution (and a CD-ROM drive)
you can boot from it.  Otherwise, you will need to create a bootable
disk.  This may be a floppy or a hard disk (floppy is simplest).

To boot from CD-ROM:

	At the PROM monitor type type the appropriate command to boot
	from a CR-ROM.  This will be something like "boot cdrom bsd"
	or "boot sd(0,6,0)bsd", consult your Sun PROM manual for the
	correct version.  If the boot is successul, you will get a
	loader version message, executable sizes and then the Kernel
	copyright and device probe messages.  Boot failure modes are
	typically a lot of CD-ROM drive action, but no messages or
	complaints about magic numbers, checksums or formats.

	Not all sparc systems support bootable CDROMS and the current
	boot image is only known to work on sun4c architctures.  If it
	does not work, you'll have to create a boot floppy or bootable
	hard disk; follow the directions below.  (A boot floppy image
	is included on the CD-ROM as 2.1/sparc/floppy.fs.)

If you have a floppy drive on your sparc:

	If you are using a UN*X-like system to write the floppy image to
	disk, you should use the "dd" command to copy the file system image
	(floppy.fs) directly to the raw floppy disk.  It is suggested
	that you read the dd(1) manual page or ask your system administrator
	to determine the correct set of arguments to use; it will be slightly
	different from system to system, and a comprehensive list of the
	possibilities is beyond the scope of this document.

	If you are using a DOS PC to write the floppy image to disk, you
	should use the "rawrite" utility, provided in the "i386/inst"
	directory of the OpenBSD distribution.  It will write the file
	system image (floppy.fs) to a disk.

	Note that, when installing, the floppy can be write-protected (i.e.
	read-only).

If you don't have a floppy drive on your sparc:

	If you don't have a floppy drive you can copy the floppy image
	onto the hard disk you intend to install OpenBSD on.  Doing so
	will overwrite the disk's old contents, however.

	You must use a UN*X-like system to write the floppy image to the
	hard disk you will be using for OpenBSD/sparc.  You should use the
	"dd" command to copy the file system image (floppy.fs) directly
	to the raw 'c' device (whole disk) of the target hard disk.  It
	is suggested that you read the dd(1) manual page or ask your system
	administrator to determine the correct set of arguments to use;
	it will be slightly different from system to system, and a
	comprehensive list of the possibilities is beyond the scope of
	this document.

	Please note that this will put a floppy disklabel on your
	disk which will confuse the install script.  To fix this
	you need to answer "n" to the first question when booting
	your disk and do "dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/rsd0c count=20"
	assuming your booted from sd0.  After doing this you
	will not be able to boot that disk again unless you
	complete the install.  You can now enter "install" and
	start the actual install process.

The steps necessary to prepare the distribution sets
for installation depend on which method of installation
you choose.  The various methods are explained below.

To prepare for installing via an NFS partition:

	Place the OpenBSD software you wish to install into
	a directory on an NFS server, and make that directory
	mountable by the machine which you will be installing
	OpenBSD on.  This will probably require modifying the
	/etc/exports file of the NFS server and resetting
	mountd, acts which will require superuser privileges.
	Note the numeric IP address of the NFS server and of
	the router closest to the the new OpenBSD machine,
	if the NFS server is not on a network which is
	directly attached to the OpenBSD machine.

	If you are using a diskless setup to install OpenBSD on
	your machine, you can take advantage of the fact that
	the above has already been done on your machine's server.
	So, you can conveniently put the OpenBSD filesets in your
	machine's root filesystem on the server where the install
	program can find them.

	Once you have done this, you can proceed to the next
	step in the installation process, preparing your
	system for OpenBSD installation.

To prepare for installing via FTP:

	NOTE: this method of installation is recommended
	      only for those already familiar with using
	      the BSD network-manipulation commands and
	      interfaces.  If you aren't, this documentation
	      should help, but is not intended to be
	      all-encompassing.

	The preparations for this method of installation
	are easy: all you have to do is make sure that
	there's some FTP site from which you can retrieve
	the OpenBSD installation when it's time to do
	the install.  You should know the numeric IP
	address of that site, the numeric IP address of
	your nearest router if one is necessary

	Once you have done this, you can proceed to the next
	step in the installation process, preparing your
	system for OpenBSD installation.

To prepare for installing via a tape:

	To install OpenBSD from a tape, you need to somehow
	get the OpenBSD filesets you wish to install on
	your system on to the appropriate kind of tape,
	in tar format.

	If you're making the tape on a UN*X system, the easiest
	way to do so is:

		tar cvf <tape_device> <files>

	where "<tape_device>" is the name of the tape device
	that describes the tape drive you're using (possibly
	something like /dev/nrst0, but we make no guarantees 8-).
	Under SunOS 5.x, this would be something like /dev/rmt/0mbn.
	Again, your mileage may vary.  If you can't figure it out,
	ask your system administrator.  "<files>" are the names
	of the "set_name.nnn" files which you want to be placed
	on the tape.

	Once you have done this, you can proceed to the next
	step in the installation process, preparing your 
	system for OpenBSD installation.

	Since the current OpenBSD/sparc installation program uses
	a diskless setup for your workstation, you will already
	have to prepare an NFS directory for use as a remote
	root filesystem (see the section `Installing the OpenBSD System'
	below for details). The easiest way is to put the OpenBSD filesets
	in this root filesystem on the server where the install program
	will find them.

	However, you have the option to put the filesets in
	another directory or even on another NFS server. To do
	so, follow these guide lines:
