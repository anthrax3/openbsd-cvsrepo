@dnl	$OpenBSD: hardware,v 1.82 2015/01/11 21:02:55 miod Exp $
OpenBSD/MACHINE OSREV runs on the following classes of machines:
    * sun4: the VME series
	- 4/100: Original SPARC with VME. Many hardware bugs.
	- 4/200: A fairly decent VME-only machine
	- 4/300: a 25MHz VME machine with many devices built onto the main
	  board. In other respects, it is quite similar to the SS1+.

    * sun4c:
    	- SS1: the original 20MHz sun4c. Hardware limitations prevent SBus
	  DMA peripherals from working in some of the slots.
	- SS1+: 25MHz version of the above. Hardware limitations prevent
	  SBus DMA peripherals from working in some of the slots.
	- IPC: SS1+ in a cube, with bwtwo graphics builtin
	- SLC: SS1+ built into a B&W monitor
	- SS2: 40MHz version of the SS1
	- IPX: SS2 in a cube, with cgsix graphics builtin
	- ELC: SS2-performance built into a B&W monitor

    * sun4e:
	- SPARCengine 1E: a 6U VME cross between a sun4 and a sun4c,
	  similar to a Sun 4/300 with an OpenPROM interface.

    * sun4m:
	- 600MP: The original Sun4m machine. This is an mbus machine with
	  SBus and VME busses.
	- LC: 50MHz MicroSPARC-1 based machines (aka Classic)
	- LX: LC with a few more devices
	- SS4: Reduced cost version of the SS5, available at 70MHz and
	  110MHz
	- SS5: MicroSPARC-2 based machines available in 60, 70, 85, and 110
	  MHz versions
	- SS5: TurboSPARC cpus in accelerated SS5 machines, running at
	  170MHz
	- SS10: Pizzabox mbus-based machine
	- SS20: Improved pizzabox mbus-based machine
	- Sun Voyager

    * As well as faithful clones of the above Sun systems, such as:
	- Aries Research Inc, Parrot II (SS2 clone)
	- Axil 243 and 245 (and possibly other models) (SS5 clones)
	- Axil 320 (SS20 clone)
	- CPU5V: VME card by Force Computer (sun4m)
	- DTKstation/Classic+
	- Fujitsu S-4/Leia2 (MicroSPARC-2 laptop)
	- Goldstar GWS-40 (SS2 clone)
	- Opus 5000 (SS1 clone)
	- Opus 5250 (SS1 clone)
	- RDI,PowerLite: sun4m models, available in 50MHz, 85MHz, and 110MHz
	- RDI,BrigeLite
	- Solair WS19L (SS10 clone)
	- SPARCbook 3, 3GS, 3GX, 3TX and 3XP by Tadpole (MicroSPARC-2 laptops)
	- Tatung micro COMPstation 5 (SS5 clone)
	- Tatung micro COMPstation LX (LX clone)
	- Tatung TWS,SuperCOMPstation-20S (SS20 clone)
	- Transtec SS5/170

For sun4m machines, the following mbus CPU modules are supported:
	- SM30: 30 or 36 MHz SuperSPARC with no secondary cache
	- SM40: 40 MHz SuperSPARC with no secondary cache
	- SM41: 40 MHz SuperSPARC with 1MB of secondary cache
	- SM50: 50 MHz SuperSPARC with no secondary cache
	- SM51: 50 MHz SuperSPARC with 1MB of secondary cache
	- SM51-2: 50 MHz SuperSPARC with 2MB of secondary cache
	- SM61: 60 MHz SuperSPARC with 1MB of secondary cache
	- SM61-2: 60 MHz SuperSPARC with 2MB of secondary cache
	- SM71: 75 MHz SuperSPARC with 1MB of secondary cache
	- SM81: 85 MHz SuperSPARC with 1MB of secondary cache
	- SM81-2: 85 MHz SuperSPARC with 2MB of secondary cache
	- SM100: dual 40 MHz Cypress 7C601 with 64KB of primary cache
	- Ross HyperSPARC RT620/625 at 90 MHz, with 256KB of primary cache
	- Ross HyperSPARC RT620/625 at 125 MHz, with 256KB of primary cache
	- Ross HyperSPARC RT620/625 at 150 MHz, with 512KB of primary cache
	- Ross HyperSPARC RT620/625 at 166 MHz, with 512KB of primary cache
	- Ross HyperSPARC RT620/625 at 180 MHz, with 512KB of primary cache

24MB of RAM should be sufficient to boot and a minimal system can probably
be squeezed onto a 250MB disk by installing only the `base' set.
However, a minimum of 32MB is recommended for serious usage of the system.
Note that until you have at least 32MB of RAM, getting more RAM is more
important than getting a faster CPU board.

Supported devices {:-include-:}:
    * Sun keyboard and mouse
    	- Type 2, 3, 4, and 5 keyboards with several layouts

    * Floppy drives:
	- sun4c and sun4m floppy disk drive

    * Serial ports:
	- ttya and ttyb on-board serial ports (can be used as console if
	  needed)
	- 4/300 ttyc and ttyd on-board serial ports
	- SBus magma serial port cards, including: 4Sp, 8Sp, 12Sp, 16Sp,
	  LC2+1Sp, 2+1Sp, 4+1Sp, 8+2Sp, and 2+1HS Sp.
	- SBus Serial Parallel Interface (SUNW,spif, 501-1931)

    * Audio support:
	- on-board audio support for systems with AMD79C30 8-bit audio chips
	  (this includes sun4c models, SPARCclassic, and 600MP)
	- SUNW,CS4231 16-bit audio chips found on SPARCstation 4/5

    * Framebuffers:
	- SBus and sun4c/sun4m on-board video:
	  + bwtwo - black and white
	  + cgthree - 8-bit color, unaccelerated
	    The cgthree driver also supports the cgRDI, an onboard
	    cgthree-like framebuffer found in some laptops.
	  + cgsix - 8-bit color, accelerated (GX, GX+, TGX, TGX+)
	    This driver should also work with faithful emulations or clones
	    of the SBus cgsix.
	  + cgtwelve - 24-bit color, 1-bit overlay, accelerated (but the
	    driver does not support hardware acceleration)
	  + cgfourteen - 8/24-bit color, accelerated (but the driver does
	    not support hardware acceleration)
	  + Fujitsu AG-10e (agten) - 24-bit color, accelerated (currently
	    only supported in 8-bit unaccelerated mode)
	  + Parallax XVideo and PowerVideo (tvtwo) - 24-bit color,

8MB of RAM should be sufficient to boot and a minimal system can probably
be squeezed onto a 250MB disk by installing only the `base' and `etc' sets.
However, a minimum of 16MB is necessary for the system not to be swap-bound,
with 32MB or more being recommended for serious usage of the system.

Hardware that we do NOT currently support, but get many questions about:
    * Serial Cards:
        - VME mti 16-port serial card
        - VME alm2 16-port serial card
        - VME mcp 4-port serial card (or is it 8-port)
    * Disk Controllers:
        - VME "sc" SCSI controller
        - VME IPI controller
    * Framebuffers:
        - VME cgfive, 8-bit color, 1-bit overlay, double-buffered,
	  unaccelerated without GP/GP2
        - VME cgnine, 24-bit color, 1-bit overlay, double-buffered,
	  unaccelerated without GP/GP2
        - VME GP/GP2 Graphics Processor (drives a cgfive or cgnine)
        - SBus cgeight, 24-bit color, unaccelerated
        - SBus GT, 24-bit color, 8-bit color, overlay planes,
	  double-buffered, 3-D acceleration (aka "Graphics Tower")
    * On-board Audio and ISDN
	This is present on some sun4m systems (LX, LC, SPARCstation 10/20)
    * Multiple Processors/Modules in sun4m systems
	OpenBSD will not currently boot on some machines with multiple
	processors. You must remove the extra CPUs.
    * SBus SUNW,bpp (parallel port)
    * SBus FDDI cards

The minimal configuration requires 16MB of RAM and at least 200MB of disk
space, by installing only the `base' and `etc' sets. To install the entire
system, at least 650MB is required, and to compile the system, more RAM is
recommended.  Note that until you have 32MB of RAM, getting more RAM is more
important than getting a faster CPU.

The minimal configuration requires 16MB of RAM and ~160MB of disk space.
To install the entire system requires much more disk space, and to run
X or compile the system, more RAM is recommended.  (OpenBSD with 32MB of
RAM or less feels like Solaris with 32MB of RAM or less.) Note that until
you have around 32MB of RAM, getting more RAM is more important than

X or compile the system, more RAM is recommended.  (OpenBSD with 4M of
RAM feels like Solaris with 4M of RAM.) Note that until you have
around 16M of RAM, getting more RAM is more important than getting a
faster CPU.)  Installation from "ramdisk" kernels requires 8M of RAM.

works on the widest range of machinery (sun4, sun4c, and sun4m).
If you have problems with the OpenBSD OSREV kernel in this distribution,
please visit the OpenBSD web page (http://www.openbsd.org) and the mailing
lists to review the current status and check for updates and distribution
errata.

If you have Sparc hardware you can donate or make available at nominal
cost, please mention this on the lists, many things aren't being tested
or developed simply because developers usually have only a Sparcstation
at hand, not an array of systems.  Donation or mid/long term loan of
UltraSparc (sun4u) or HyperSparc (sun4m) systems would help ensure the
long-term viability of OpenBSD on Sparc based systems.

Your support in terms of documenting previously unknown problems with
OpenBSD/MACHINE, helping debug known problems, implementing missing pieces,
and testing OpenBSD on various architectures is actively encouraged.
The OpenBSD mailing lists, web-pages and sendbug utility are your best
tools for helping make OpenBSD/MACHINE a better release.

As of the OpenBSD OSREV release there are still a few outstanding problems
with OpenBSD on some Sparc architectures.  Certain lower end CPU modules are
known to have problems, in particular the cache-less SM30 and SM40.
Support for the Viking/SuperSPARC implementations with cache has improved
dramatically.  Some sun4m machines are lacking useful floppy/audio support
and the VME bus on the 600MP is unsupported.

Hardware the we do NOT currently support, but get many questions
about:
	multiprocessor machines (ignores other CPUs..)
	audio driver for sun4m machines
	floppy driver for sun4m (can boot/install from ramdisk floppies though)
	interrupt driven SCSI driver for Sun 4/100's and 4/200's

works on the widest range of machinery (sun4m and otherwise).  Custom
kernel configurations for sun4m may run into difficulties, as of release
GENERIC is your best bet for a stable sun4m kernel.

There are a number of people actively working on improving the stability
of OpenBSD/sparc in the sun4m area.  If you have problems with the
OpenBSD 2.2 kernel in this distribution, please visit the OpenBSD web
page (http://www.openbsd.org) and the mailing lists to review the current
status and check for updates.

*** Note: sun4m caveats
  There are some known difficulties with some configurations of 
sun4m machines.  While the details have not been worked out fully,
tests show that there are problems with some sun4m systems, depending
on memory configuration and other factors.  The supplied GENERIC kernel
is the best attempt at a configuration that works on the widest range of
machinery (sun4m and otherwise).  Custom kernel configurations for sun4m
may run into difficulties, GENERIC is your best bet for a stable sun4m. 
Stability of the sun4m support in OpenBSD is improving, if you have
problems with the kernel supplied in this OpenBSD 2.1 release, 
visit the OpenBSD web page (http://www.openbsd.org/), use sendbug,
and get on the openbsd mailing lists for current information.
