	installboot	The OpenBSD/MACHINE boot loader installation program.
	bootxx		The OpenBSD/MACHINE boot block.
	boot		The OpenBSD/MACHINE secondary boot loader.
	boot.net	The OpenBSD/MACHINE network boot loader.


Please note that there are multiple bootable images and kernels, intended
to allow installing OpenBSD/MACHINE in a variety of situations without
requiring a pre-existing working operating system.

The kernel and boot images are provided for net booting installations.
While the OpenBSD bootblocks will work with the provided miniroot images,
Sun bootblocks require a separate kernel image and root filesystem.

The "miniroot{:--:}OSrev.fs" is a small bootable root filesystem that can be used
for installation or upgrade where there is some means to copy the miniroot
image into a swap or unused partition on the system, and also for diskless
or net booting.  This can be convenient if you have a existing installation
of OpenBSD, NetBSD, SunOS, or Solaris and wish to test or upgrade the
existing system to OpenBSD.

The "floppy{:--:}OSrev.fs" is a bootable floppy image, with contents similar
to a miniroot stored in a compressed kernel with pre-loaded ramdisk.

These bootable images are also useful as "failsafe" boots for system
maintenance and disaster recovery.

Bootable installation images:

The "floppy{:--:}OSrev.fs" is a new bootable floppy image, with contents similar
to a miniroot stored in a compressed kernel with pre-loaded ramdisk.  As
of release time, this version has not received adequate testing and may
not work reliably on many systems, but is provided as a convenience for
for people installing on Sun4m systems where the other floppy installation
method doesn't work due to lack of Sun4m floppy driver support.

The OpenBSD/sparc binary distribution sets contain the binaries which
comprise the OpenBSD 2.3 release for the sparc.  There are seven binary
distribution sets.  These binary distribution sets can be found in
the "sparc" subdirectory of the OpenBSD 2.3 distribution tree,
and are as follows:

	base23	The OpenBSD/sparc 2.3 base binary distribution.  You
		MUST install this distribution set.  It contains the
		base OpenBSD utilities that are necessary for the system
		to run and be minimally functional.  It includes shared
		library support, and excludes everything described below.
		[ 12.7M gzipped, 39.7M uncompressed ]

	etc23	This distribution set contains the system configuration
		files that reside in /etc and in several other places.
		This set MUST be installed if you are installing the
		system from scratch, but should NOT be used if you are
		upgrading.  (If you are upgrading, it's recommended that
		you get a copy of this set and then CAREFULLY upgrade your
		configuration files by hand.)
		[ 97K gzipped, 510K uncompressed ]

	comp23	The OpenBSD/sparc Compiler tools.  All of the tools
		relating to C, C++, and FORTRAN.
		This set includes the system include files
		(/usr/include), the linker, the compiler tool chain,
		and the various system libraries (except the shared
		libraries, which are included as part of the base
		set).  This set also includes the manual pages for all
		of the utilities it contains, as well as the system
		call and library manual pages.
		[ 8.2M gzipped, 27.4M uncompressed ]

	game23	This set includes the games and their manual pages.
		[ 2.8M gzipped, 6.9M uncompressed ]

	man23	This set includes all of the manual pages for the
		binaries and other software contained in the base set.
		Note that it does not include any of the manual pages
		that are included in the other sets.
		[ 2.4M gzipped, 9.2M uncompressed ]

	misc23	This set includes the system dictionaries (which are
		rather large), the typesettable document set, and
		man pages for other architectures which happen to be
		installed from the source tree by default.
		[ 1.7M gzipped, 5.9M uncompressed ]

	text23	This set includes OpenBSD's text processing tools,
		including groff, all related programs, and their
		manual pages.
		[ 994K gzipped, 3.7M uncompressed ]

In summary, there are two bootable sparc floppy images called "kc21.fs", 
and "floppy21.fs".  The "kc21.fs" is a bootable install floppy which can 
be used in conjunction with the "inst21.fs" or "upgr21.fs" floppy images 
to install or upgrade OpenBSD to the current version.  It is also useful 
for maintenance and disaster recovery.  The "floppy21.fs" image is a
compressed ramdisk install floppy, which is a single floppy compressed
version of what the "kc21.fs" and "inst21.fs" images do.  The "floppy21.fs"
image has not received as much testing as the non-compressed images, and
is provided as a convenience in hopes that it will work for most
people.  The "floppy21.fs" image must be used for installation on 
sun4m systems via floppy.  The kc21 and inst21 images will not work
for sun4m due to the lack of sun4m floppy driver support. 

The miniroot.fs may be loaded onto the swap partition of an
existing installation of OpenBSD, NetBSD, SunOS, or Solaris to allow
installation or upgrade over the existing system.

The sparc binary distribution sets are distributed in the same form as
the source distribution sets; catted together, the members of a set
form a gzipped tar file.  Each sparc binary distribution set also has
its own "CKSUMS" file, just as the source distribution sets do.  The
binary sets are "rooted" at /, that is, if you want to extract the
binaries "into" your system, i.e.  replace the system binaries with
them, you have to run the "tar xfp" from /.  Also note that if you
upgrade or install this way, those programs that you are using at the
time will NOT be replaced.  If you follow the normal installation or
upgrade procedures, this will be taken care of for you.

The sparc security distribution set is named "secr11" and can be found
in the "sparc/security" subdirectory of the OpenBSD RELEASE distribution
tree.  It contains crypt.c (the source file for the DES encryption
algorithm) and the binaries which depend on it.  It can only be found
on those sites which carry the complete OpenBSD distribution and that
can legally obtain it.  (Remember, because of United States law, this
distribution set may not be exported to locations outside of the
United States and Canada.)  [ 127K gzipped, 337K uncompressed ]
