OpenBSD/MACHINE runs on several SGI workstations and servers built upon
64-bit MIPS processors (R4000 and up), including the Indigo, Indigo2,
Indy, O2, Octane, Origin/Onyx and Fuel/Tezro families.

@Hook IP22 kernels to the build, and document how to boot the installation
media on them. Try to be helpful and explain how things may fail on the
older PROM and what to do about this.

OpenBSD/MACHINE OSREV is a new port to the SGI Mips processor computers.
Currently, in this initial stage the O2 workstation is supported and
hardware support is being worked on.

@This is VERY MUCH work in progress. However it is a first cut of notes
for the SGI install, hopefully being partly helpful to get started.
