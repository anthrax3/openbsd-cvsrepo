@simpler dual boot instructions
@
text
@First and foremost, before beginning the installation process, MAKE
SURE YOU HAVE A RELIABLE BACKUP of any data on your hard disk that you
wish to keep.  Repartitioning your hard disk is an excellent way to
destroy important data.

The OpenBSD root partition must reside completely within the BIOS
supported part of the hard disk -- this could typically be 504MB, 2GB,
8GB or 128GB, depending upon the age of the machine and its BIOS. The
rest of the OpenBSD partitions can be anywhere that hardware supports.

If you plan to dual boot, use the other operating system's "fdisk" program
or partition editor to create at least one of the partitions to be used for
that operating system.  If that operating system is already set up to use the
entire disk, you will need to make space available.  Windows 7 can resize its
own system partition.  In the control panel, search for "partition": this
will lead you to the system administration tool.  You do not have to create an
OpenBSD partition at this time; the OpenBSD installation will give you an
opportunity to create the partition needed for OpenBSD.


Your hard disk is now prepared to have OpenBSD installed on it, and
you should proceed with the installation instructions.

entire disk, you will have to back it up, remove and recreate a smaller
partition for it, and then restore the data from that partition.  You do not
have to create an OpenBSD partition at this time; the OpenBSD installation
will give you an opportunity to create the partition needed for OpenBSD.

There is a tool called fips 2.0 that can shrink your FAT-based DOS/Windows
partition to make room for OpenBSD.  It is included in the MACHINE tools area
of this distribution as a convenience.  Windows 7 (and possibly Vista) can
resize their own system partition, which is usually NTFS. In the control
panel, search for "partition": this will lead you to the system

NOTE: If you wish to install OpenBSD on your whole disk, i.e. you do
not want DOS or any other operating system to reside on your hard
disk, you can skip this section and go on to the section that
describes installation, below.  If you're upgrading your system from a
previous release of OpenBSD, you should have proceeded directly to the
section about upgrading; you need none of the information presented
here.

Second, if you are using a disk controller which supports disk geometry
translation, be sure to use the same parameters for OpenBSD as for any
other operating systems installed on the disk.  If you do not, it
will be much harder to make OpenBSD properly coexist with them.  Most
operating systems have utilities that print out the disk geometry they
use; often "fdisk" (or its equivalent) will do this.

Third (but related to the second point above), if you are using a hard
disk with more cylinders than are supported by the other operating
systems or the BIOS, you MUST be sure that all boot partitions start and
end within the area supported by both the BIOS and the OS in question.

The OpenBSD root partition must also reside completely within the BIOS
d11 3
a13 3
Fourth, use the other operating system's "fdisk" program or partition
editor to create at least one of the partitions to be used for that
operating system.  If that operating system is already set up to use the
d15 10
a24 27
partition for it, and then restore the data from that partition.  You do
not have to create an OpenBSD partition at this time; the OpenBSD install-
ation will give you an opportunity to create the partition needed for
OpenBSD.

Finally, do whatever is necessary to restore order to the partition
you took space away from.  If it was a DOS partition, you probably
will need to use "format" to create a new file system on it, and then
restore your important files from your backups.  Other operating
systems will have different needs; most will need to reformat the
partition, and if it was their "main" partition, will probably need
to be reinstalled.

Once you've backed all your data up, there is a tool called fips 2.0
that can shrink your FAT-based DOS/Windows partition to make room for
OpenBSD.  It is included in the MACHINE tools area of this distribution as
a convenience.  It is strongly advised that you read its documentation
and understand the consequences of your actions before using it.  In some
cases, defragmenting your disk and running fips may be much faster than
reinstalling your DOS partition from the backup.

Windows 7 (and possibly Vista) can resize their own system partition, which
is usually NTFS. In the control panel, search for "partition": this will lead
you to the system administration tool. Then right click on the partition you
wish to shrink.  You may have to fiddle with the swap file, because it's
unmoveable, and you might not be able to shrink the partition as much as you
would wish.

- mention you can't install with less than 16MB those days
- hardware list slight updates and precisions
- document correctly which drivers are available on which install media
- mention that the root partition needs to be located in the first 8GB (and
  perhaps a smaller limit on older machines) to boot properly

depending upon the age of the machine and its BIOS.  Due to a limit of the
OpenBSD boot loader, the root partition must be within the first 8G even if
the BIOS supports more.  Note that only the root partition has this issue,
once OpenBSD is loaded, the entire disk is available for use.

@- fix a few typos in the hardware list and update it
- doesn't shout, improve style a bit
- mention you can boot from cd-rom. Really. Yes you can.
- don't support upgrades from prehistoric versions (< 2.0), so don't babble
  about the partition ID change or the so-called new shared libraries
- get more text sync'ed with other arches
And with the help of mickey@@
- don't mention you can install over NFS, none of the floppies or the cd-rom
  has nfs support

Fourth, use the DOS "fdisk" program or another partition editor to
repartition your hard disk.  Create a partition of at least 40M in
size (preferably much larger), and note its starting offset and its
length (preferably in units of disk sectors or cylinders).  You will
need that information when installing OpenBSD (and if the offset and

you have created the new OpenBSD partition, mark it as having a
partition type of 0xA6 (166, in decimal).  If you used "fdisk" to
partition your disk, you will probably have to use a different
partition editor to mark the partition with the correct type.
