For the i386, OpenBSD 2.0 brings greatly improved performance,
stability, and device support. Emulation for several UN*X and UN*X
like operating systems, including Linux and FreeBSD, has been added.
Many new PCI devices are supported, such as cards based on the AMD
PCnet-PCI Ethernet chip, the Digital DC21x4x family of Ethernet chips,
and the Adaptec AIC7870 SCSI host adapter chip.  Some drivers such as
"ccd" which previously only worked on other ports of OpenBSD now work
on the i386 port.  Though still not known to be entirely stable, the
"ncr" driver for 53c8xx-series SCSI adapters has had substantial bugs
and performance issues resolved.

For the i386, NetBSD 1.0 brings greatly improved performance, stability,
and device support.  To complement the added device drivers, NetBSD
1.0's i386 port has greatly improved device autoconfiguration,
allowing it to correctly find more devices on more machines.  The
final, and perhaps most important point about NetBSD 1.0's i386
support is that it is fully backward compatible with old NetBSD
binaries, so you don't need to recompile all your local programs.
(Note, however, that because of the shared library support, you still
have a lot to gain by doing so.)
