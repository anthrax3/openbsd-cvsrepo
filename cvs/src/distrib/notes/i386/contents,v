@Tweak a few texts to cope with the fact that we ship official OpenBSD CD-ROM
and bootable CD-ROM mini images on some platforms, too. Mention such a mini
image for alpha, consistent spelling of CD-ROM, and a few minor updates not
worth mentioning I had lying in my tree.

@- mention bsd.rd in the release contents, this is an easy way to upgrade
- mention you can't install with less than 16MB those days
- hardware list slight updates and precisions
- document correctly which drivers are available on which install media
- mention that the root partition needs to be located in the first 8GB (and
  perhaps a smaller limit on older machines) to boot properly

this includes some contributions from nick@@ and some feedback from deraadt@@

- mention you can boot from cd-rom. Really. Yes you can.
- don't support upgrades from prehistoric versions (< 2.0), so don't babble
  about the partition ID change or the so-called new shared libraries
- get more text sync'ed with other arches
And with the help of mickey@@
- don't mention you can install over NFS, none of the floppies or the cd-rom
  has nfs support

The i386-specific portion of the OpenBSD 2.3 release is found in the
"i386" subdirectory of the distribution.  That subdirectory is laid
out as follows:

.../2.3/i386/
		INSTALL.i386	Installation notes; this file.

		CKSUM		Output of the cksum(1) and md5(1) programs
		MD5		usable for verification of the correctness
				of downloaded files.

		floppy23.fs	The i386 boot and installation
				floppy; see below.

		*.tar.gz	i386 binary distribution sets;
				see below.

		bsd		A stock GENERIC i386 kernel which
				will be installed on your system
				during the install.

In summary, there is one i386 floppy image called "floppy23.fs" (which
you can copy to a floppy using rawrite.exe or `dd'; as described later
in this document).  This is a bootable install floppy which can be
used both to install and to upgrade OpenBSD to the current version.
It is also useful for maintenance and disaster recovery.  In addition,

Bootable installation/upgrade floppy:
d37 1
a37 60
	This disk contains a file system, is bootable, and has
	enough utilities on board to prepare your hard disk drive
	for OpenBSD and to install the OpenBSD distribution.

	It also holds the utilities needed in order to upgrade a
	system to the current version of OpenBSD.

The OpenBSD/i386 binary distribution sets contain the binaries which
comprise the OpenBSD 2.3 release for the i386.  There are seven binary
distribution sets.  The binary distribution sets can be found in
the "i386" subdirectory of the OpenBSD 2.3 distribution tree,
and are as follows:

	base23	The OpenBSD/i386 2.3 base binary distribution.  You
		MUST install this distribution set.  It contains the
		base OpenBSD utilities that are necessary for the
		system to run and be minimally functional.  It
		includes shared library support, and excludes
		everything described below.
		[ 11.9M gzipped, 33.3M uncompressed ]

	comp23	The OpenBSD/i386 Compiler tools.  All of the tools
		relating to C, C++, and FORTRAN (yes, there are two!).
		This set includes the system include files
		(/usr/include), the linker, the compiler tool chain,
		and the various system libraries (except the shared
		libraries, which are included as part of the base
		set).  This set also includes the manual pages for all
		of the utilities it contains, as well as the system
		call and library manual pages.
		[ 7.3M gzipped, 23.0M uncompressed ]

	etc23	This distribution set contains the system
		configuration files that reside in /etc and in several
		other places.  This set MUST be installed if you are
		installing the system from scratch, but should NOT be
		used if you are upgrading.  (If you are upgrading,
		it's recommended that you get a copy of this set and
		CAREFULLY upgrade your configuration files by hand.)
		[ 93K gzipped, 490K uncompressed ]

	game23	This set includes the games and their manual pages.
		[ 2.7M gzipped, 6.4M uncompressed ]

	man23	This set includes all of the manual pages for the
		binaries and other software contained in the base set.
		Note that it does not include any of the manual pages
		that are included in the other sets.
		[ 2.5M gzipped, 9.4M uncompressed ]

	misc23	This set includes the system dictionaries (which are
		rather large), the typesettable document set, and
		man pages for other architectures which happen to be
		installed from the source tree by default.
		[ 1.7M gzipped, 5.8M uncompressed ]

	text23	This set includes OpenBSD's text processing tools,
		including groff, all related programs, and their
		manual pages.
		[ 944K gzipped, 3.3M uncompressed ]
d39 1
a39 2
	xbase23 This set includes the base X distribution.  This includes
		programs, headers, libraries, configuration files.

The i386 binary distribution sets are distributed in the same form as
the source distribution sets; catted together, the members of a set
form a gzipped tar file.  Each i386 binary distribution set also has
its own "CKSUMS" file, just as the source distribution sets do.

The instructions given for extracting the source sets work equally
well for the binary sets, but it is worth noting that if you use that
method, the files are extracted "below" the current directory.  That
is, if you want to extract the binaries "into" your system, i.e.
replace the system binaries with them, you have to run the "tar xfp"
from /.  Also note that if you upgrade or install this way, those
programs that you are using at the time will NOT be replaced.  If you
follow the normal installation or upgrade procedures, this will be
taken care of for you.

kernel-copy floppies, one is an installation floppy, and one is an

Bootable Kernel-copy floppies:

	These disks contain file systems, are bootable, and have
	enough utilities on board to copy a new kernel to your hard
	disk once you have it partitioned for OpenBSD.  They make
	upgrading to a new kernel easy, because all you have to do is
	get a new kernel-copy floppy with a new kernel, boot from it,
	and confirm that you want to have the kernel copied to your
	disk.

        Please note that because of space considerations the kernel
        copy floppies no longer contain drivers that are not needed
        during installation -- in particular, no drivers needed to run
        the X Window System are available in these kernels. It is
        recommended that you configure a custom kernel following
        installation.

        For those that cannot configure a custom kernel, a "generic"
        kernel image, named "bsd.gz" has been placed in the binaries
	directory.  It is strongly encouraged that you build a custom
        kernel for your installation rather than use a prebuilt generic
        kernel.

Installation floppy:

	This disk contains the software necessary to prepare your hard
	drive for OpenBSD and install the OpenBSD distribution. It is
	not bootable, and must be used in conjunction with one of the
	kernel-copy floppies.  This floppy is named "inst-21.fs".

	There are two different kernel copy floppy images,
        "kcadp11.fs", and "kcoth11.fs".  They are identical except
        that the kcadp floppy has the drivers for the supported Adaptec SCSI
        controllers -- the Adaptec 1520, 1522, 1540, 1542, 1740, 1742, 1744,
        and 2940 SCSI host adapters and the AIC6x60 and AIC7870 chips on 
	motherboards or other brands of SCSI controllers -- and does not
        contain the drivers for any other SCSI host adapters, which
        are in the kernel on the kcoth floppy.  (The kernels on the install
        disks are otherwise identical.)

d42 3
a44 9
        For those that cannot configure a custom kernel, two "generic"
        kernel images, named "bsd-adp.gz" and "bsd-oth.gz", have
        been placed in the binaries directory. These are identical
        except that "bsd-adp.gz" contains support for Adaptec SCSI
        controllers, but no other SCSI controllers, and
        "bsd-oth.gz" contains support only for SCSI controllers
        other than the Adaptec. (These are similar in nature to the
        kernels on the kernel copy floppies but with additional device
        support.) It is strongly encouraged that you build a custom

comprise the OpenBSD 1.1 release for the i386.  There are seven binary
distribution sets, and the "security" distribution set.  The binary
distribution sets can be found in subdirectories of the "i386/binary"
subdirectory of the OpenBSD 1.1 distribution tree, and are as follows:
d68 1
a68 1
	base11	The OpenBSD/i386 1.1 base binary distribution.  You

	text11	This set includes OpenBSD's text processing tools,
a114 13

The i386 security distribution set is named "secr11" and can be found
in the "i386/security" subdirectory of the OpenBSD 1.1 distribution
tree.  It contains crypt.c (the source file for the DES encryption
algorithm) and the binaries which depend on it, as well as the "bdes"
DES encryption program.  You do not need this distribution set to use
encrypted passwords in your password file; the "base11" distribution
includes a crypt library which can perform only the decryption function.
The "secr11" distribution set can be found only on those sites which
carry the complete OpenBSD distribution and which can legally obtain it.
(Remember, because of United States law, this distribution set may not be
exported to locations outside of the United States and Canada.)
