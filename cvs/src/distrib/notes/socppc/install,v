@Jumbo commit for 4.7 installation instructions:
- do not mention tape as an installation media on systems where it is very
  unlikely that a tape drive can be connected to (i.e. anything with only
  USB as expansion capabilities)
- do not mention that fetching the installation sets from a partition is
  ``for upgrades only''. You may do this for installation, but of course
  you can not use a partition which will be newfs'ed for that purpose.
- mention ext2fs partitions as possible installation sets source only on
  platforms where the installation media actually can mount an ext2fs
  filesystem.
- stress the fact that the sparc miniroot image is a GENERIC kernel with
  a little on-disk filesystem, and not a RAMDISK kernel with a little
  in-memory filesystem, and thus must not be overwritten during installation
  (i.e. be careful if you repartition the disk the miniroot has been put on).
- more conv=sync -> conv=osync for tape setup instructions.
- model-specific layout changes on armish, loongson and socppc instructions.
- fix various typos and grammar mistaeks.

@Try to catch up with installer changes in the installation notes.
Also, the per-platform features are moved to a common place, which makes
the MD layout easier to work on. m4.common is still a tangled mess of subtly
placed dnl, though...

	Next you will have to edit or create a disk label for the disk
	OpenBSD is being installed on.  If there are any existing
	partitions defined (for any operating system), and a disk label
	is not found, you will first be given an opportunity to run
	fdisk and create an OpenBSD partition.

	If fdisk is being invoked on your behalf, it will start by
	displaying the current partitions defined and then allow you
	to modify this information, add new partitions and change
	which partition to boot from by default.  If you make a mistake,
	you will be allowed to repeat this procedure as necessary to
	correct this.  Note that you should make OpenBSD be the active
	partition at least until the install has been completed.

	You will next be asked for your terminal type.  If you are
	installing from a non-serial console, the default of "vt220"
	is correct.  If you are installing from a serial console
	you should choose the terminal type from amongst those listed.
	(If your terminal type is xterm, just use vt220.)

@Better description of the installation steps:
- document questions in proper order: hostname before network configuration,
  DNS only if network is configured, sshd and ntpd, aperture only on
  machines which need it, serial console only on machines which need it.
  This is done by splitting the end of OpenBSDCommonURL in various
  macros, OpenBSDInstallWrapup, OpenBSDInstallAperture, OpenBSDInstallConsole
  and OpenBSDInstallWrapupPart2.
- use the above macros when appropriate, OpenBSDInstallWrapup* being
  mandatory on all arches.
- remove serial console configuration blurb on sparc and sparc64, it is
  handled by OpenBSDInstallConsole now.

	Note that all OpenBSD partitions in the disk label must have an
	offset that makes it start within the OpenBSD part of the disk,
	and a size that keeps it inside of that portion of the disk.  This
	is within the bounds of the 'c' partition if the disk is not being
	shared with other operating systems, and within the OpenBSD fdisk
	partition if the disk is being shared.
