OpenBSDInstallPrelude

An OpenBSD/palm installation will use the PalmOS to bootstrap itself.
Although this has be done manually, upon each reboot.

After the SD card and USB hub have been setup, reset the device, wait
until it's finished booting.

Hit the reset button on the device, wait till it reboots, pop in the SD
card with bootloader and kernel, run 'Cocoboot' and hit the 'Boot'
button.

        Please keep in mind that upon resetting the device the clock will
        be reset too. Even if you correctly set the time in PalmOS,
        OpenBSD will not pick this up. So it is strongly advised to use
        ntpd(1).

@Jumbo commit for 4.7 installation instructions:
- do not mention tape as an installation media on systems where it is very
  unlikely that a tape drive can be connected to (i.e. anything with only
  USB as expansion capabilities)
- do not mention that fetching the installation sets from a partition is
  ``for upgrades only''. You may do this for installation, but of course
  you can not use a partition which will be newfs'ed for that purpose.
- mention ext2fs partitions as possible installation sets source only on
  platforms where the installation media actually can mount an ext2fs
  filesystem.
- stress the fact that the sparc miniroot image is a GENERIC kernel with
  a little on-disk filesystem, and not a RAMDISK kernel with a little
  in-memory filesystem, and thus must not be overwritten during installation
  (i.e. be careful if you repartition the disk the miniroot has been put on).
- more conv=sync -> conv=osync for tape setup instructions.
- model-specific layout changes on armish, loongson and socppc instructions.
- fix various typos and grammar mistaeks.
