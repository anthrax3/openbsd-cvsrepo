The default configuration of the MACHINE systems comes with a Linux
installation on the disk (either an IDE hard drive, or a CompactFlash
card). At the moment, there is no known way to log in this installation
as ``root'' or interrupt the boot process, and start an OpenBSD
installation procedure.

Because of this, the only way to boot the OpenBSD install is to copy
the miniroot "miniroot{:--:}OSrev.fs" image to the hard drive or CompactFlash
(on the other hand, upgrades can be started by copying bsd.rd to the
 OpenBSD disk and booting from it).

As a result, you will need another machine to plug the machine's disk
or CompactFlash in. Any machine type will do, as long as it supports
ATA-compatible storage devices, regardless of the partition scheme
it uses. Under OpenBSD, it will appear as a ``wd'' device, for example
``wd1''.

Use the dd(1) utility to copy the miniroot to the hard drive.
The command would likely be, under OpenBSD:
	dd if=miniroot{:--:}OSrev.fs of=/dev/rwd1c
Replace ``rwd1c'' with the appropriate device name for the raw device
on the system used to do the copy.

If the machine has a hard drive, and you had to change jumpers on it
to change its ``master'' status, do not forget to configure it back
to ``master'' or ``single drive'', as slave drives are not bootable.

dnl I need to write a comprehensive text, also explaining that Rx/Tx
dnl are swapped between the CF and HD models.
In addition to the disk preparation, you will need to connect a serial
port connector to the machine. Please refer to the OpenBSD/MACHINE
page at
	https://www.OpenBSD.org/MACHINE.html
for more information.

@Jumbo commit for 4.7 installation instructions:
- do not mention tape as an installation media on systems where it is very
  unlikely that a tape drive can be connected to (i.e. anything with only
  USB as expansion capabilities)
- do not mention that fetching the installation sets from a partition is
  ``for upgrades only''. You may do this for installation, but of course
  you can not use a partition which will be newfs'ed for that purpose.
- mention ext2fs partitions as possible installation sets source only on
  platforms where the installation media actually can mount an ext2fs
  filesystem.
- stress the fact that the sparc miniroot image is a GENERIC kernel with
  a little on-disk filesystem, and not a RAMDISK kernel with a little
  in-memory filesystem, and thus must not be overwritten during installation
  (i.e. be careful if you repartition the disk the miniroot has been put on).
- more conv=sync -> conv=osync for tape setup instructions.
- model-specific layout changes on armish, loongson and socppc instructions.
- fix various typos and grammar mistaeks.

To be able to boot the OpenBSD/MACHINE installation program, you will
need to prepare the CF or harddrive in another machine.  Note this will
destroy any previous hard disk content.
