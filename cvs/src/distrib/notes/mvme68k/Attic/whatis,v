@Retire hp300, mvme68k and mvme88k ports. These ports have no users, keeping
this hardware alive is becoming increasingly difficult, and I should heed the
message sent by the three disks which have died on me over the last few days.

Noone sane will mourn these ports anyway. So long, and thanks for the fish.

OpenBSD/MACHINE OSREV was written under contract for Willowglen Singapore
for an embedded application.  Theo de Raadt, Dale Rahn, Chuck Cranor,
and Steve Murphree were involved in working on this port which runs on
the MVME147, MVME162, MVME167, MVME177, and perhaps other models also.

@Your average close-to-release distrib/notes/FOO update.
This time:
- update hardware list, reorganize it more logically
- gets most of the bsd.rd description and instructions on par with other
  arches
- document hov to create a boot tape, and how to boot via s-records
- tries to be more verbose about board setup

This is still way too concise. If you write english better than me (trivial)
and know mvme68k a bit, you're welcome to help fill the blanks.

At least this is better than the existing instructions, and deraadt@@ agrees.
