@Retire hp300, mvme68k and mvme88k ports. These ports have no users, keeping
this hardware alive is becoming increasingly difficult, and I should heed the
message sent by the three disks which have died on me over the last few days.

Noone sane will mourn these ports anyway. So long, and thanks for the fish.

OpenBSD/MACHINE OSREV runs on the following classes of machines:
	- MVME141 - Motorola with 68030 and 68882, with VSB interface
	- MVME147 - Motorola with 68030 and 68882
	- MVME162 - Motorola with 68040 and IndustryPack slots
	- MVME165 - Motorola with 68040, with VSB interface
	- MVME167 - Motorola with 68040
dnl 172 support is not tested
	- MVME172 - Motorola with 68060 and IndustryPack slots
	- MVME177 - Motorola with 68060

12MB of RAM should be sufficient to boot and a minimal system can probably
be squeezed onto a 250MB disk by installing only the `base' and `etc' sets.
However, a minimum of 16MB is necessary for the system not to be swap-bound,
with 32MB or more being recommended for serious usage of the system.
Note that until you have at least 32MB of RAM, getting more RAM is more
important than getting a faster CPU board.

Supported devices {:-include-:}:

MVME141:
	memory:
		both VME and VSB boards are supported, such as MVME224 boards
	serial ports:
		on-board ttyd0-ttyd1 - MC68681 (dart)
	VMEbus:
		supported

MVME147:
	serial ports:
		on-board ttya-ttyd (zs)
	Ethernet:
		on-board AMD 7990 Lance Ethernet (le)
	SCSI:
		on-board WD33C93 controller (wdsc)
	VMEbus:
		partially supported (some cards have issues)

MVME165:
	serial ports:
		on-board ttyd0 - ttyd1 - MC68681 (dart)
	VMEbus:
		supported

MVME162, MVME172:
	serial ports:
		on-board ttya-ttyd - Zilog Z85230 SCC (zs)
	Ethernet:
		on-board Intel 82596CA Ethernet (ie)
	SCSI:
		on-board NCR53c710 controller (osiop)
	VMEbus:
		drivers for short I/O access (untested)
	Flash:
		1MB flash, either Intel 28F008SA or 28F020
		A driver is available, but doesn't work correctly.
		Jumper GPIO3 selects Flash memory map and must
		be installed for booting with the Flash driver (default)
	SRAM:
		supported
	IndustryPack:
		untested

MVME167, MVME177:
	serial ports:
		on-board tty00 - tty03 - Cirrus Logic CD2401 (cl)
	Ethernet:
		on-board Intel 82596CA Ethernet (ie)
	SCSI:
		on-board NCR53c710 controller (osiop)
	SRAM:
		supported
	VMEbus:

Faithful clones of the above boards should also work.

Additional VMEbus devices:

	MVME327A SCSI and floppy Controller (vsbic), currently limited
	    to the SCSI interface only
	MVME328 High Performance SCSI Controller (vs)
dnl	MVME332XT High Performance Serial I/O Controller (vx)
	MVME376 Ethernet Communications Controller (le)

@Your average close-to-release distrib/notes/FOO update.
This time:
- update hardware list, reorganize it more logically
- gets most of the bsd.rd description and instructions on par with other
  arches
- document hov to create a boot tape, and how to boot via s-records
- tries to be more verbose about board setup

This is still way too concise. If you write english better than me (trivial)
and know mvme68k a bit, you're welcome to help fill the blanks.

At least this is better than the existing instructions, and deraadt@@ agrees.
