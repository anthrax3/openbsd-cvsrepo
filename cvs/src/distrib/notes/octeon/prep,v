@Document some installation quirks for the EdgeRouter Lite in INSTALL.octeon:
How to deal with USB sticks which are not detected during power up.
How to enable both CPU cores (this also applies to other octeon SMP systems).

By default MACHINE systems are shipped with a Linux (or proprietary) system
installated on the CompactFlash card or USB drive.

First connect your computer via serial port to the device (you may need to use
a Cisco serial cable depending on your hardware) with a command such as
"cu -l cuaU0 -s 115200" (assuming cuaU0 is your serial port device). Now apply
power to the device and start it.

Unless you have removed or changed the Linux installation it will be booted
automatically. If you are quick you can interrupt booting (while still in
U-Boot) with ^C.

There are several ways to load an OpenBSD/MACHINE kernel (or ramdisk),
over TFTP, from the internal CompactFlash or USB storage.

Booting from a CF card or USB:

  To use the miniroot image you will need another machine to plug the
  SD card in to. Any machine type will do, as long as it supports SD card
  storage devices.  Under OpenBSD, it will appear as a ``sd'' device, for
  example sd1.
  
  Use the dd(1) utility to copy the miniroot to the hard drive.
  The command would likely be, under OpenBSD:

  	dd if=miniroot{:--:}OSrev.fs of=/dev/rsd1c

  On the EdgeRouter Lite, some USB storage devices are not detected
  immediately after power on:

    USB:   (port 0) scanning bus for devices... 
          USB device not responding, giving up (status=0)
    1 USB Devices found
           scanning bus for storage devices...
    No device found. Not initialized?

  In such cases, manually resetting the usb controller may help:
  
    Octeon ubnt_e100# usb reset

  Now load the ramdisk kernel using either of the following commands depending
  on the medium used. For USB:
  
    Octeon ubnt_e100# fatload usb 0 $loadaddr bsd.rd
  
  For Compact Flash use:

    # fatload ide 0:1 ${loadaddr} bsd.rd

Booting over the network:

  For TFTP you will first need to setup a TFTP server as described in
  diskless(8). Assuming tftpd(8) chroots into /tftpboot, copy bsd.rd into that
  directory.

  Power on your OpenBSD/MACHINE device and from the U-Boot prompt set up
  networking. In this example it is assumed you have a DHCP server in your
  network:

	# dhcp

  If you don't have a DHCP server, you need to set the ipaddr U-Boot environment
  variable:

	# setenv ipaddr <static ip address>

  Now set the IP address of your TFTP server:

	# setenv serverip <server ip>

  The ramdisk kernel needs to be loaded into memory. If you use "0" as the
  address, the default address location will be used by U-Boot:

	# tftpboot 0 bsd.rd
	Using octeth0 device
	TFTP from server 192.168.178.30; our IP address is 192.168.178.89
	Filename 'bsd.rd'.
	Load address: 0x9f00000
	Loading: #########################
	done
	Bytes transferred = 7191474 (6dbbb2 hex), 8617 Kbytes/sec

Booting the installation kernel

  Now the kernel can be booted from the default memory location, with no
  arguments provided:

	# bootoctlinux

  On dual-core systems, boot with both CPU cores enabled:

	# bootoctlinux rootdev=rd0 coremask=0x3

@Recommend cu instead of tip in the INSTALL prep notes

As well as using a USB serial device in the example.

"cu in general works better on various systems" -- deraadt
"cu is more predictable across platforms" -- dlg

Ok from maja, tedu, bmercer, jj. "I like it" from deraadt

First commit is in documentation, that must be sign of something.
Thanks to everyone for making me feel welcome.

is by using TFTP to load bsd.rd.
