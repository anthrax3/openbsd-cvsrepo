The following machines are targeted by OpenBSD/MACHINE:

	Portwell CAM-0100
	  onboard serial port, CompactFlash and Ethernet are supported;
	  it's possible to install OpenBSD/MACHINE on this machine with
	  some effort.

	Ubiquiti Networks EdgeRouter Lite / PoE
	  onboard serial port, Ethernet and USB controller are supported.

	D-Link DSR-500
	  onboard serial port, Ethernet and USB controller are supported;
	  it's possible to boot OpenBSD/MACHINE on this machine over NFS.
	  The onboard CompactFlash is not yet supported.

	  onboard serial port and Ethernet are supported; it's possible
	  to boot OpenBSD/MACHINE on this machine over NFS. The onboard
	  CompactFlash is not yet supported which, together with the
	  lack of USB support, means that there is no local storage
	  available at the moment for this model.

@Delete horrifically out of data add-on-peripheral lists; there are other
places to check for this information, or trial and error, with error
resulting in things getting fixed.  Scary false warnings don't help anyone.
Unmaintainable lists are always unmaintained.

@The D-Link DSR-500 model is partially supported now.

Local storage support is still work in progress, thus currently
missing.

Reminded to commit this by a similar but not as complete diff from

@The ERL Ethernet is supported now and can be booted over NFS. Reflect that

	  at the moment little hardware is supported by OpenBSD/MACHINE
	  on this machine. There is no USB support yet, which means that
	  there is no storage (no onboard CompactFlash), and Ethernet
	  isn't supported either.
