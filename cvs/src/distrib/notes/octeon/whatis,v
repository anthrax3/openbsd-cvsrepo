OpenBSD/MACHINE is a port intended to run on systems based upon the
Cavium Octeon and Octeon PLUS MIPS64 CPUs. OpenBSD/MACHINE initially
aims to provide support for the Portwell CAM-0100, Ubiquiti Networks
EdgeRouter LITE / PoE and D-Link DSR-500.

@drop paragraph saying there are no install sets and that one needs to
cross compile.

At this moment no installation sets or bootloader is available, thus the
kernel and ramdisk need to be cross-compiled (or compiled on OpenBSD/sgi).
For the installation sets the sets from OpenBSD/sgi can be used.
