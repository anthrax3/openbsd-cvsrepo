Installation is supported from several media types, including:

	CD-ROM
	FFS partitions
	DOS (FAT) partitions
dnl	EXT2 partitions
dnl	Remote NFS partition
	HTTP

If you can't (or don't want to) boot off a CD-ROM, you can use a floppy
disk (1.44MB required) or a USB key.  Failing that, if your computer supports
PXE, you can prepare a server to start the install across the network, but you
will still need the install sets available on one of the above media types.

Creating a PXE network bootable setup using OpenBSD or other Un*x-like system:

	In order to start the install via PXE, you will need to set up a
	DHCP server and a TFTP server.  The details of how to do this
	vary considerably, depending on the network's host.  You should
	refer to the relevant man pages or administrator's guide for the
	host system.

	The DHCP server should return "pxeboot" to MACHINE clients as the
	network boot program.  Both pxeboot and the bsd.rd install kernel
	should be copied to the TFTP server's root directory.

	If you are using an OpenBSD server, you can use the supplied
	dhcpd and tftpd.  A sample configuration for dhcpd is given in
	the pxeboot(8) man page.  You can get it from the man{:--:}OSrev.tgz
	distribution set, or see the copy on the OpenBSD web page.  You
	should also refer to dhcpd(8) and tftpd(8) for more information
	on configuring them.

@Jumbo commit for 4.7 installation instructions:
- do not mention tape as an installation media on systems where it is very
  unlikely that a tape drive can be connected to (i.e. anything with only
  USB as expansion capabilities)
- do not mention that fetching the installation sets from a partition is
  ``for upgrades only''. You may do this for installation, but of course
  you can not use a partition which will be newfs'ed for that purpose.
- mention ext2fs partitions as possible installation sets source only on
  platforms where the installation media actually can mount an ext2fs
  filesystem.
- stress the fact that the sparc miniroot image is a GENERIC kernel with
  a little on-disk filesystem, and not a RAMDISK kernel with a little
  in-memory filesystem, and thus must not be overwritten during installation
  (i.e. be careful if you repartition the disk the miniroot has been put on).
- more conv=sync -> conv=osync for tape setup instructions.
- model-specific layout changes on armish, loongson and socppc instructions.
- fix various typos and grammar mistaeks.
