@Remove OpenBSD/pegaos, this has been announced before but delayed until
the tree was stable. No point in code supporting a company which screws
its employees being in the OpenBSD tree.

To be able to boot the OpenBSD/MACHINE installation program, you will
need to acquire some limited knowledge of OpenFirmware, the low-level
process that controls the microprocessor after hardware initialization
and diagnostics are performed but before control is handed to the
operating system.

dnl XXX Improve Pegasos-specific details

Important Open Firmware command examples:

boot cd:OFWBOOT /OSREV/MACHINE/bsd.rd (on Pegasos I)
boot cd OFWBOOT /OSREV/MACHINE/bsd.rd (on Pegasos II)
		(boot from an appropriately prepared
		OpenBSD CD in the CD/DVD drive)

boot net:ofwboot /bsd.rd (on Pegasos I)
boot net ofwboot /bsd.rd (on Pegasos II)
		(netboot from a pre-configured bootp/tftp/nfs
		server containing the "ofwboot" and "bsd.rd"
		files at the root directory of the TFTP server)

boot /dev/pci/ide/disk@@0,0:3,ofwboot /bsd /bsd
		(After installation, boot /bsd from the primary
		 device on the first ATA bus. On Pegasos I, the /bsd
		 needs to be specified TWICE because OpenFirmware seems
		 to lose the first argument)

printenv	(print current machine variables)
setenv		(set a machine variable)
devalias	(list device aliases; useful for locating other
		devices in the machine such as hard drives etc)

Other Open Firmware command examples:

setenv auto-boot? false
		(force the machine to wait at Open Firmware
		for user input at next reboot; options are true/false)

devalias hd /pci/ide/disk
		Create a devalias so that booting is simplified

setenv boot-device hd:3,ofwboot
		(force the machine to boot into OpenBSD
		automatically at next reboot)

dev /		(change to root level of the device tree)
pwd		(show current location in the device tree)
ls		(show items at current location in the device tree)
words		(show methods of items at current location in the device
		tree)
.properties	(show properties of items at current location in the
		device tree)

Autobooting OpenBSD/MACHINE

It is possible to automatically boot into OpenBSD
by setting up the following:

setenv auto-boot? true
setenv boot-device hd:3,ofwboot

These settings assume that the master of the first IDE bus has OpenBSD
installed on it, in MBR format.  It is not necessary to specify '/bsd'
on the boot line or in the boot-device variable, since it is the
default.

Sharing a disk with MorphOS:
It is not currently possible to share a disk with MorphOS; Amiga labeled
disks are recognized, but can't be modified to define new partitions at the
moment.

OpenBSD/MACHINE is capable of booting from a dedicated disk using a
MBR partitioned disk, a CD containing an ISO image, or a firmware supported
Ethernet card.

For dedicated disks, the MACHINE port boots off a boot program in
the FFS 'a' filesystem. This is set up by the install program
and no special setup is required.
