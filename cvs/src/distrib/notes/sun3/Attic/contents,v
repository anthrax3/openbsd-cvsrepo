used to install OpenBSD onto a completely "bare" sun3.  The files
in the `.../install' directory are described below:

	miniroot.gz	A gzipped copy of the miniroot filesystem.
			This image is to be un-gzipped and copied
			into the swap area of a disk.

	bsd-rd.gz	A gzipped copy of the "RAMDISK kernel"
			for installing the miniroot filesystem.

	bsd-gen.gz	A gzipped GENERIC kernel (for upgrade)

	netboot		A copy of the network boot program.
			This is useful if you are installing

The sun3-specific portion of the OpenBSD 2.3 release is found in the

out as follows:

The OpenBSD/sun3 binary distribution sets contain the binaries which
comprise the OpenBSD 2.3 release for the sun3.  There are seven binary
distribution sets.  The binary distribution sets can be found in
the "sun3" subdirectory of the OpenBSD 2.3 distribution tree,
and are as follows:

	base23	The OpenBSD/sun3 2.3 base binary distribution.  You
		MUST install this distribution set.  It contains the
		base OpenBSD utilities that are necessary for the
		system to run and be minimally functional.  It
		includes shared library support, and excludes
		everything described below.
		[ 7.2M gzipped, 19M uncompressed ]

	comp23	The OpenBSD/sun3 Compiler tools.  All of the tools
		relating to C and C++.  This set includes the system
		include files (/usr/include), the linker, the compiler
		tool chain, and the various system libraries (except
		the shared libraries, which are included as part of the
		base set).  This set also includes the manual pages for
		all of the utilities it contains, as well as the system
		call and library manual pages.
		[ 4.6M gzipped, 14.7M uncompressed ]

	etc23	This distribution set contains the system configuration
		files that reside in /etc and in several other places.
		This set MUST be installed if you are installing the
		system from scratch, but should NOT be used if you are
		upgrading.  (If you are upgrading, it's recommended that
		you get a copy of this set and CAREFULLY upgrade your
		configuration files by hand.)
		[ 64K gzipped, 348K uncompressed ]

	games23	This set includes the games and their manual pages.
		[ 2.8M gzipped, 6.8M uncompressed ]

	man23	This set includes all of the manual pages for the
		binaries and other software contained in the base set.
		Note that it does not include any of the manual pages
		that are included in the other sets.
		[ 850K gzipped, 3.3M uncompressed ]

	misc23	This set includes the system dictionaries (which are
		rather large), the typesettable document set, and
		man pages for other architectures which happen to be
		installed from the source tree by default.
		[ 1.8M gzipped, 6.5M uncompressed ]

	text23	This set includes OpenBSD's text processing tools,
		including groff, all related programs, and their
		manual pages.
		[ 770K gzipped, 2.8M uncompressed ]

The sun3 binary distribution sets are distributed as gzipped tar files.
Each sun3 binary distribution set also has its own "CKSUMS" file, just
as the source distribution sets do.

The instructions given for extracting the source sets work equally
well for the binary sets, but it is worth noting that if you use that
method, the files are extracted "below" the current directory.  That
is, if you want to extract the binaries "into" your system, i.e.
replace the system binaries with them, you have to run the "tar xvfp"
from /.  Also note that if you upgrade or install this way, those
programs that you are using at the time will NOT be replaced.  If you
follow the normal installation or upgrade procedures, this will be
taken care of for you.

tree.  It contains executables which are built in the "src/domestic" portion
if the OpenBSD source tree.  It can only be found on those sites which carry

because of United States law, this distribution set may not be exported to
locations outside of the United States and Canada.)
