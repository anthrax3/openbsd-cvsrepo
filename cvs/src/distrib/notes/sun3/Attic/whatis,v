OpenBSD OSREV is the second release of OpenBSD for the sun3,
including a full set of binaries.  This binary distribution is
referred to elsewhere in this document by the name OpenBSD/sun3.

This release offers the following features:

* Native boot programs for disk, network, and tape
* Automated installation tools (using a "miniroot")
* SCSI driver supporting DMA, interrupts, and
  disconnect/reselect with SCSI-2 devices (optional)
* Frame buffer drivers for bwtwo, cgtwo, cgfour,
  all compatible with SunOS and the X Window System
* Support for the Virtually Addressed Cache (VAC) on
  Sun3/260 models (and vastly improved performance)
* SMD disk drivers
* SunOS 4.1 compatibility (runs most Sun3 applications)
* Supports most SCSI devices (CD-ROM, etc)
* Diskless boot capability
