@Installation is supported from several media types, including:

	CD-ROM (with PROM versions >= 3.0)
	FFS partitions
	Tape
	Remote NFS partition
	FTP
	HTTP

However, you can only boot the installation procedure from disk, tape or
network. This requires some setup work to prepare a bootable image,
either a tape, or a compatible net boot server.

Although you can access the distribution sets directly from one of the
FTP mirrors over the internet, you may wish to transfer the sets to a
local FTP or NFS server, or copy them to a partition on the target
system's disk or onto a SCSI tape.


Creating a bootable hard disk using SunOS or other Un*x-like system:

	You can copy the miniroot image "miniroot{:--:}OSrev.fs" onto
	the hard disk you intend to boot on.  Traditionally, the
	way to do this is to use dd(1) to place the bootable filesystem
	image in the "swap" partition of the disk (while running in
	single user mode), and then booting from that partition.

	Using the "b" partition allows you to boot without overwriting
	any useful parts of the disk. You can also use another partition,
	but don't use the "a" or "c" partition without understanding
	the disklabel issues described below under "incompatible systems".

	This requires that you are running SunOS, Solaris, OpenBSD or NetBSD
	which have a compatible view of SunOS disk labels and partitions.

	Use the dd(1) utility to copy the file to the hard drive.
	Under SunOS, the command would be:

		dd if=miniroot{:--:}OSrev.fs of=/dev/rsd0b bs=36b

	The blocksize is arbitrary as long as it's a multiple of 512-bytes
	and within the maximum supported by the driver, i.e. bs=126b may
	not work for all cases.  Again, device/partition names may vary,
	depending on the OS involved.


Creating a network bootable setup using SunOS or other Un*x-like system:

	The details of setting up a network bootable environment vary
	considerably, depending on the networks host.  Extract the
	OpenBSD diskless(8) man page from the man{:--:}OSrev.tgz distribution
	set or see the copy on the OpenBSD web page.  You will also
	need to reference the relevant man pages or administrators guide
	for the host system.
	
	Basically, you will need to set up reverse-arp (rarpd) and boot
	parameter (bootpd) information and make the OpenBSD bootblock,
	kernel/miniroot partition, and a swap file available as required
	by the netboot setup.

The steps necessary to prepare the distribution sets for installation
depend on which method of installation you choose.  Some methods
require a bit of setup first that is explained below.

The installation allows installing OpenBSD directly from FTP mirror
sites over the internet, however you must consider the speed and
reliability of your internet connection for this option.  It may save
much time and frustration to use ftp get/reget to transfer the
distribution sets to a local server or disk and perform the installation
from there, rather than directly from the internet.


To install or upgrade OpenBSD using a tape, you need to do the following:

	To install OpenBSD from a tape, you need to make a tape that
	contains the distribution set files, each in "tar" format or
	in "gzipped tar format".  First you will need to transfer the
	distribution sets to your local system, using ftp.  Then you
	need to make a tape containing the files.

	If you're making the tape on a UN*X-like system, the easiest way
	to do so is make a shell script along the following lines, call it
	"/tmp/maketape".

	#! /bin/sh
	tape=/dev/nrst0
	mt -f ${tape} rewind
	if test $# -lt 1
	then
		for file in tapeboot bsd.rd
		do
			dd if=${file} of=${tape} obs=8k conv=sync
		done
	fi
	for file in base etc comp game man misc
	do
		dd if=${file}OSrev.tgz of=${tape} obs=8k conv=sync
	done
	tar cf ${tape} bsd
	mt -f ${tape} offline
	# end of script


	And then:

	cd .../OSREV/MACHINE
	sh -x /tmp/maketape

	
	Note that this script creates a bootable tape. If you only want to
	fetch the OpenBSD files from tape, but want to boot from another
	device, you can save time and space creating the tape this way:

	cd .../OSREV/MACHINE
	sh -x /tmp/maketape noboot

	
	If you're using a system other than OpenBSD or SunOS, the tape
	name and other requirements may change.

To install OpenBSD using a remote partition, mounted via
NFS, you must do the following:
d67 1
a67 40
	NOTE:	This method of installation is recommended only for
		those already familiar with using BSD network
		configuration and management commands.  If you aren't,
		this documentation should help, but is not intended to
		be all-encompassing.

	Place the OpenBSD distribution sets you wish to install into a
	directory on an NFS server, and make that directory mountable
	by the machine on which you are installing or upgrading OpenBSD.
	This will probably require modifying the /etc/exports file
	of the NFS server and resetting its mount daemon (mountd).
	(Both of these actions will probably require superuser
	privileges on the server.)

	You need to know the numeric IP address of the NFS server,
	and, if the server is not on a network directly connected to
	the machine on which you're installing or upgrading OpenBSD,
	you need to know the numeric IP address of the router closest
	to the OpenBSD machine.  Finally, you need to know the numeric
	IP address of the OpenBSD machine itself.

	Once the NFS server is set up properly and you have the
	information mentioned above, you can proceed to the next step
	in the installation or upgrade process.  If you're installing
	OpenBSD from scratch, go to the section on preparing your hard
	disk, below.  If you're upgrading an existing installation, go
	directly to the section on upgrading.

If you are upgrading OpenBSD, you also have the option of installing
OpenBSD by putting the new distribution sets somewhere in your existing
file system, and using them from there.  To do that, you must do the
following:

	Place the distribution sets you wish to upgrade somewhere in
	your current file system tree.  At a bare minimum, you must
	upgrade the "base" binary distribution, and so must put the
	"base{:--:}OSrev" set somewhere in your file system.  If you wish,
	you can do the other sets, as well, but you should NOT upgrade
	the "etc" distribution; the "etc" distribution contains system
	configuration files that you should review and update by hand.
d69 1
a69 2
	Once you have done this, you can proceed to the next step in
	the upgrade process, actually upgrading your system.

Installation is supported from several media types, including:
	* Tape
	* NFS
	* CD-ROM
	* FTP

Note that installing on a "bare" machine requires some bootable
device; either a tape drive or Sun-compatible NFS server.

The procedure for transferring the distribution sets onto
installation media depends on the type of media.  Instructions
for each type of media are given below.

In order to create installation media, you will need all the 
files in these two directories:
	.../OSREV/sun3/install
	.../OSREV/sun3/binary

* Creating boot/install tapes:

Installing from tape is the simplest method of all.
This method uses two tapes; one called the "boot"
tape, and another called the "install" tape.

The boot tape is created as follows:

	cd .../OSREV/sun3/install
	set T = /dev/nrst0
	mt -f $T rewind
	dd if=tapeboot of=$T bs=8k conv=sync
	dd if=bsd-rd of=$T bs=8k conv=sync
	gzip -d < miniroot.gz | dd of=$T bs=8k
	mt -f $T rewind

The install tape is created as follows:

	cd .../OSREV/sun3/install
	set T = /dev/nrst0
	mt -f $T rewind
	foreach f (base etc comp games man misc)
	  gzip -d < $f.gz | dd of=$T bs=8k
	end
	mt -f $T rewind

If the tapes do not work as expected, you may need to explicitly
set the EOF mark at the end of each tape segment.  It may also be
necessary to use the `conv=osync' argument to dd(1).  Note that
this argument is incompatible with the `bs=' argument.  Consult
the tape-related manual pages on the system where the tapes are
created for more details.

* Boot/Install from NFS server:

If your machine has a disk and network connection, but no tape drive,
it may be convenient for you to install OpenBSD over the network.  This
involves temporarily booting your machine over NFS, just long enough
so you can initialize its disk.  This method requires that you have
access to an NFS server on your network so you can configure it to
support diskless boot for your machine.  Configuring the NFS server
is normally a task for a system administrator, and is not trivial.

If you are using a OpenBSD system as the boot-server, have a look at
the diskless(8) manual page for guidelines on how to proceed with
this.  If the server runs another operating system, consult the
documentation that came with it (i.e. add_client(8) on SunOS).

Your Sun3 expects to be able to download a second stage bootstrap
program via TFTP after having acquired its IP address through RARP
when instructed to boot "over the net".  It will look for a filename
derived from the machine's IP address expressed in hexadecimal.  For
example, a sun3 which has been assigned IP address 130.115.144.20
will make an TFTP request for `8273900B'.  Normally, this file is a
symbolic link to the OpenBSD/sun3 "netboot" program, which should be
located in a place where the TFTP daemon can find it (remember, many
TFTP daemons run in a chroot'ed environment).  The netboot program
may be found in the install directory of this distribution.

The netboot program will query a bootparamd server to find the
NFS server address and path name for its root, and then load a
kernel from that location.  The server should have a copy of the
bsd-rd kernel in the root area for your client (no other files
are needed in the client root) and /etc/bootparams on the server
should have an entry for your client and its root directory.
The client will need access to the miniroot image, which can be
provided using NFS or remote shell.  If using NFS, miniroot.gz
must be expanded on the server, because there is no gzip program
in the RAMDISK image.  The unzipped miniroot takes 8MB of space.

If you will be installing OpenBSD on several clients, it may be useful
to know that you can use a single NFS root for all the clients as long
as they only use the bsd-rd kernel.  There will be no conflict
between clients because the RAM-disk kernel will not use the NFS root.
No swap file is needed; the RAM-disk kernel does not use that either.

* Install/Upgrade from CD-ROM:

This method requires that you boot from another device (i.e. tape
or network, as described above).  You may need to make a boot tape
on another machine using the files provided on the CD-ROM.  Once
you have booted bsd-rd (the RAM-disk kernel) and loaded the
miniroot, you can load any of the distribution sets directly from
the CD-ROM.  The "install" program in the miniroot automates the
work required to mount the CD-ROM and extract the files.

* Install/Upgrade via FTP:

This method requires that you boot from another device (i.e. tape
or network, as described above).  You may need to make a boot tape
on another machine using the files in .../install (which you get
via FTP).  Once you have booted bsd-rd (the RAM-disk kernel)
and loaded the miniroot, you can load any of the distribution sets
over the net using FTP.  The "install" program in the miniroot
automates the work required to configure the network interface and
transfer the files.

This method, of course, requires network access to an FTP server.
This might be a local system, or it might even be ftp.OpenBSD.ORG
itself.  If you wish to use ftp.OpenBSD.ORG as your FTP file
server, you may want to keep the following information handy:
