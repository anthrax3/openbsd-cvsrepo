@amiga and sun3 turned out to not be y2k+3 compliant here. Remove them, as
well as the few userland tools which were only used on these platforms.

@OpenBSD/MACHINE OSREV runs on most MACHINE machines, including:
		3/50
		3/60, 3/60LE
		3/75, 3/110, 3/1[4568]0
		3/2[68]0

OpenBSD/MACHINE OSREV does not run on the Sun 3/80 and Sun 3/4x0 (sun3x
class) because the sun3x MMU and other devices are very different.

The minimal configuration requires 4M of RAM and ~80MB of disk space.
To install the entire system requires much more disk space (at least
200MB is recommended, without counting the additional space necessary
for sources or packages). To run X or compile the system, more memory
is recommended. Acceptable performance requires 8MB of RAM, or 16 MB
when running the X Window System.

The following MACHINE hardware is supported:

	Serial ports (RS232):
		built-in ttya, ttyb

	Video adapters:
		bwtwo, cgtwo, cgfour

	Network interfaces:
		On-board Lance Ethernet (le)
		On-board or VME Intel Ethernet (ie)

	SCSI:  (Most SCSI disks, tapes, CD-ROMs, etc.)
		On-board "si" (SCSI-3)
		VME "si" (SCSI-3) board

	SMD Disks Controlers:
		Xylogics 450/451
		Xylogics 750/7053

	Input devices:
		Sun keyboard and mouse

	Miscellaneous:
		Battery-backed real-time clock.

Hardware not listed here is likely to be unsupported by this release.

To install the entire system requires much more disk space (approx.
100MB additional space is necessary for full sources).  To run X

Note 1:
    SMD disk support is almost ready, but could not be tested
    in time for this release.  Drivers are provided for the
    Xylogics 450/451 and Xylogics 753/7053 VME boards only as
    source code.  They compile but have never touched a disk.

    The "si" driver now supports DMA and disconnect/reselect
    but due to the immaturity of the DMA code, those features
    are disabled by default.  To enable DMA (and get faster
    SCSI performance) patch the variable si_options in the
    file /usr/src/sys/arch/sun3/dev/ncr_si.c as indicated.
