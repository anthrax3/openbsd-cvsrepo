	- DEC SGEC (ze)

    * SCSI controllers:
	- NCR 5380 (asc) or NCR 53C9x (ncr) on-board SCSI
	  (this includes most 3100s and VAXstation 4000s, as well
	   as the VAX 4000 10x series)
	- SII (sii) SCSI on VAXstation 35x0 I/O module

    * Frame buffers:
	- VAXstation 3100 on-board monochrome frame buffer (smg)

	  for VAXstation 3100/{30,38,40,48} (lcspx)
	- VAXstation 35x0/38x0 frame buffer (legss), without the 16 planes
	  option

	The VXT2000 monochrome frame buffer, the LEGSS 16 plane option and
	the spxg/spxgt option for VAXstation 4000s are not supported yet.

    * Input devices:
	- LK201 and LK401 keyboards (lkkbd)
	- VSxxx mice and tablets (lkms)

dnl 12MB needs swap during installation, which is a work-in-progress
16MB of RAM should be sufficient to boot and a minimal system can probably
be squeezed onto a 300MB disk by installing only the `base' set.
However, a minimum of 32MB is recommended for serious usage of the system.

Currently, your storage options for using OpenBSD/MACHINE are SCSI disks
or tapes on one of the supported controllers, disks and tapes accessed
through an appropriate QBUS MSCP controller, or an NFS root and swap.
The latter is the only option for the diskless VXT2000 terminals.

The minimal configuration requires 16MB of RAM and at least 300MB of disk
space, by installing only the `base' and `etc' sets. To install the entire
system, at least 800MB is required, and to compile the system, at least 32MB
of RAM is recommended.

@Add support for the ``Firefox'' VAXstation 3520/3540/3820/3840 workstations,
currently limited to serial console and a single processor working.

All ``on-board'' devices, including the Q-bus adapter, but except for
the frame buffer, are supported. The machine will boot over the network
or from SCSI devices.

Lots of thanks to Al Kossow for www.bitsavers.org, on which I found the
technical documentation allowing me to complete this port (which was
lacking at the time I got that machine...).
