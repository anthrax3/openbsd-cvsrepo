@dnl	$OpenBSD: install,v 1.27 2015/03/27 20:55:56 miod Exp $
OpenBSDInstallPrelude({:-MSCP or other non-SCSI disks-:})

For most systems, the easiest way to install OpenBSD/MACHINE OSREV is via
diskless booting over an Ethernet network.  You will need both the
"boot.mop" image and the "bsd.rd" kernel to boot.  You will also need a
machine configured as a rarp, MOP, bootparam, and NFS server.

However, should your VAX support local storage, we provide a floppy sized
image that can be written onto a disk in another machine, and when booted
on the VAX will present you with the standard install prompt. If you used
this method you can skip ahead to the "ready to install OpenBSD" section.

Booting from Network:

In order to bootstrap via the network, you must provide a second system to
act as a boot server. It is convenient if this is a second OpenBSD machine
as the necessary services are already installed, although source code for
such programs as mopd can be found in OpenBSD's source tree, and should be
reasonably portable to other UN*X-like operating systems. More information
on diskless booting can be found in the OpenBSD diskless(8) manual page.

When you turn on your VAX, it will run an extensive and model specific set
of self-diagnostic ROM routines. When it is done, you should see a >>>
prompt (also called the chevron prompt) on the console.  Typing "show dev"
or "show ethernet" to get the VAX Ethernet device's MAC address usually
works; also try "TEST 50" on MicroVAXen 2000 and 3100.

You will need to create an /etc/ethers file on the bootserver.  This file
will be used by rarpd to answer rarp (Ethernet address->IP address) requests.
The format of this file is the Ethernet address followed by the machine
name or address.  Here is an example:

	08:00:2b:24:72:00		quickvax

Note that the server must be able to resolve "quickvax" to the IP address
you intend to use for your new vax system. This can be accomplished by an
entry in /etc/hosts.

Then start rarpd (or configure /etc/rc.conf to always start rarpd).

Copy boot.mop into /tftpboot/mop/1a2b3c4d5e6f.SYS, where "1a2b3c4d5e6f"
represents the six octets of your Ethernet address.  For example, the
filename for the machine described above would be "08002b247200.SYS".
Note that all non alphanumeric characters must be stripped and the
MAC portion must be lower case, the extension upper.  Start mopd by
typing "mopd -a", if you've not configured it to run by default.

Next you need to export a directory for your new machine to mount over
NFS. This is accomplished by adding an entry to /etc/exports such as:

	/export/MACHINE -maproot=root quickvax

In a typical NFS install, the directory `/export/MACHINE' will contain
the ramdisk kernel image `bsd.rd', although it is possible to populate
it with a full VAX filesystem to act as a true NFS root. Ensure that your
server is configured to export NFS properly, and is running nfsd, mountd,
and the rpc portmapper. See the exports(5) manpage for more information.


Finally, you need to add an entry for your MACHINE in /etc/bootparams.
For example:

	quickvax	root=myserver:/export/MACHINE

Enable rpc.bootparamd either by turning it on in /etc/rc.conf and rebooting,
or by running it manually.

You are now ready to mopboot your MACHINE.

Typing "B <DEVICE>", where <DEVICE> is your VAX's Ethernet device, at the
chevron prompt should then load the OpenBSD booter.


Installing using the netboot procedure:

OpenBSDInstallPart2

	Boot your machine from the installation media as described above.

	The OpenBSD bootloader will appear, and a countdown should begin;
	type any key on the console to interrupt and type

		boot bsd.rd

	It will take a while to load the kernel especially on a slow
	machine, or from a slow network connection, most likely more than
	a minute.  If some action doesn't eventually happen, or the
	spinning cursor has stopped and nothing further has happened,
	either your diskless setup is incorrect, or you may have a
	hardware or configuration problem.

@Jumbo commit for 4.7 installation instructions:
- do not mention tape as an installation media on systems where it is very
  unlikely that a tape drive can be connected to (i.e. anything with only
  USB as expansion capabilities)
- do not mention that fetching the installation sets from a partition is
  ``for upgrades only''. You may do this for installation, but of course
  you can not use a partition which will be newfs'ed for that purpose.
- mention ext2fs partitions as possible installation sets source only on
  platforms where the installation media actually can mount an ext2fs
  filesystem.
- stress the fact that the sparc miniroot image is a GENERIC kernel with
  a little on-disk filesystem, and not a RAMDISK kernel with a little
  in-memory filesystem, and thus must not be overwritten during installation
  (i.e. be careful if you repartition the disk the miniroot has been put on).
- more conv=sync -> conv=osync for tape setup instructions.
- model-specific layout changes on armish, loongson and socppc instructions.
- fix various typos and grammar mistaeks.

@Better description of the installation steps:
- document questions in proper order: hostname before network configuration,
  DNS only if network is configured, sshd and ntpd, aperture only on
  machines which need it, serial console only on machines which need it.
  This is done by splitting the end of OpenBSDCommonURL in various
  macros, OpenBSDInstallWrapup, OpenBSDInstallAperture, OpenBSDInstallConsole
  and OpenBSDInstallWrapupPart2.
- use the above macros when appropriate, OpenBSDInstallWrapup* being
  mandatory on all arches.
- remove serial console configuration blurb on sparc and sparc64, it is
  handled by OpenBSDInstallConsole now.

@Your spring jumbo m4-fu. This time:
- mention comp contains an objective-C compiler too.
- rewrite InstallPrelude so that it will only output the ``know your drive
  geometry'' blurb if asked to, and for a specified disk type. Use it for
  non-IDE and non-SCSI disks only, otherwise the kernel is good enough to
  do the job without the users' help.
- similarily, adapt BootMsgs to make the second part of the geometry blurb
  optional, and to accept up to three disk types. Use this to report better
  disk names (i.e. no point saying an scsi disk would show up as sd0 on
  platforms which can't have scsi disks, or won't be able to boot from them).
- in InstallPart4, drop the part about block and fragment sizes in
  disklabel. The defaults are good, and you won't get to change them unless
  you switched to expert mode.
- the default answer to ``wanna get the ftp mirror list, unzel?'' is ``no'',
  so pressing enter to get it is not enough anymore (-:

Enable rpc.bootparamd in /etc/rc.conf by changing the value of
"bootparamd_flags". Also, make sure "portmap" is "YES"; you will need
portmap running.

Now run `rpc.bootparamd' and make sure that the directory is NFS exported to
the client.  See the manual pages on your server system if you need more

Should your VAX have supported SCSI, however, we provide a floppy image
that can be written onto a disk in another system, and when booted on
the VAX will present you with the standard install prompt. If this is
the case, you can skip ahead to the "ready to install OpenBSD" section.

This document will shortly provide examples on how to set up services
for an OpenBSD netboot server. But if more information is required,
the following resources may be helpful:

The OpenBSD manpages for rarpd(8), mopd(8), nfsd(8), mountd(8),
rpc.bootparamd(8), bootparams(5), and diskless(8). These pages are
available online at: <http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi>

Brian Chase <bdc@@world.std.com> has written a guide for booting a VAX
off of a network.  It was written for NetBSD/MACHINE, but the procedure is
virtually identical on OpenBSD, and the document covers the use of
several different platforms as servers.
 
The guide is available at:
<http://world.std.com/~bdc/projects/vaxen/VAX-netboot-HOWTO>
 
And finally, there is an OpenBSD/MACHINE mailing list at <vax@@openbsd.org>
whose readers would generally be pleased to help.

When you turn on your VAX, it will run a set of self-diagnostic ROM routines.
Depending on the model of VAX you have, it may take quite a while.  When 
it is done, you will see a >>> prompt (also called the chevron prompt) on the
console.  Typing "show dev" or "show ethernet" to get the VAX ethernet 
device's MAC address usually works; also try "TEST 50" on MicroVAXen 2000
and 3100.

rpc.bootparamd's configuration file is /etc/bootparams.  The format for this
file is described in the diskless(8) and bootparams(5) manpages.  Enable
rpc.bootparamd in /etc/rc.conf by changing the value of "bootparamd_flags". 
Also, make sure "portmap" is "YES"; you will need portmap running.  

nfsd and mountd configuration are described in their respective manual pages.
Make a separate directory for your VAX's /, make sure it is exported via NFS, 
and place "bsd.rd" there.

	After entering the terminal type you will be asked whether you
	wish to do an "(I)nstall" or an "(U)pgrade".  Enter 'I' for a
	fresh install or 'U' to upgrade an existing installation.
	
	You will be presented with a welcome message and asked if
	you really want to continue. Assuming you answered yes, the
	install program will then tell you which disks of that type
	it can install on, and ask you which it should use.  The name
	of the disk is typically "sd0". Reply with the name of your disk.

	Next you will have to edit or create a disklabel for the disk
	OpenBSD is being installed on.  The installation script will
	invoke the text editor allowing you to do this.  Note that
	partition 'c' inside this disk label should ALWAYS reflect the
	entire disk, including any non-OpenBSD portions.  The root file
	system should be in partition 'a', and swap is usually in partition
	'b'.  It is recommended that you create separate partitions for
	root and /usr, you may also want to specify /var and /home
	partitions.

	The swap partition (usually 'b') should have a type of "swap", all
	other native OpenBSD partitions should have a type of "4.2BSD".
	Block and fragment sizes are usually 8192 and 1024 bytes, but can
	also be 16384 and 2048 bytes.

	The install program will now label your disk and ask which file
	systems should be created on which partitions.  It will auto-
	matically select the 'a' partition to be the root file system.
	Next it will ask for which disk and partition you want a file
	system created on.  This will be the same as the disk name (e.g.
	"sd0") with the letter identifying the partition (e.g. "d")
	appended (e.g. "sd0d").  Then it will ask where this partition is
	to be mounted, e.g. /usr.  This process will be repeated until
	you type "done".

	At this point you will be asked to confirm that the file system
	information you have entered is correct, and given an opportunity
	to change the file system table.  Next it will create the new file
	systems as specified, OVERWRITING ANY EXISTING DATA.  This is the
	point of no return.

	After all your file systems have been created, the install program
	will give you an opportunity to configure the network.  The network
	configuration you enter (if any) can then be used to do the install
	from another system using NFS, HTTP or FTP, and will also be the
	configuration used by the system after the installation is complete.

	If you select to configure the network, the install program will
	ask you for a name of your system and the DNS domain name to use.
	Note that the host name should be without the domain part, and that
	the domain name should NOT {:-include-:} the host name part.

	Next the system will give you a list of network interfaces you can
	configure.  For each network interface you select to configure, it
	will ask for the IP address to use, the symbolic host name to use,
	the netmask to use and any media flags to set.

	After all network interfaces have been configured the install pro-
	gram will ask for a default route and IP address of the primary
	name server to use.  You will also be presented with an opportunity
	to edit the host table.

	At this point you will be allowed to edit the file system table
	that will be used for the remainder of the installation and that
	will be used by the finished system, following which the new file
	systems will be mounted to complete the installation.

	After these preparatory steps have been completed, you will be
	able to extract the distribution sets onto your system.  There
	are several install methods supported; FTP, HTTP, tape, CD-ROM, NFS
	or a local disk partition.  Note that installation from floppies
	is not currently supported.

is the ethernet address followed by the machine name or address.  Here is an

At the moment, the only way to install OpenBSD/vax OSREV is via diskless 
booting over an Ethernet network.  You will need both the "boot.mop" 
image and the "bsd.rd" kernel to boot.  You will also need a machine 
configured as a rarp, MOP, bootparam, and NFS server.

This document will give a few examples on how to set up each of these 
services on an OpenBSD machine; if this is not enough information, 
check out the OpenBSD manpages for rarpd(8), mopd(8), rpc.bootparamd(8), 
bootparams(5), nfsd(8), mountd(8), and diskless(8).  Also, Brian Chase
