@- update supported hardware list
- harmonize installation text with other arches (getting boring)
- don't tryp to scare people in the description of the port (rough edges?
  come on, come on, almost none)

OpenBSD/vax OSREV is a port to the VAX series of machines, formerly

This port is still fairly recent, and for this reason it is still quite
"rough", although many areas are greatly improved since the previous
release.

@Update VAX installation notes:
- sync supported hardware list with web page
- use m4.common macros whenever possible
- mention sets size (might need an update)
- mention serial console is compulsory, and might need some hardware setup
