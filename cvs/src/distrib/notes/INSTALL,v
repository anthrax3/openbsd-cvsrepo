INSTALLATION NOTES for OpenBSD/MACHINE OSREV


What is OpenBSD?
----------------

OpenBSD is a fully functional, multi-platform UN*X-like Operating
System based on Berkeley Networking Release 2 (Net/2) and 4.4BSD-Lite.
There are several operating systems in this family, but OpenBSD
differentiates itself by putting security and correctness first.  The
OpenBSD team strives to achieve what is called a 'secure by default'
status.  This means that an OpenBSD user should feel safe that their
newly installed machine will not be compromised.  This 'secure by
default' goal is achieved by taking a proactive stance on security.

Since security flaws are essentially mistakes in design or implement-
ation, the OpenBSD team puts as much importance on finding and fixing
existing design flaws and implementation bugs as it does writing new
code.  This means that an OpenBSD system will not only be more secure,
but it will be more stable.  The source code for all critical system
components has been checked for remote-access, local-access, denial-
of-service, data destruction, and information-gathering problems.

In addition to bug fixing, OpenBSD has integrated strong cryptography
into the base system.  A fully functional IPsec implementation is
provided as well as support for common protocols such as SSL and SSH.
Network filtering and monitoring tools such as packet filtering, NAT,
and bridging are also standard, as well as several routing services,
such as BGP and OSPF.  For high performance demands, support for
hardware cryptography has also been added to the base system.  Because
security is often seen as a tradeoff with usability, OpenBSD provides
as many security options as possible to allow the user to enjoy secure
computing without feeling burdened by it.

Because OpenBSD is from Canada, the export of Cryptography pieces
(such as OpenSSH and IPsec) to the world is not restricted.

(NOTE: OpenBSD can not be re-exported from the US once it has entered
the US.  Because of this, take care NOT to get the distribution from
a mirror server in the US if you are outside of Canada and the US.)

A comprehensive list of the improvements brought by the OSREV release
is available on the web at https://www.OpenBSD.org/OSrev.html.
dnl
dnl MACHINE/whatis
dnl A few descriptive words about the port to MACHINE (i.e. what kind
dnl of hardware it runs on, without too much details - MACHINE/hardware
dnl will take care of this).
dnl Needs to start with a blank line if non empty.
includeit(whatis)dnl


Sources of OpenBSD:
-------------------

Please refer to https://www.openbsd.org/ftp.html for all the ways you may
acquire OpenBSD.


OpenBSD OSREV Release Contents:
-----------------------------

The OpenBSD OSREV release is organized in the following way.  In the
.../OSREV directory, for each of the architectures having an OpenBSD OSREV
binary distribution, there is a sub-directory.

includeit(contents)


OpenBSD System Requirements and Supported Devices:
--------------------------------------------------

includeit(hardware)


Verifying the OpenBSD Installation Media:
-----------------------------------------

As of OpenBSD 5.5, installations are able to verify files for the next
release.  The OpenBSD OSREV release was signed with the
/etc/signify/openbsd-{:--:}OSrev-base.pub release key.

If you have an existing OpenBSD 5.5 or higher installation, you can run
signify(1) to verify the signature and checksum.  For example, run the following
to verify that the cd{:--:}OSrev.iso file was distributed by the OpenBSD team:
	signify -C -p /etc/signify/openbsd-{:--:}OSrev-base.pub -x SHA256.sig cd{:--:}OSrev.iso

If you are unable to run or compile signify(1), use sha256(1) with the SHA256
file to see if a file was corrupt during the transfer.


Getting the OpenBSD System onto Useful Media:
---------------------------------------------

includeit(xfer)


Preparing your System for OpenBSD Installation:
-----------------------------------------------

includeit(prep)


Installing the OpenBSD System:
------------------------------

includeit(install)


Upgrading a previously-installed OpenBSD System:
------------------------------------------------

includeit(upgrade)


Getting source code for your OpenBSD System:
--------------------------------------------

Now that your OpenBSD system is up and running, you probably want to get
access to source code so that you can recompile pieces of the system.

You can get the pieces over the internet using anonymous CVS, CVSync,
FTP or HTTP(s). For more information, see:

	https://www.OpenBSD.org/anoncvs.html
	https://www.OpenBSD.org/cvsync.html
	https://www.OpenBSD.org/ftp.html


Using online OpenBSD documentation:
-----------------------------------

Documentation is available if you first install the manual pages
distribution set.  Traditionally, the UN*X "man pages" (documentation)
are denoted by 'name(section)'.  Some examples of this are

	intro(1),
	man(1),
	apropos(1),
	passwd(1),
	passwd(5) and
	afterboot(8).

The section numbers group the topics into several categories, but three
are of primary interest: user commands are in section 1, file formats
are in section 5, and administrative information is in section 8.

The 'man' command is used to view the documentation on a topic, and is
started by entering 'man [section] topic'.  The brackets [] around the
section should not be entered, but rather indicate that the section is
optional.  If you don't ask for a particular section, the topic with the
least-numbered section name will be displayed.  For instance, after
logging in, enter

	man passwd

to read the documentation for passwd(1).  To view the documentation for
passwd(5), enter

	man 5 passwd

instead.

If you are unsure of what man page you are looking for, enter

	apropos subject-word

where "subject-word" is your topic of interest; a list of possibly
related man pages will be displayed.


Adding third party software; ``packages'' and ``ports'':
--------------------------------------------------------

includeit(packages)


Administrivia:
--------------

There are various mailing lists available via the mailing list
server at <majordomo@@OpenBSD.org>.  To get help on using the mailing
list server, send mail to that address with an empty body, and it will
reply with instructions.

More information about the various OpenBSD mailing list and proper
netiquette is available at

	https://www.OpenBSD.org/mail.html

To report bugs, use the 'sendbug' command shipped with OpenBSD,
and fill in as much information about the problem as you can.  Good
bug reports {:-include-:} lots of details.  Additionally, bug reports can
be sent by mail to:

	bugs@@OpenBSD.org

dnl uncomment when this is true again...
dnl
dnl Use of 'sendbug' is encouraged, however, because bugs reported with it
dnl are entered into the OpenBSD bugs database, and thus can't slip through
dnl the cracks.
dnl
As a favor, please avoid mailing huge documents or files to the
mailing lists.  Instead, put the material you would have sent on
a web server, then mail the appropriate list about it, or if
you'd rather not do that, mail the list saying you'll send the data
to those who want it.

For more information about reporting bugs, see

To integrate more smoothly in other environments, OpenBSD OSREV also
provides, on some platforms, several binary emulation subsystems
(which includes iBCS2, Linux, OSF/1, SunOS, SVR4, Solaris, and Ultrix
compatibility), aiming at making the emulation as accurate as possible
so that it is transparent to the user.

Though security is the primary goal, OpenBSD continues the multi-
platform tradition.  Ports to mvme68k, powerpc and arc machines have
been added to the system.  To further this work, kernel interfaces
have continued to be refined and several subsystems and device drivers
are shared in a machine independent fashion among the different ports.
You can look for this trend to continue as newer architectures become
available.

To integrate more smoothly in other environments, OpenBSD OSREV has
significantly enhanced the binary emulation subsystem (which includes
iBCS2, Linux, OSF/1, SunOS, SVR4, Solaris, and Ultrix compatibility)
and several kernel subsystems have been generalized to support this
more readily.  The binary emulation strategy is aimed at making the
emulation as accurate as possible so that it is transparent to the
user.

Many new user programs have been added in OpenBSD OSREV, as well,

OpenBSD is a Berkeley Networking Release 2 (Net/2) and 4.4BSD-Lite
-derived Operating System.  It is a fully functional UN*X-like system
which runs on many architectures and is being ported to more.

Continuing the multi-platform tradition, OpenBSD has added ports to
mvme68k, powerpc and arc machines.  Kernel interfaces have continued
to be refined, and now several subsystems and device drivers are
shared among the different ports.  You can look for this trend to
continue.

Security of the system as a whole has been significantly improved.
Source code for all critical system components has been checked for
remote-access, local-access, denial-of-service, data destruction, or
information-gathering problems.  Tools like ssl, ssh, ipf, ipnat, and
nc have been added to the tree because security conscious people often
need them.

OpenBSD OSREV has significantly enhanced the binary emulation subsystem
(which includes iBCS2, Linux, OSF/1, SunOS, SVR4, Solaris and Ultrix
compatibility) and several kernel subsystems have been generalized to
support this more readily.  The binary emulation strategy is aimed at
making the emulation as accurate as possible.

Cryptography components are part of OpenBSD.  OpenBSD is from Canada,
and export of these pieces (such as kerberosIV) to the world is not
restricted.  Note that it can not be re-exported from the US once it
has entered the US.  Because of this, take care NOT to get the distrib-
ution from an FTP server in the US if you are outside of Canada and
the US.

The OpenBSD 2.1 release is organized in the following way:

.../2.1/
		src/			Source distribution sets; see
					below.

In addition to the files and directories listed above, there is one
directory per architecture, for each of the architectures that OpenBSD
2.1 has a binary distribution for.  (That is described further along in
this document).

The source distribution sets can be found in subdirectories of the
"source" subdirectory of the distribution tree.  They contain the 
complete sources to the system.  The source distribution sets 
are as follows:

	gsrc21	This set contains the "gnu" sources, including
		the source for the compiler, assembler, groff,
		and the other GNU utilities in the binary distribution
		sets.
		[ 7.1M gzipped, 30.4M uncompressed ]

	ksrc21	This set contains the sources to the OpenBSD 2.1
		kernel, config(8), config.old(8) and dbsym(8).
		[ 6.0M gzipped, 27.0M uncompressed ]

	ssrc21	This set contains the "share" sources, which include
		the sources for the man pages not associated with
		any particular program, the sources for the
		typesettable document set, the dictionaries, and more.
		[ 2.4M gzipped, 8.9M uncompressed ]

	src21	This set contains all of the OpenBSD 2.1 sources which
		are not mentioned above.
		[ 9.3M gzipped, 41.6M uncompressed ]

It is worth noting that unless all of the source distribution sets
are installed (except the domestic set), you can't rebuild and install
the system from scratch, straight out of the box.  However, all that is
required to rebuild the system in that case is a trivial modification 
to one Makefile.

The source distribution sets are distributed as groups of files named
"set_name.xx" where "set_name" is the distribution set name, and "xx"
is the sequence number of the file, starting with "aa" for the first
file in the distribution set, then "ab" for the next, and so on.  All
of these files except the last one of each set should be exactly
240,640 bytes long.  (The last file is just long enough to contain the
remainder of the data for that distribution set.)

Catted together, the files belonging to a source distribution set 
comprise a gzipped tar file.  If you want to look at list of the files
contained in the set, you could use the command:

	cd /usr/src; cat set_name.?? | tar tvfz -

or to actually extract the files contained in the set:

	cd /usr/src; cat set_name.?? | tar xfpz -

In each of the source distribution set directories, there are two
files named "CKSUMS" and "MD5" which contain the checksums of the
files in that directory, as generated by the cksum(1) and md5(1)
utilities respectively.  If you suspect that one of the files is
corrupt and have access to a cksum or md5 binary, you can compare
their output to the "CKSUMS" or "MD5" file.

striping.  The concatenated disk driver (ccd), which was previously
supported only by the hp300 port, has been vastly improved.  Many
bugs were fixed, and explicit references to device-dependent routines
removed and replaced by calls to the generic "vnode operation"
routines.  In addition, several features were added, including partition
support, dynamic configuration and unconfiguration via a user space system
utility program, and virtually unlimited number of component devices.

The Future of OpenBSD:
--- ------ -- ------

We hope to have regular releases of the full binary and source trees,
but these are difficult to coordinate, especially with all of the
architectures which we now support!  We hope to support even _more_
hardware in the future, and have a rather large number of other ideas
about what can be done to improve OpenBSD.  We intend to continue our
current practice of making the OpenBSD-current development source
available on a daily or nearly-daily basis.

We intend to integrate free, positive changes from whatever sources
will provide them, providing that they are well thought-out and
increase the usability of the system.

Above all, we hope to create a stable and accessible system, and to be
responsive to the needs and desires of OpenBSD users, because it is for
and because of them that OpenBSD exists.

The Future of NetBSD:
a52 25
The NetBSD Foundation was recently incorporated as a non-profit
organization.  It's purpose is to encourage, foster and promote the
free exchange of computer software, namely the NetBSD Operating
System.  The foundation will allow for many things to be handled more
smoothly than could be done with our previous informal organization.
In particular, it provides the framework to deal with other parties
that wish to become involved in the NetBSD Project. (IN WHAT WAY?  Money, donations, etc)

We believe that the NetBSD Foundation will help improve the quality 
of NetBSD by:

	* providing better organization to keep track of development
	  efforts, including co-ordination with groups working in 
	  related fields.

	* providing a framework to receive donations of goods and
          services and to own the resources necessary to run the
          NetBSD Project.

        * providing a better position from which to undertake
          promotional activities.

        * periodically organizing workshops for developers and other
          interested people to discuss ongoing work.

NetBSD 1.0 is a milestone release.  The hardest part of the 4.4BSD-Lite
integration, the kernel, has been completed and has been running in
"production use" for quite some time.  Also, NetBSD 1.0 is the first
true multi-architecture release of NetBSD.  At the time of NetBSD 0.9,
the i386 port was considered 'production quality' and the hp300 port was
barely working.  The NetBSD 1.0 source supports nine architectures, and
complete binary releases for most of them will be made available.

NetBSD 1.0 supports many new and improved features, the most important
relating to file systems.  New and improved versions of both the
Berkeley Fast File System and the free implementation of the NFS
protocol were provided, as part of the 4.4-Lite release.  The new
versions include such improvements as support for 64-bit file sizes,
for local files, and "lease" support for NFS, to improve performance.
In addition to the file system improvements, many other parts of the
system have been improved considerably.  For instance, the virtual
memory code has substantially improved performance, and many of the
kernel's interfaces have been cleaned up.
