@OpenBSD/MACHINE OSrev runs on the following classes of machines:
	- Decstation 2100 and 3100, also known as "pmin" and  "pmax" 
	- Personal Decstations (5000/20, and /25)  also known as "MAXINE"
	- Decstation 5000/120, /125, and /133, also known as "3MIN"
	- Decstation 5000/200, also known as "3MAX"
	- Decstation 5000/240, also known as "3MAXPLUS"

OpenBSD/MACHINE OSrev does *not* (yet) run on these machines:
	- Decstation 5100 (an r2000-based cousin of the Decstation 3100)
	- Decsystem 5400 and 5500 (Qbus-based systems, similar to a
	  Vax 'Mayfair' and 'Mayfair II', but with an r2000a or r3000
	  cpu instead of a CVAX cpu.) 
	- Decsystem 5800 (xbi-based multiprocessor, a Vax 8800 with
	  Vax CPU boards replaced with Mips cpu boards)

The minimal configuration requires 8M of RAM and ~60M of disk space.
To install the entire system requires much more disk space, and to run
X or compile the system, more RAM is recommended.  (OpenBSD with 8M of
RAM feels like Ultrix with 8M of RAM.) Note that until you have
around 16M of RAM, getting more RAM is more important than getting a
faster CPU.

Supported devices {:-include-:}:
	Decstation 2100 and 3100 baseboard video: 
		pm one-bit mono or 8-bit pseudocolor frame buffers.

	Decstation 5000 series TurboChannel video:
		PMAG-DV Personal Decstation baseboard 1024x768 frame buffer.
		PMAG-BA	1024x768 8-bit color frame buffer.
		PMAGB-BA  1024x768 8-bit color frame buffer.
		PMAG-AA  1280x1024 four-bit greyscale frame buffer.

		NOTE:  All supported DECstation video produces sync-on-green.
		Be sure to use either a DEC-compatible fixed-sync monitor
		or a multisync monitor that supports sync-on-green.

	serial ports: 
		ttya and ttyb (can be used as console if needed)

	ethernet: 
		on-board AMD Lance ethernet ("le0"), 
		TURBOchannel AMD Lance ethernet cards.

	SCSI: 
		on-board DEC "sii" SCSI controller (2100 and 3100)
		on-board "asc" SCSI controller (5000 series machines)
		TurboChannel "asc" SCSI controller, 

		NOTE:  If you want to connect a tape to the machine which
		you plan to use under OpenBSD/pmax make shure that the
		scsi id of the tape is either 5 or 6 because tape support
		is hardcoded to those ids in the kernel.

	DEC (LK-201 or compatible) keyboard 
	DEC ("hockey puck" or compatible) mouse.


Hardware that we do NOT currently support:
	Q-bus Decsystem machines
	Decstation 5100 machines
	PrestoServe NVRAM on Decstation 5100 machines 
	audio drivers for  Personal Decstation machines
	floppy driver for Personal Decstation machines
	TurboChannel audio hardware (LoFi)
	PMAG-C 2-D accelerated framebuffers with onboard i860 processors

	NOTE: the primary obstacle to support  of all but the very
	last item is non-availability of sample hardware for development.

	The primary obstacle for the i860-based framebuffers is that there
	is no documentation on the accelerator board.
