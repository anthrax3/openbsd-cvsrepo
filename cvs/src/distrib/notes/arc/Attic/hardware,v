@OpenBSD/arc OSREV runs on the following classes of machines:
	- Acer PICA61 (RISC-PC) Systems.
	- Deskstation rPC44.
	- Deskstation Tyne.

OpenBSD/pmax OSREV does *not* (yet) run on these machines:
	- Mips Magnum
	- Olivetti systems.
	- SNI RMxxx machines.
	- NEC Risc.

The minimal configuration requires 8M of RAM and ~60M of disk space.
To install the entire system requires ~150M of disk space, and to run
X or compile the system, 32Mb of RAM and ~1G of disk is recommended.

Supported devices {:-include-:}:
	graphics:
		built-in S3 VGA graphics adapter on PICA.
		Standard VGA graphics adapter on rPC44 and Tyne.
		Note that X11R6 currently supports only S3 boards.

	keyboard:
		Standard PC compatible keyboard with optionally
		driver softloaded keymaps.

	mouse:
		PS2 mouse on PICA
		Serial mouse on /dev/tty00 on rPC44 and Tyne.

	serial ports: 
		on-board tty00 and tty01 (PICA. can not yet be used as console)
		ISA tty00 and tty01 on systems without serial ports on
		the motherboard (Tyne).
		ISA tty02 and tty03 on all ISA capable systems.

	parallel ports:
		parallel ports is supported on-board (PICA) or on ISA
		(rPC44 and Tyne).

	floppy:
		floppy is supported on PICA only.

	ethernet: 
		on-board SONIC ethernet controller (PICA only)
		3Com Etherlink boards (All ISA capable systems)
		NE2000 compatible ISA boards.

	SCSI: 
		on-board NCR53C96 SCSI controller (PICA)
		VLB "Buslogic BT-440C/445C" SCSI controller.

	IDE:
		IDE disks via wd driver on ISA bus. Bootable only
		on Deskstation systems.

@First cut of the arc notes. I need people to look at them and add/change
things as it apply to their machines... It's far from finished - more or
