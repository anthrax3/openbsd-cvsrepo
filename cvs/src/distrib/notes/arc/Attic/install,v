@OpenBSDInstallPrelude

There are several ways to install OpenBSD onto a disk. The easiest way
in terms of preliminary setup is to use the OpenBSD ramdisk kernel that
can be booted off your local MSDOS disk or from the CD-ROM.


Installing using the OpenBSD ramdisk kernel.

The ramdisk kernel is a self-contained OpenBSD filesystem including all
utilities necessary to install OpenBSD on a local disk, embedded in a
GENERIC kernel image. It is distributed as a plain ECOFF executable file
designed to be loaded into the system by the ARC firmware.

Loading the ramdisk kernel into your system is done with the appropriate
BIOS Run command on Your system. Usually this is done by typing in the
following string at the "Run a program" prompt:

	scsi()disk()rdisk()partition(1)\bsd.rd

to boot from an existing MSDOS FAT partition to which the ramdisk kernel
have been copied. Or from the CD-ROM:

	CD:\OSREV\arc\bsd.rd

Exact input to describe the device path varies. Consult your ARC-Bios manual
for more information about the particular system.

This will cause the ramdisk kernel to be booted. After the initial probe
messages you'll asked to choose a shell with sh as default. Simply type
[Return] here and you are in single user mode.


Start the installation script:

	# install


The script will do most of the work of transferring the system from the
tar files onto your disk. You will frequently be asked for confirmation
before the script proceeds with each phase of the installation process.
Occasionally, you'll have to provide a piece of information such as the
name of the disk you want to install on or IP addresses and domain names
you want to assign.

The installation script goes through the following phases:

	- determination of the disk to install OpenBSD on
	- checking of the MBR partition information on the disk
	- checking of the OpenBSD partition information on the disk
	- creating and mounting the OpenBSD filesystems
	- setup of IP configuration
	- extraction of the distribution tar files
	- installation of kernel and the bootable kernel

The installation program will guide you through the installation. There is
one area of complexity that you should be very careful about and that is
how to install the required MBR (Msdos Boot Record) and MSDOS FAT partition.

OpenBSD will coexist with other operating systems with help from the MSDOS
partition table. Because the ARC Bios only knows how to boot from a FAT
formatted disk there must always exist a small or big (depending on your
needs) MSDOS FAT partition on the disk. Install will initialize the install
target disk with a proper MBR and an empty 5Mb MSDOS partition it that is
desired. Or it will keep the current MBR and partitioning. In the later case
you will need to fill in the MBR with a usable OpenBSD partition.


Now try a reboot (enter the command "reboot" at the prompt). This will take
you back to the ARC Bios. You will now need to set up a boot selection to
boot OpenBSD. How to do this varies from system to system and should be
described in your systems manual. The process to set up the parameters is
almost exactly the same as for Win/NT apart from the name of the OSLOADER
which should be set to 'bsd'. You may also set the OSLOADOPTIONS parameter
to any of the following characters:

	n = Ask for root device Name.	N = Don't as for root device Name.
	a = Autoboot to Multiuser mode.	A = Boot to single user mode.

So to boot the system to multiuser mode set:

	OSLOADOPTIONS=Na

Congratulations, you have successfully installed OpenBSD 2.3.  When you
reboot into OpenBSD, you should log in as "root" at the login prompt.
There is no initial password, but if you're using the machine in a
networked environment, you should create yourself an account and
protect it and the "root" account with good passwords.

Some of the files in the OpenBSD 2.3 distribution might need to be
tailored for your site.  In particular, the /etc/sendmail.cf file will
almost definitely need to be adjusted, and other files in /etc will
probably need to be modified.  If you are unfamiliar with UN*X-like
system administration, it's recommended that you buy a book that
discusses it.

in terms of preliminary setup is to use the OpenBSD simpleroot that can
be booted off your local disk. Alternatively, if your Decstation is
hooked up in a network you can find a server and arrange for a
diskless setup which is a convenient way to install on a machine whose
disk does not currently hold a usable operating system (see the
section `Installing using a diskless setup' below).

Installing using the OpenBSD simpleroot.

The miniroot is a self-contained OpenBSD filesystem holding a complete
OpenBSD/pmax rootfilesystem plus all utilities necessary to install
OpenBSD on a local disk. It is distributed as a plain file designed to
be transferred to a raw disk partition from which it can be booted
using the appropriate PROM command.
d16 3
a18 2
Loading the simpleroot onto your raw partition is simple. On OpenBSD
as well as SunOS you use a command like:
d20 1
a20 1
	# dd if=simpleroot21.fs of=/dev/rsd0c bs=20b conv=sync
d22 2
a23 2
Especially on OpenBSD/pmax you'll have to use /dev/rrz0c or something
like that instead of /dev/rsd0c.
d25 1
a25 1
Keep in mind that this will overwrite the contents of that disk!
d27 2
a28 1
After transferring the simpleroot to disk, bring the system down by:
d30 3
a32 1
	# halt
a33 1
Then boot the miniroot by typing the appropriate command at the PROM:
d35 1
a35 1
	>> boot rz(0,0,0)/bsd		# for Decstation 2100/3100
d37 1
a37 1
or
a38 1
	>> boot 5/rz0a/bsd		# for Decstation 5000's
d40 1
a40 123
If you've loaded the simpleroot onto some other disk than `rz0' adapt
the boot specifier accordingly.

This will cause the kernel contained in the simpleroot to be booted.
After the initial probe messages you'll asked to choose a shell with
sh as default. Simply type Return here and you are in single user
mode.

Installing using a diskless setup.

First, you must setup a diskless client configuration on a server. If
you are using a OpenBSD system as the boot-server, have a look at the
diskless(8) manual page for guidelines on how to proceed with this.
If the server runs another operating system, you'll have to consult
documentation that came with it (on SunOS systems, add_client(8) is a
good start).

XXX more to come here

As noted above in the section `Preparing your System for OpenBSD Installation',
you have several options when choosing a location to store the installation
filesets. However, the easiest way is to put the *.tar.gz files you want
to install into the root directory for your client on the server.

Next, unpack `base.tar.gz' and `etc.tar.gz' on the server in the root 
directory for your machine. If you elect to use a separately NFS-mounted
filesystem for `/usr' with your diskless setup, make sure the "./usr" base
files in base.tar.gz end up in the correct location. One way to do this is
to temporarily use a loopback mount on the server, re-routing <root>/usr to
your server's exported OpenBSD "/usr" directory. Also put the kernel and the
install/upgrade scripts into the root directory.

A few configuration files need to be edited:

	<root>/etc/hosts
		Add the IP addresses of both server and client.

	<root>/etc/myname
		This files contains the client's hostname; use the same
		name as in <root>/etc/hosts.

	<root>/etc/fstab
		Enter the entries for the remotely mounted filesystems.
		For example:
			server:/export/root/client       /     nfs  rw 0 0
			server:/export/exec/sun4.OpenBSD /usr  nfs  rw 0 0

Now you must populate the the `/dev' directory for your client. If you server
runs SunOS 4.x, you can simply change your working directory to `<root>/dev'
and run the MAKEDEV script: `sh MAKEDEV all'.

On SunOS 5.x systems, MAKEDEV can also be used, but there'll be error
messages about unknown user and groups. These errors are inconsequential
for the purpose of installing OpenBSD. However, you may want to correct them
if you plan to the diskless setup regularly. In that case, you may re-run
MAKEDEV on your OpenBSD machine once it has booted.

XXX more to come here

This will boot the OpenBSD kernel in single-user mode.

If you use a diskless setup with a separately NFS-mounted /usr filesystem,
mount /usr by hand now:

OpenBSD# mount /usr

XXX more to come here

Here follows an example of what you'll see while in the dislabel editor.
Do not touch any of the parameters except for the `label: ' entry and
the actual partition size information at the bottom (the lines starting
with `a:', `b:', ...).

The size and offset fields are given in sector units. Partitions on
which you intend to have a mountable filesystem, should be given
fstype `4.2BSD'. Remember, the `c' partition should describe the whole
disk. The `(Cyl. x - y)' info that appears after the hash (`#')
character is treated as a comment and need not be filled in when
altering partitions.

Special note: the line containing `8 partitions:' is best left alone,
even if you define less then eight partitions. If this line displays
a different number and the program complains about it (after you leave
the editor), then try setting it to `8 partitions:'.

<END SAMPLE DISKLABEL SCREEN>


else, start the installation script:

OpenBSD# sh install.sh


These scripts will do most of the work of transferring the system from the

to look at the output of the dmesg(8) command to see how your disks
have been identified by the kernel.

Now try a reboot.  (If needed, swap your scsi id's first).  Initially
I'd suggest you "boot" (Decstation 2100/3100) or "boot/rz0a/bsd", then
try multiuser after that. if you boot single-user the OpenBSD
incantation to make the root filesystem writable is
