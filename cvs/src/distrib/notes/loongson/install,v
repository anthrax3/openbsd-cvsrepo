OpenBSDInstallPrelude

Booting the installation media:

The easiest way to boot into the OpenBSD installer is to copy the miniroot
image to a USB stick using dd(1) and boot bsd.rd from the PMON prompt:

    PMON> boot -k /dev/fs/ext2@@usb0/bsd.rd

on Lemote systems, and

    PMON> load /dev/fs/ext2@@usb0/bsd.rd
    PMON> g

on Gdium systems.

Another way to boot into the OpenBSD installer is to copy the bsd.rd
installation kernel to the main Linux partition, and boot from it.

Assuming the installation kernel has been copied to /boot/bsd.rd on the
Linux system, at the PMON prompt, enter

    PMON> boot -k /dev/fs/ext2@@wd0/boot/bsd.rd

on Lemote systems, and

    PMON> load /dev/fs/ext2@@usbg0/boot/bsd.rd
    PMON> g

on Gdium systems.
dnl
dnl Alternatively, if your particular PMON flavour supports `fat' filesystems,
dnl you can boot the kernel from an usb key with:
dnl 
dnl    PMON> boot /dev/fs/fat@@usb0:/bsd.rd

Netbooting the installation kernel can be done as well:

    PMON> ifaddr rtl0 <your ip>
    PMON> boot -k tftp://<server ip>/bsd.rd

	The fdisk(8) utility will be invoked to let you edit your MBR
	partitioning.  The current MBR partitions defined will be
	displayed and you will be allowed to modify them, and add new
	partitions.

	The setup will need one 'Linux files' partition and an 'OpenBSD'
	partition. If you use the whole disk option, the install script
	will create a small 'Linux files' partition and use the rest of
	the disk for the OpenBSD installation.

	After your OpenBSD MBR partition has been setup, the real
	partition setup can follow.

	Linux partitions defined on the disk will usually show up as
	partition 'i', 'j' and so on.-:})

OpenBSDInstallWrapup

Lemote systems final steps:

	Lemote systems ship with a boot menu.  After an installation
	preserving the Linux partitions is complete, you can add an OpenBSD
	entry to the boot menu to be able to boot OpenBSD more easily.

	The boot menu contents are found in /boot/boot.cfg on the Linux
	partition. To add an OpenBSD entry, simply add a new entry in the
	file, such as:

		title OpenBSD
			kernel /dev/fs/ext2@@wd0/boot/boot
			args ""

	In the example above, /dev/fs/ext2@@wd0/boot/boot is the PMON path
	to the OpenBSD bootloader, which is copied to that location by the
	install script.

	You may make OpenBSD the default option by changing the ``default''
	line near the top of the file. The value on this line is the index
	of the default entry, starting at zero. So if you added the OpenBSD
	entry as the fourth entry in the file, it would become the default
	choice with:

		default 3

	The timeout until the default choice is selected, in seconds, can
	be modified on the ``timeout'' line.

	However, due to side effects of PMON operation, automatic loading
	of OpenBSD binaries (bootloader or kernel) causes a register dump
	to be silently displayed by PMON; while it won't be visible on
	screen, PMON will gladly wait for user input to continue if it
	believes it has written too much output.

	To overcome this annoyance, simply change the `moresz' environment
	variable to a large value (30 or larger will do):

	    PMON> set moresz 30

	The bootloader will attempt to load the kernel file set in the `bsd'
	environment variable. Should this fail, it will wait for user
	commands. The value of `bsd' should be a path within the OpenBSD
	root filesystem on the disk, such as:

	    PMON> set bsd /bsd

	If you have removed the Linux installation or if you do not want to
	use the boot menu, you may simply disable it in the environment, and
	set the `al' variable to point to the bootloader path:

	    PMON> set ShowBootMenu no
	    PMON> set al /dev/fs/ext2@@wd0/boot/boot

	Alternatively, you might want to create a /boot/boot.cfg file in the
	small Linux partition created by the installation.

	On the Fuloong 2F, getting PMON to use the serial console is tricky,
	due to PMON bugs and design decisions made by Lemote. PMON's default
	serial speed is 115200, and OpenBSD will also use that speed. By
	default, it is only possible to use serial input if no USB keyboard is
	attached. PMON will nevertheless display its output on the VGA display.
	To get full serial access, the first step is to boot into PMON> with
	both serial console and VGA display but no USB keyboard attached.
	You can type on the serial console, but output will be shown on the
	VGA display. Next enter the following commands:

	    PMON> set novga 1
	    PMON> set nokbd 1
	    PMON> set al ""
	    PMON> set ShowBootMenu no

	If you have a dual boot setup, mount the Linux boot partition and
	rename /boot/boot.cfg so that it does not get found by PMON. This
	will enable full serial access to PMON on the Fuloong 2F.

Gdium systems final steps:

	Gdium systems do not have a boot menu, and directly boot the system
	(Linux, by default). Unfortunately, the OpenBSD bootloader operation
	is very limited on this machine, as it can not access USB devices
	(which means no keyboard input as well).

	To overcome this and be able to boot OpenBSD nevertheless, the
	bootloader relies upon PMON's ability to load a Linux so-called
	``initrd'' image. By making PMON load the kernel as the ``initrd''i
	image, and then run the bootloader, the bootloader will be able to
	``load'' the OpenBSD kernel correctly.

	The path to the file booted by default is set in the `al' environment
	variable, and the path to the initrd image is set in the `rd'
	environment variable.

	To boot the bsd kernel on the G-Key by default, assuming it has been
	copied to /boot/bsd on the first ext3 partition, and the bootloader
	has been copied to /boot/boot on the same filesystem, the settings
	are:

	    PMON> set al /dev/fs/ext2@@usbg0/boot/boot
	    PMON> set rd /dev/fs/ext2@@usbg0/boot/bsd

	Alternatively, you can disable autoboot by removing this variable:

	    PMON> unset al

@Jumbo commit for 4.7 installation instructions:
- do not mention tape as an installation media on systems where it is very
  unlikely that a tape drive can be connected to (i.e. anything with only
  USB as expansion capabilities)
- do not mention that fetching the installation sets from a partition is
  ``for upgrades only''. You may do this for installation, but of course
  you can not use a partition which will be newfs'ed for that purpose.
- mention ext2fs partitions as possible installation sets source only on
  platforms where the installation media actually can mount an ext2fs
  filesystem.
- stress the fact that the sparc miniroot image is a GENERIC kernel with
  a little on-disk filesystem, and not a RAMDISK kernel with a little
  in-memory filesystem, and thus must not be overwritten during installation
  (i.e. be careful if you repartition the disk the miniroot has been put on).
- more conv=sync -> conv=osync for tape setup instructions.
- model-specific layout changes on armish, loongson and socppc instructions.
- fix various typos and grammar mistaeks.
