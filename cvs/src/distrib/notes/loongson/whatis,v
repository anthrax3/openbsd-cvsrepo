log
@Add support for the Lemote Lynloong all-in-one PC (basically a Fuloong without
the serial and IR ports, built into a mac-like case). At least PMON initializes
the frame buffer in a much friendlier video mode (1360x768x16), but there is
still no frame buffer acceleration yet.

Tested by wvdputte.
