@Delete horrifically out of data add-on-peripheral lists; there are other
places to check for this information, or trial and error, with error
resulting in things getting fixed.  Scary false warnings don't help anyone.
Unmaintainable lists are always unmaintained.

The following machines are supported by OpenBSD/MACHINE:

	Lemote Fuloong 2F
	  onboard serial port, audio, USB and Ethernet are supported;
	  onboard display is only supported in the video mode setup by
	  the firmware (usually 640x400x8), without acceleration.

	Lemote Lynloong
	  onboard audio, USB and Ethernet are supported;
	  onboard display is only supported in the 1360x768x16 video mode
	  set up by the firmware, without acceleration.

	Lemote Yeeloong (8.9" and 10.1" models)
	  all onboard devices (keyboard, trackpad, display, SD card reader,
	  USB ports, Ethernet adapter, wireless network adapter, audio,
	  webcam on the 8.9" model, battery and power information) are
	  supported; suspend/resume is also supported.

	Gdium Liberty 1000
	  all onboard devices (keyboard, trackpad, display, SD card reader,
	  USB ports, Ethernet adapter, wireless network adapter,
	  battery information) are supported except for the audio controller;
	  suspend/resume is not supported yet; keyboard actions involving
	  the `Fn' key are not working either at the moment.

@Add support for the Lemote Lynloong all-in-one PC (basically a Fuloong without
the serial and IR ports, built into a mac-like case). At least PMON initializes
the frame buffer in a much friendlier video mode (1360x768x16), but there is
still no frame buffer acceleration yet.

Tested by wvdputte.
