@r1.45 of macppc install.md eliminated the verbiage exhorting users
to create an HFS partition with type AND name 'OpenBSD'. Worse, it
added checks to make sure the partition type and name were correct.

Sevan Janiyan pointed out that the example in INSTALL.macppc did
not show the 'n' command required to set the name of the OpenBSD
partition to 'OpenBSD'. Thus leaving HFS users possibly puzzled
over partitioning prerequisites.

Add required command to example.

OpenBSDInstallPrelude

Before you begin, you should decide if OpenBSD is to be installed
on the whole disk or share the disk with Mac OS.

For stand-alone (No Mac OS installed) or dedicated disks, the MBR
installation method should be chosen and no additional prep is necessary.

If the disk is to be shared with Mac OS, a partition must be preallocated
by the Mac OS partition editor and Mac OS installed to the proper partition.
This expects that the HFS partition will be the first partition on
the disk, and then the OpenBSD partition will follow.
This may require the disk be reformatted using the "Drive Setup" application
and reinstalled under Mac OS.

OpenBSDInstallPart2

	At this time, the system can be installed from the supplied
	CD-ROM boot image, by network loading the bootloader, or loading
	the bootloader and kernel from an HFS partition.

	Once the bootloader is installed on the local hard drive, the
	system can boot from it. OpenBSD may share a drive with Mac OS
	if the process is followed carefully. Currently it is
	necessary to use Open Firmware commands to dual boot between
	OS's, or multiple drives may be used with each OS owning drive(s).
	It is also possible on some newer models to set up the system
	to auto boot OpenBSD and if Mac OS is desired, choose it using
	the firmware boot selector by holding down the <option> key
	during reboot and selecting the Mac OS Disk icon.

	(Refer to "Preparing your System for OpenBSD Installation" above
	 for information on how to access and boot from Open Firmware.)

OpenBSDInstallPart3(,"wd0")

OpenBSDInstallPart4

	Disks on OpenBSD/MACHINE are partitioned either using Apple-style
	HFS partitions, or MBR partitions.

	OpenBSD/MACHINE can share a disk with Mac OS or Mac OS X by using
	an HFS partitioned disk. For proper layout, the disk should be
	partitioned with Mac OS or Mac OS X first with unused space or a
	spare partition where OpenBSD can be installed.

	The installation program will ask you whether you intend to use
	HFS or MBR partitions.

	HFS partitioning:

		HFS partition tables are edited with pdisk(8).  The most
		common operation, and the example presented here, deals
		with the conversion of an existing partition into one usable
		by OpenBSD.

		Before editing, the partition table may look like the
		following:

	 #:                type name             length   base    ( size )

		Otherwise, fdisk(8) will be invoked to let you to edit

	Mac OS or Mac OS X.
	If the disk is partitioned using MBR, the bootloader will be

	partition as position `i' in the label.

@Jumbo commit for 4.7 installation instructions:
- do not mention tape as an installation media on systems where it is very
  unlikely that a tape drive can be connected to (i.e. anything with only
  USB as expansion capabilities)
- do not mention that fetching the installation sets from a partition is
  ``for upgrades only''. You may do this for installation, but of course
  you can not use a partition which will be newfs'ed for that purpose.
- mention ext2fs partitions as possible installation sets source only on
  platforms where the installation media actually can mount an ext2fs
  filesystem.
- stress the fact that the sparc miniroot image is a GENERIC kernel with
  a little on-disk filesystem, and not a RAMDISK kernel with a little
  in-memory filesystem, and thus must not be overwritten during installation
  (i.e. be careful if you repartition the disk the miniroot has been put on).
- more conv=sync -> conv=osync for tape setup instructions.
- model-specific layout changes on armish, loongson and socppc instructions.
- fix various typos and grammar mistaeks.

@Your spring jumbo m4-fu. This time:
- mention comp contains an objective-C compiler too.
- rewrite InstallPrelude so that it will only output the ``know your drive
  geometry'' blurb if asked to, and for a specified disk type. Use it for
  non-IDE and non-SCSI disks only, otherwise the kernel is good enough to
  do the job without the users' help.
- similarily, adapt BootMsgs to make the second part of the geometry blurb
  optional, and to accept up to three disk types. Use this to report better
  disk names (i.e. no point saying an scsi disk would show up as sd0 on
  platforms which can't have scsi disks, or won't be able to boot from them).
- in InstallPart4, drop the part about block and fragment sizes in
  disklabel. The defaults are good, and you won't get to change them unless
  you switched to expert mode.
- the default answer to ``wanna get the ftp mirror list, unzel?'' is ``no'',
  so pressing enter to get it is not enough anymore (-:

@Since the installation procedure will list all the supported media flags
via ifconfig -m, there is no need to suggest canonical media flags on
some arches, especially since the end user might have a different
interface with different flags; instead, be more cosy and mention that
looking at the manual page for the interface might be helpful for
desperate cases.

Thus, merge the OpenBSDInstallNet and OpenBSDInstallNet2 macros, and
remove thde in-between text for the arches that had such a paragraph.

	Now you will be asked whether you wish to do an "install"
	or an "upgrade".  Enter 'i' for a fresh install or 'u' to
	upgrade an existing installation.

	You will be presented with a welcome message and asked if
	you really wish to install (or upgrade).  Assuming you
	answered yes, you will be asked which terminal type to use.
	You should just hit return to select the default (vt220).

	The install program will then tell you which disks of that
	type it can install on, and ask you which it should use.  The
	name of the disk is typically "wd0" for IDE/ATA drives or
	"sd0" for SCSI drives.  Reply with the name of your disk.
d109 8
a116 13
	Next the disk label which defines the layout of the OpenBSD file
	systems must be set up.  The installation script will invoke an
	editor allowing you to do this.  Note that partition 'c' inside
	this disk label should ALWAYS reflect the entire disk, including
	any non-OpenBSD portions.  The root file system should be in
	partition 'a', and swap is usually in partition 'b'.  If you have
	DOS or Linux partitions defined on the disk, these will usually
	show up as partition 'h', 'i' and so on.  It is recommended that
	you create separate partitions for /usr and /var, and if you have
	room for it, also for /home.  Currently OpenBSD will not share a
	disk with any other operating system care should be taken not to
	overwrite any data on other disks in the system and that no data
	is on the disk to be used for OpenBSD/MACHINE.

	is within the bounds of the 'c' partition.
d123 5
a127 55
	The swap partition (usually 'b') should have a type of "swap", all
	other native OpenBSD partitions should have a type of "4.2BSD".
	Block and fragment sizes are usually 8192 and 1024 bytes, but can
	also be 4096 and 512 or even 16384 and 2048 bytes.

	The install program will now label your disk and ask which file
	systems should be created on which partitions.  It will auto-
	matically select the 'a' partition to be the root file system.
	Next it will ask for which disk and partition you want a file
	system created on.  This will be the same as the disk name (e.g.
	"sd0") with the letter identifying the partition (e.g. "d")
	appended (e.g. "sd0d").  Then it will ask where this partition is
	to be mounted, e.g. /usr.  This process will be repeated until
	you just hit return.

	At this point you will be asked to confirm that the file system
	information you have entered is correct, and given an opportunity
	to change the file system table.  Next it will create the new file
	systems as specified, OVERWRITING ANY EXISTING DATA.  This is the
	point of no return.

	After all your file systems have been created, the install program
	will give you an opportunity to configure the network.  The network
	configuration you enter (if any) can then be used to do the install
	from another system using HTTP or FTP, and will also be the
	configuration used by the system after the installation is complete.

	If you select to configure the network, the install program will
	ask you for a name of your system and the DNS domain name to use.
	Note that the host name should be without the domain part, and that
	the domain name should NOT {:-include-:} the host name part.

	Next the system will give you a list of network interfaces you can
	configure.  For each network interface you select to configure, it
	will ask for the IP address to use, the symbolic host name to use,
	the netmask to use and any interface-specific flags to set.  The
	interface-specific flags are usually used to determine which media
	the network card is to use. Supply the appropriate media options
	as suggested, Typically no media flags are required as autodetect
	normally works.

	After all network interfaces has been configured the install pro-
	gram will ask for a default route and IP address of the primary
	name server to use.  You will also be presented with an opportunity
	to edit the host table.

	At this point you will be allowed to edit the file system table
	that will be used for the remainder of the installation and that
	will be used by the finished system, following which the new file
	systems will be mounted to complete the installation.

	After these preparatory steps have been completed, you will be
	able to extract the distribution sets onto your system.  There
	are several install methods supported; FTP, HTTP, tape, CD-ROM
	or a local disk partition.

You should now be ready to install OpenBSD.

The following is a walk-through of the steps you will take while
getting OpenBSD installed on your hard disk.  If any question has a
default answer, it will be displayed in brackets ("[]") after the
question.  If you wish to stop the installation, you may hit Control-C
at any time, but if you do, you'll have to begin the installation
process again from scratch.
d35 1
a35 10
	You will then be presented with the OpenBSD kernel boot
	messages.  You will want to read them, to determine your
	disk's name and geometry.  Its name will be something like
	"wd0" or "sd0" and the geometry will be printed on a line that
	begins with its name.  As mentioned above, you will need your
	disk's geometry when creating OpenBSD's partitions.  You will
	also need to know the name, to tell the install tools what
	disk to install on.  If you cannot read the messages as they
	scroll by, do not worry -- you can get at this information
	later inside the install program.
d37 2
a38 5
	While booting, you will probably see several warnings.  You
	should be warned that no swap space is present, and that
	init(8) cannot find /etc/rc.  Do not be alarmed, these are
	completely normal.  When you reach the prompt asking you for a
	shell name, just hit return.
