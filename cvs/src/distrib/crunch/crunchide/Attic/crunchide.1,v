.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm crunchide
.Nd hides symbol names from ld, for crunching programs together
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm crunchide
.Op Fl f Ar keep-list-file
.Op Fl k Ar keep-symbol
.Ar object-file ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
hides the global symbols of
.Ar object-file
such that they are ignored by subsequent runs of the linker,
.Xr ld 1 .
Some symbols may be left visible via the
.Fl k Ar keep-symbol
and
.Fl f Ar keep-list-file
options.
The
.Ar keep-list-file
must contain a list of symbols to keep visible, one symbol per line.
Note that the C compiler prepends an underscore in front of
symbols, so to keep the C function ``foo'' visible, the option
.Dq -k _foo
must be used.
.Pp
.Nm
is designed as a companion program for
.Xr crunchgen 1 ,
which automates the process of creating crunched binaries from
multiple component programs.
.Sh NOTES
The ELF version of
.Nm crunchide
mangles the symbol table beyond recognition.
It is therefore not advisable to try to run
.Xr nm 1
on a crunched object file.
This is due to the nature of the ELF symbol table
and how some arches uses the symbol attributes for their GOT build.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr crunchgen 1 ,
.Xr ld 1

@- remove all trailing whitespace
     * except when it is escaped with a `\' at the end of the line
- fix remaining .Nm usage as well
- this is from a patch I received from kwesterback@@home.com, who has been
  working on some scripts for fixing formatting errors in mdoc'd man pages

Ok, so there could be a cost/benefit debate with this commit, but since I have
the patch we might as well commit it...
