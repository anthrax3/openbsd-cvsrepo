@Remove ipf.  Darren Reed has interpreted his (old, new, whichever)
licence in a way that makes ipf not free according to the rules we
established over 5 years ago, at www.openbsd.org/goals.html (and those
same basic rules govern the other *BSD projects too).  Specifically,
Darren says that modified versions are not permitted.  But software
which OpenBSD uses and redistributes must be free to all (be they
people or companies), for any purpose they wish to use it, including
modification, use, peeing on, or even integration into baby mulching
machines or atomic bombs to be dropped on Australia.  Furthermore, we
know of a number of companies using ipf with modification like us, who
are now in the same situation, and we hope that some of them will work
with us to fill this gap that now exists in OpenBSD (temporarily, we
hope).

#  This is an example of a very light firewall used to guard against
#  some of the most easily exploited common security holes.
#
#  The example assumes it is running on a gateway with interface ppp0
#  attached to the outside world, and interface ed0 attached to
#  network 192.168.4.0 which needs to be protected.
#
#
#  Pass any packets not explicitly mentioned by subsequent rules
#
pass out from any to any
pass in from any to any
#
#  Block any inherently bad packets coming in from the outside world.
#  These include ICMP redirect packets and IP fragments so short the
#  filtering rules won't be able to examine the whole UDP/TCP header.
#
block in log quick on ppp0 proto icmp from any to any icmp-type redir
block in log quick on ppp0 proto tcp/udp all with short
#
#  Block any IP spoofing atempts.  (Packets "from" our network
#  shouldn't be coming in from outside).
