@documents which have not been modified in 15 years are not alive.  there
must have been mistruths in them or they are simply history and google is
better at finding either.

The documents in this directory consist of various, miscellaneous, system docs:

	html/		HTML documents for bind, curses, httpd, lynx, and milter
	psd/		UNIX Programmer's Supplementary Documents
	smm/		UNIX System Manager's Manuals
	usd/		UNIX User's Supplementary Documents

The documentation in the psd, smm, and usd subdirectories are roff source,
and can be used to generate documents in any of the formats available to the
groff(1) document formatting system.

Within any given subdirectory, simply typing:

	# make

will generate a pre-formatted document in PostScript format, called `paper.ps'.
The document can be viewed with the help of a PostScript viewer, such as
`ghostview' or `gv', and the PostScript back-end `ghostscript'. See ports(7)
and packages(7) for further information on how to install this software.

ASCII text format documents, suitable for viewing with a pager such as
less(1), can be generated by typing:

	# make paper.txt

However, the PostScript output is much prettier :)

The documentation in the html subdirectory can by viewed using any HTML-capable
browser such as lynx(1).

Note: Some of the subdirectories are empty, for a variety of reasons:
the papers are simply out of date; the papers refer to applications no
longer installed on the system; licensing issues; the papers have been
superseded by GNU info(1) files, etc.

@Move the Apache manual out of etcXX and to miscXX where it belongs.
It has also been moved to /usr/share/doc/html/httpd/.  This will
ease sysmerge upgrades and help keep htdocs clean.
