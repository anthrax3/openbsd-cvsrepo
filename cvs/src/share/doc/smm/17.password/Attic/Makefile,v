@add paper.txt target: now you can run `make paper.txt' to build an ASCII
version of the doc;

CAVEATS:
- some characters are not displayable as ascii and generate a warning
(until i get a chance to fix it)
- i haven't had a chance to put a nice left hand margin in the text versions
yet
- postscript output still looks much nicer

@The classic password paper by Thompson and Morris, with the Caldera license. It may be written
about 25 years ago, but it is still worth reading.
