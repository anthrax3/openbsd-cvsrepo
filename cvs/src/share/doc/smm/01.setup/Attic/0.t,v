This document contains instructions for the
installation and operation of the
\*(4B release of UNIX\**
as distributed by The University of California at Berkeley.
.FS
UNIX is a registered trademark of USL in the USA and some other countries.
.FE
.PP
It discusses procedures for installing UNIX on a new machine,
and for upgrading an existing \*(Ps UNIX system to the new release.
An explanation of how to lay out filesystems on available disks
and the space requirements for various parts of the system are given.
A brief overview of the major changes to
the system between \*(Ps and \*(4B are outlined.
An explanation of how to set up terminal lines and user accounts,
and how to do system-specific tailoring is provided.
A description of how to install and configure the \*(4B networking
facilities is included.
Finally, the document details system operation procedures:
shutdown and startup, filesystem backup procedures,
resource control, performance monitoring, and procedures for recompiling
and reinstalling system software.
