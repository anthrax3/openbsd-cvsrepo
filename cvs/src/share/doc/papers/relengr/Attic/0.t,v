This paper describes an approach used by a small group of people
to develop and integrate a large software system.
It details the development and release engineering strategy
used during the preparation of the \*(b3 version of the UNIX\(dg

operating system.
Each release cycle is divided into an initial development phase
followed by a release engineering phase.
The release engineering of the distribution is done in three steps.
The first step has an informal control policy for tracking modifications;
it results in an alpha distribution.
The second step has more rigid change mechanisms in place;
it results in a beta release.
During the final step changes are tracked very closely;
the result is the final distribution.
