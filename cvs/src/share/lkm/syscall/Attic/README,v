1.0	Overview

	This is the README file for the sample loaded system call.


2.0	Directions

	To test the module, do the following:

		cd module
		make load

	A load message (the copyright) will be printed on the console.

		cd ../test
		make load

	The system call prints a message on the console when called.
	This message will be printed when running "make load" in
	the "test" subdirectory.


3.0	Recovering resources

	The system call consumes 8 pages of memory when loaded; it
	can be freed up by unloading it.  To unload it, type the
	following from the directory this file is in:

		cd module
		make unload

	The system call will be unloaded by name.
