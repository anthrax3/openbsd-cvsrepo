 * XXX THE FOLLOWING COMMENT IS PROBABLY BOGUS...	- cgd, 12/24/94
 * Currently, the mount system call is broken in the way it operates
 * and the vfssw[] table does not have a character string identifier
 * for the file system type; therefore, to remount a file system after
 * it has been mounted in the first place, the offset into the table
 * must be the same; this will be corrected in future patches, but
 * not right now.  At the same time the fstab format will need to
 * change to allow definition without mount of file systems.
 *
 * The flags field is a parameter to the init; this could be used to
 * change the file system operation: for instance, in ISOFS, this
 * could be used to enable/disable Rockridge extensions.

 *
 * Since we expect to link in the kernel and add external symbols to
 * the kernel symbol name space in a future version, generally all
 * functions used in the implementation of a particular module should
 * be static unless they are expected to be seen in other modules or
 * to resolve unresolved symbols already existing in the kernel (the
 * second case is not likely to ever occur).
 *
 * The entry point should return 0 unless it is refusing load (in which
