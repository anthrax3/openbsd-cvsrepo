#
# Hierarchical queueing for a university.
# Three faculties; engineering, law and art are defined.
# Departments under the engineering faculty are defined as child queues.
# The total bandwidth for engineering faculty is shared between three
# departments. CS department gets the half of the bandwidth, EE and IE
# departments get the thirty percent and twenty percent of bandwidth
# respectively. These sibling departments can use more than their linkshare
# whenever there is no backlogged sibling queue but when a queue gets
# backlogged, it is guaranteed that the queue gets its linkshare.

altq on dc0 bandwidth 16Mb hfsc queue { eng law art }
queue eng bandwidth 10Mb { cs ee ie }
queue  cs hfsc( default linkshare 50% ) 
queue  ee hfsc( linkshare 30% ) 
queue  ie hfsc( linkshare 20% )
queue law bandwidth 3Mb
queue art bandwidth 3Mb
