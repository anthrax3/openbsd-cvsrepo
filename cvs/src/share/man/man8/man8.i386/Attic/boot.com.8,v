.Sh NAME
.Nm boot.com
.Nd Boot an OpenBSD kernel from MS-DOS
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm BOOT
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility, executed from an MS-DOS prompt, will load a kernel stored
in the DOS partition, effectively booting OpenBSD.  There are no
command line arguments.
.Pp
.Nm
functions identically to the standalone bootblocks, except that it
only loads files on a DOS partition.  After printing the `Boot:'
prompt, there is a timeout of several seconds.  If no key is pressed in
that time, the default kernel
.Em bsd
is loaded from the root directory of the DOS C: partition.
.Sh CAVEATS
The file
.Pa /usr/mdec/boot.com
and a valid kernel file must be copied to the root directory
of the DOS C: partition.
.Pp
If the desired FFS root filesystem is not on the first drive in the
system, the
.Fl r
flag (use the kernel's compiled-in default root device)
must be supplied when booting the kernel, i.e.:
.Pp
.Bd -literal -offset indent
Boot: [[[wd(0,a)]bsd][-abcdrs]] : bsd -r
.Ed
.Sh BUGS
.Nm
will not load kernels compressed with
.Xr gzip 1 ,
or ramdisk kernels larger than 3M in size.
.Pp
.Nm
always assumes the kernel is in the root directory of the DOS drive; to
load a kernel from the current directory, the name must be entered at
the `Boot:' prompt with no leading slashes.
.Pp
Loading a kernel from anywhere
other than the root directory or the current directory is not supported.
.Sh FILES
.Pa /usr/mdec/boot.com

log
@- remove all trailing whitespace
     * except when it is escaped with a `\' at the end of the line
- fix remaining .Nm usage as well
- this is from a patch I received from kwesterback@@home.com, who has been
  working on some scripts for fixing formatting errors in mdoc'd man pages

Ok, so there could be a cost/benefit debate with this commit, but since I have
the patch we might as well commit it...
