@Retire hp300, mvme68k and mvme88k ports. These ports have no users, keeping
this hardware alive is becoming increasingly difficult, and I should heed the
message sent by the three disks which have died on me over the last few days.

Noone sane will mourn these ports anyway. So long, and thanks for the fish.

.Dt BOOT_HP300 8 hp300
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm boot_hp300
.Nd hp300 system bootstrapping procedures
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Ss Cold starts
When powered on, the hp300
firmware will proceed to its initialization, and
will boot an operating system from the first bootable device found.
By pressing the
.Dq enter
key during the initialization sequence, the user can force another
device to be used.
.Ss Warm starts
After a panic, or if the system is rebooted via
.Xr reboot 8
or
.Xr shutdown 8 ,
the firmware will restart from the previous boot device.
.Ss Bootable devices
The following devices can be booted from the firmware:
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
Any disk successfully probed, and containing a boot program in a
.Tn LIF
format directory at its beginning.
.It
Any network interface, for which a
.Xr rbootd 8
server is listening on the network.
.El
.Ss Boot process options
The
.Ox
bootloader will let the user enter a boot device, kernel
filename and boot options.
.Pp
If the special line
.Ic reset
is entered, the bootloader will attempt to restart the machine.
.Pp
The file specification used for an interactive boot is of the form:
.Dl device unit partition : filename   options
where:
.Bl -tag -width device -compact
.It Ar device
is the type of the device to be searched.
Currently,
.Li ct Pq HP-IB tape ,
.Li hd Pq HP-IB disk ,
.Li le Pq network ,
and
.Li sd Pq SCSI disk or tape
are the only valid
.Ar device
specifiers.
.It Ar unit
is the device ID for
.Tn SCSI
devices, and the
.Li "(8 * the HP-IB controller number + the device unit number)"
formula for
.Tn HP-IB
devices.
Controller and unit numbering start at zero.
.It Ar minor
is the disk partition letter or tape file number.
.El
Normal line editing characters can be used when typing the file specification.
.Pp
For example,
to boot the
.Pa /bsd
kernel from the
.Dq a
file system of unit 0 on second HP-IB controller, type
.Dq rd8a:/bsd
at the boot prompt.
.Pp
The following options are recognized:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "-XXX" -offset indent -compact
.It Fl a
Prompt for the root filesystem device after the devices have been configured.
.It Fl b
On the next system reboot, always halt the system, even if a reboot is
required.
.It Fl c
Enter the
.Dq User Kernel Configuration
mode upon startup
.Pq see Xr boot_config 8 .
.It Fl d
Enter the debugger,
.Xr ddb 4 ,
as soon as the kernel console has been initialized.
.It Fl s
Boot the system single-user.
The system will be booted multi-user unless this option is specified.
.El
.Pp
If the user does not enter anything after a few seconds, the bootloader
will attempt to boot
.Pa /bsd
from the device it was loaded from, with no options.
.Ss Abnormal system termination
In case of system crashes, the kernel will usually enter the kernel
debugger,
.Xr ddb 4 ,
unless it is not present in the kernel, or it is disabled via the
.Em ddb.panic
sysctl.
Upon leaving ddb, or if ddb was not entered, the kernel will halt the system
if it was still in device configuration phase, or attempt a dump to the
configured dump device, if possible.
The crash dump will then be recovered by
.Xr savecore 8
during the next multi-user boot cycle.
It is also possible to force other behaviours from ddb.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /usr/mdec/bootxx.lif -compact
.It Pa /bsd
default system kernel
.It Pa /bsd.rd
standalone installation kernel, suitable for disaster recovery
.It Pa /usr/mdec/uboot.lif
.Tn LIF
format boot block, suitable for all bootable devices
.It Pa /usr/mdec/cdboot.lif
.Tn LIF
format boot block, suitable for bootable CD-ROM.

@Neither .Pp nor unqualified text are allowed at the top level of .Bl;
instead, .It is required.  Thus, move .Pp and text before the .Bl,
and remove the .Pp altogether where it is not needed.

Syntax errors found by mandoc(1), also required to fix the mandoc build;
feedback and ok jmc@@, and sobrado@@ also supports the direction.

.Ss Power fail and crash recovery
Normally, the system will reboot itself at power-up or after crashes.
An automatic consistency check of the file systems will be performed,
and unless this fails, the system will resume multi-user operations.

On an HP300, the boot procedure uses the boot ROM to load a boot program
from an
d55 7
a61 1
format directory at the beginning of an attached disk.
d63 14
a76 36
.Pa /usr/mdec
directory contains a disk boot program
.Pa ( /usr/mdec/bootsd
or
.Pa /usr/mdec/boothd )
which is placed on a
new disk automatically by
.Xr disklabel 8
when the
partitions of the disk are setup.
.Pp
This boot program
finds the corresponding file on the given device
.Pf ( Ar bsd
by default),
loads that file into memory,
and starts the program at the entry address specified in the program header.
.Pp
The boot program can be interrupted by typing ^C (ctrl-C).
This will force the boot program to interactively prompt for a system to boot.
If not interrupted, it will boot from the device from which the boot
program itself was loaded.
.Pp
The file specifications used for an interactive boot are of the form:
.Pp
.Dl device(unit, minor)
.Pp
where
.Ar device
is the type of the device to be searched,
.Ar unit
is 8 * the hpib number plus the unit number of the disk or tape,
and
.Ar minor
is the disk partition or tape file number.
Normal line editing characters can be used when typing the file specification.
