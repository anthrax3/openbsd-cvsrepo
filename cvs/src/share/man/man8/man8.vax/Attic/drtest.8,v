.Sh NAME
.Nm drtest
.Nd stand-alone disk test program
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Drtest
is a stand-alone program used to read a disk
track by track.
It was primarily intended as a test program
for new stand-alone drivers, but has proved
useful in other contexts as well, such as
verifying disks and running speed
tests.
For example, when a disk has been formatted (by
.Xr format 8 ) ,
you can check that
hard errors have been taken care of by running
.Nm drtest .
No hard errors should be found, but in many cases
quite a few soft
.Tn ECC
errors will be reported.
.Pp
While
.Nm drtest
is running, the cylinder number is printed on
the console for every 10th cylinder read.
.Sh EXAMPLES
A sample run of
.Nm
is shown below.
In this example (using a 750),
.Nm drtest
is loaded from the root file system;
usually it
will be loaded from the machine's
console storage device.
Boldface means user input.
As usual, ``#'' and ``@@'' may be used to edit input.

.Li Test program for stand-alone up and hp driver

.Li Debugging level (1=bse, 2=ecc, 3=bse+ecc)?
.Li Enter disk name [type(adapter,unit),\ e.g.\ hp(1,3)]? Sy hp(0,0)
.Li Device data: #cylinders=1024, #tracks=16, #sectors=32
.Li Testing hp(0,0), chunk size is 16384 bytes.
.Em (chunk\ size\ is\ the\ number\ of\ bytes read per disk access)
.Li Start ...Make sure hp(0,0) is online
.Li \ ...
.Em (errors are reported as they occur)
.Li \ ...
.Em (...program restarts to allow checking other disks)
.Em (...to abort halt machine with \&^P)
.Ed
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
The diagnostics are intended to be self explanatory.
Note, however, that the device number in the diagnostic messages
is identified as
.Em typeX
instead of
.Em type(a,u)
where
.Ar X
\&= a*8+u, e.g., hp(1,3) becomes hp11.

Ok, so there could be a cost/benefit debate with this commit, but since I have
the patch we might as well commit it...
