@amiga and sun3 turned out to not be y2k+3 compliant here. Remove them, as
well as the few userland tools which were only used on these platforms.

.Sh NAME
.Nm MAKEDEV
.Nd create system and device special files
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm MAKEDEV
.Ar name
.Op Ar ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The shell script
.Nm MAKEDEV ,
found in the
.Pa /dev
directory, is used to create the common special files.
See
.Xr intro 4
for a more complete discussion of special files.
.Pp
.Nm MAKEDEV
takes any number of device names as arguments, where the names are
the common abbreviation for the device.
There are three special device names,
.Ar all ,
.Ar std
and
.Ar local .
If
given,
.Ar all
creates device files for all devices on the Amiga.
If units are expected for a device,
.Nm MAKEDEV
will supply the standard numbers.
The
.Ar std
argument creates only the standard devices for the Amiga.
Finally
.Ar local
is for devices specific to the local site, and executes the shell file
.Pa MAKEDEV.local .
.Pp
The Amiga supports the following devices.
Where a device name is followed by a hash sign ("#"), the hash sign
must be replaced by a unit number.

@Harmonize MAKEDEV.8 manpages, and provide one for arches still lacking it.
Remove bogus/obsolete information in the way (hello, hp300 MAKEDEV.8!)
This has been lying for a long time in my tree, but much more work will be
needed until these pages are complete - watch out for more m4 madness to
generate them in the future.
