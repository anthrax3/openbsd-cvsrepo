.Dt COMPAT_BSDOS 8
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm compat_bsdos
.Nd setup for running BSDI binaries under emulation
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Ox
supports the execution of BSDI binaries; most binaries should
work, at least from the BSDI 2.1 era.
Some things that are not currently
supported are proprietary extensions made to the BSDI kernel.
.Pp
To activate the BSDI compatibility feature, the kernel must be compiled
with the
.Nm COMPAT_BSDOS
option and the kern.emul.bsdos
.Xr sysctl 8
enabled.
.Pp
.Nm COMPAT_BSDOS
follows the standard
.Dq emul
filesystem scheme, using
.Pa /emul/bsdos
as the prefix.
This means that all BSDI executables first look in
.Pa /emul/bsdos
whenever opening a file; configuration information, shared library images,
etc., for BSDI binaries should all be installed under the emulation
directory in order to avoid conflicts with native files.
.Pp
Although many commercial BSDI binaries are
.Dq pure
(in that they need no shared libraries), system binaries and those
compiled/linked with the BSDI
.\" no .Xr here because we don't have junk like shlicc.
.Nm shlicc
program require the appropriate shared library images.
These may be found in the
.Pa /shlib
directory on a BSDI system, and must be copied to
.Pa /emul/bsdos/shlib
in order for such binaries to work.
The user is responsible for having the appropriate BSDI licenses in order
to use the shared library images.
.Sh BUGS
If BSDI ever manages to port their system to more architectures or switch
to real dynamically linked libraries these instructions may have to change.
.Pp
.Nm COMPAT_BSDOS
is currently only supported on the i386.
