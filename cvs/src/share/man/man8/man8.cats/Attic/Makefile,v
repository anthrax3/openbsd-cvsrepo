1.3
log
@Retire OpenBSD/cats. Hardware is nice but prone to catch fire, and the firmware
is anything but useful. Nevertheless this was a very good platform to use as
an OpenBSD/*arm* starting point, but nowadays this platform is not necessary
anymore.

Somehow these CATS motherboard are just like AUI hubs, with the difference that,
when my AUI hub caught fire, 10base5 support was not removed from the networking
code.
