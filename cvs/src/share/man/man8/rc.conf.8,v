.Dt RC.CONF 8
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm rc.conf ,
.Nm rc.conf.local
.Nd system daemon configuration database
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The file
.Nm rc.conf
contains a series of variable assignments that are used to configure
the system daemons.
These variables are read by
.Xr rc 8
early on in the boot sequence and every time an
.Xr rc.d 8
script is executed.
.Pp
It is advisable to leave
.Nm rc.conf
untouched, and instead create and edit a new
.Nm rc.conf.local
file or use the
.Xr rcctl 8
utility.
Since only the last assignment to any variable takes effect,
variables set in this file override variables previously set in
.Nm rc.conf .
.Pp
.Nm rc.conf
is made up of variable assignments
.Pq Ar variable Ns = Ns Ar value
with comments designated by a hash mark
.Pq Sq # .
.Pp
.Sy Base system daemon
configuration variables are used to enable and disable daemon programs
that are installed by default, and to set their command line options.
.Pp
All of these variables follow the format
.Dq Ar daemon Ns _flags
where
.Ar daemon
is the name of one of the
.Xr rc.d 8
daemon control scripts.
The list of base system daemons, including the information whether
they are enabled by default, can be displayed with this command:
.Pp
.Dl grep _flags /etc/rc.conf
.Pp
If one of these variables is set to
.Cm NO ,
the respective
.Ar daemon
is disabled.
If set to the empty string, the
.Ar daemon
is run with the default command line arguments defined in its
.Xr rc.d 8
.Ar daemon
script, or without command line arguments if no such default exists.
If set to any other value, including a string containing
only a single blank character, the
.Ar daemon
is run with those command line arguments.
.Pp
.Sy Package daemon
configuration variables are used to enable and disable
daemon programs installed from
.Xr packages 7 ,
and to set their command line options.
.Pp
The special
.Cm pkg_scripts
variable lists
.Xr rc.d 8
.Ar daemon
control scripts to be started in the specified order.
For each
.Ar daemon
listed, its default command line options can optionally be overridden
using the variable
.Ar daemon Ns _flags
as described above.
.Pp
.Sy Base system service
configuration variables control features available by default
that are not implemented as daemons.
They can be set to either
.Cm YES
or
.Cm NO .
When set to
.Cm YES ,
they have the following effects:
.Bl -tag -width check_quotas
.It Cm accounting
rc calls:
.Xr accton 8
.Pa /var/account/acct
.It Cm check_quotas
rc calls:
.Xr quotacheck 8
.Fl a ;
.Xr quotaon 8
.Fl a
.It Cm ipsec
rc calls:
.Xr ipsecctl 8
.Fl f Pa /etc/ipsec.conf
.It Cm multicast
See
.Xr netstart 8 .
.It Cm pf
rc calls:
.Xr pfctl 8
.Fl ef Pa /etc/pf.conf
.It Cm spamd_black
The script
.Pa /etc/rc.d/spamd
uses
.Fl b
in front of any other configured command line arguments when running
.Xr spamd 8
and
.Xr spamd-setup 8 .
.El
.Pp
.Sy Auxiliary
configuration variables mostly determine
the locations of specific configuration files.
The boot scripts use them as follows:
.Bl -tag -width amd_master
.It Cm amd_master
The
.Xr amd 8
master map file.
The script
.Pa /etc/rc.d/amd
appends its content to the command line when starting the auto mounter daemon.
.It Cm shlib_dirs
Extra shared library search path entries.
rc calls:
.Xr ldconfig 8
.Pa /usr/X11R6/lib
.Pa /usr/local/lib
.Pf $ Brq Ar shlib_dirs
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
Do not start the
.Xr dhcpd 8
daemon when booting the system:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
dhcpd_flags=NO
.Ed
.Pp
To run the dhcpd daemon,
add the following line to
.Nm rc.conf.local :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
dhcpd_flags=
.Ed
.Pp
To start it with some options:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
dhcpd_flags=-A abandoned
.Ed
.Pp
Run
.Pa /etc/rc.d/messagebus
then
.Pa /etc/rc.d/cupsd
with the
.Cm start
argument at boot time,
and in reverse order with the
.Cm stop
argument at shutdown:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
pkg_scripts=messagebus cupsd
.Ed
.Pp
The default location of the
.Xr amd 8
master map file is:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
amd_master=/etc/amd/master	# AMD 'master' map
.Ed
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr init 8 ,
.Xr intro 8 ,
.Xr rc 8 ,
.Xr rc.d 8 ,
.Xr rcctl 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
file first appeared in
.Ox 2.2 .

Variables set in this file will override variables previously set in
d64 140
a203 2
Some variables are used to turn features on or off.
For example, whether the system runs the
d205 1
a205 1
daemon is determined by the following line:
d217 1
a217 3
If instead some options are specified,
then the dhcpd daemon will be started with those options.
For example:
d222 1
a222 20
Other variables specify a simple YES or NO,
or simply determine the location of a file.
For example, the location of the ruleset for
.Xr pf 4
is given thus:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
pf_rules=/etc/pf.conf           # Packet filter rules file
.Ed
.Pp
Finally there is the
.Va pkg_scripts
variable, responsible for starting and stopping
.Xr rc.d 8
scripts installed by packages in the specified order.
For example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
pkg_scripts=dbus_daemon cupsd
.Ed
.Pp
This will run
d227 1
a227 1
.Va start
d230 12

.Va stop

There are four sections in this file.
The first is used to turn features on or off.

.Nm dhcpd
daemon is determined by the line in this section
d61 1
a61 1
dhcpd_flags=NO		# for normal use: ""

If this line is edited to contain some valid dhcpd daemon command-line
flags, such as
d68 1
a68 1
dhcpd_flags="-A abandoned"	# for normal use: ""
d71 1
d73 1
a73 5
.Pp
The second section contains some other programs that can either be run or not,
but that don't need options.
They can be set to YES or NO.
For example, the line
d75 1
a75 1
nfs_server=NO
d78 5
a82 14
prevents the NFS server daemons from starting.
To run NFS, just change this line's value from NO to YES,
.Sy and
also make whatever changes are needed for the server
to have something to do (set up the
.Xr exports 5
file etc.).
.Pp
The third section contains values that parameterize servers started by
one of the first two sections, and are ignored if the corresponding
server is not running.
For example, if
.Nm nfs_server ,
is enabled, then the line
d84 1
a84 1
nfsd_flags="-tun 4"
d87 1
a87 8
provides command-line arguments for the NFS server.
.Pp
This particular line instructs
.Xr nfsd 8
to start four copies of the server.
On a busy file server, 8 (or more) copies are recommended.
.Pp
The fourth section contains the
d92 1
a92 1
For example, the following line
d97 1
a97 1
will run
d103 2
a104 1
argument at boot time and in reverse order with the

- fix remaining .Nm usage as well
- this is from a patch I received from kwesterback@@home.com, who has been
  working on some scripts for fixing formatting errors in mdoc'd man pages

Ok, so there could be a cost/benefit debate with this commit, but since I have
the patch we might as well commit it...

@The proper order of the ``introductory'' macros in a man page is .Dd/.Dt/.Os.
Out of the approximately 1450 man pages, only about 90 of them were wrong.
Thanks to kwesterback@@home.com for coming up with a script and patch to repair
this. The patch also inserted a .Os macro in the few man pages that were
missing one.

There are three sections to the file. The first is used to turn features
on or off. For example, whether your system runs the 
d52 1
a52 1
If you edit this line to contain some valid sendmail daemon command-line
d62 1
a62 1
the distributed system contains the line
d67 7
a73 5
which prevents the NFS server daemons from starting. If you wish to 
run NFS, you need to change this line's value from NO to YES,
.Sy plus
you also need to make whatever changes are needed for the server
to have something to do (like, set up the exports file).
d77 1
a77 1
server is not running. For example, if you enabled 
d79 1
a79 1
you should also be aware of the value here
d83 1
d85 4
a88 2
which starts four copies of the server; on a busy file server you'd
probably change to 8 or more.
