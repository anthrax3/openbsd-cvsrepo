.Dt BOOT_ALPHA 8 alpha
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm boot_alpha
.Nd Alpha system bootstrapping procedures
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Ss Cold starts
When powered on, the SRM firmware will proceed to its initialization, and
will boot an operating system if the
.Em auto_action
variable is set to
.Dq boot
or
.Dq restart ,
or will wait for interactive commands if set to
.Dq halt .
.Ss Warm starts
After a panic, or if the system is rebooted via
.Xr reboot 8
or
.Xr shutdown 8 ,
the SRM console will only restart the system if the
.Em auto_action
variable is set to
.Dq boot .
.Ss Boot process options
The SRM console will attempt to boot a kernel named from the
.Em boot_file
environment variable, on the device listed in the
.Em bootdef_dev
variable.
A list of the recognized SRM devices can be obtained with the command
.Ic show dev
at the SRM prompt.
If the
.Em boot_file
variable is not set or empty,
.Pa /bsd
will be used by default.
.Pp
The kernel will be passed the options listed in the
.Em boot_osflags
variable.
Option letters are case insensitive.
The following option letters are recognized:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "XXX" -offset indent -compact
.It Cm a
Boot the system multi-user.
This is the default behaviour of the kernel if no flags are specified.
.It Cm b
Enter the debugger,
.Xr ddb 4 ,
as soon as the kernel console has been initialized.
.It Cm c
Enter the
.Dq User Kernel Configuration
mode upon startup
.Pq Xr boot_config 8 .
.It Cm d
Create a kernel crash dump immediately after the devices have been configured.
This option is only available on kernels compiled with
.Qq option DEBUG .
.It Cm h
On the next system reboot, always halt the system, even if a reboot is
required.
.It Cm n
Prompt for the root filesystem device after the devices have been configured.
.It Cm s
Boot the system single-user.
.El
.Ss Abnormal system termination
In case of system crashes, the kernel will usually enter the kernel
debugger,
.Xr ddb 4 ,
unless it is not present in the kernel, or it is disabled via the
.Em ddb.panic
sysctl.
Upon leaving ddb, or if ddb was not entered, the kernel will halt the system
if it was still in device configuration phase, or attempt a dump to the
configured dump device, if possible.
The crash dump will then be recovered by
.Xr savecore 8
during the next multi-user boot cycle.
It is also possible to force other behaviours from ddb.
.Sh FILES

When the

.Ns Tn /alpha
kernel is booted normally
it initializes itself and proceeds to start the system.
An automatic consistency check of the file systems takes place, and unless
this fails, the system comes up to multi-user operation.
The proper way to shut the system down is with the
.Xr shutdown 8
command.

If the system crashes, it will enter the kernel debugger,
d100 7
a106 7
if it is configured in the kernel.
If the crash occurred during
initialization and the debugger is not present or is exited, the
kernel will halt the system.
If the crash occurred during normal operation and the debugger
is not present or is exited, the system will attempt a dump to the
configured dump device (which will be automatically recovered with
d108 2
a109 20
during the next boot cycle), and after the dump is complete (successful
or not) the kernel will attempt a reboot.
