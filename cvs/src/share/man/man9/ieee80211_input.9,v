.Sh DESCRIPTION
These
functions process received 802.11 frames.
.Pp
.\"
The
.Fn ieee80211_input
function takes an mbuf chain
.Fa m
containing a complete 802.11 frame from the driver
.Fa ifp
and passes it to the software 802.11 stack for input processing.
The
.Fa ni
argument specifies an instance of
.Vt struct ieee80211_node
(which may be driver-specific) representing the node from which the
frame was received.
The arguments
.Fa rssi
and
.Fa stamp
are typically derived from on-card data structures; they are used for
recording the signal strength and time received of the frame respectively.
.Pp
.\"
The
.Fn ieee80211_decap
function performs decapsulation of the 802.11 frame in the mbuf chain
.Fa m
received by the device
.Fa ifp ,
taking the form of the 802.11 address fields into account;
the structure of 802.11 addresses vary according to the intended
source and destination of the frame.
It is typically called from within
.Fn ieee80211_input .
.Pp
.\"
The
.Fn ieee80211_recv_mgmt
performs input processing for 802.11 management frames.
It is typically called from within
.Fn ieee80211_input .

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm ieee80211
series of functions first appeared in
.Nx 1.5 ,
and were later ported to
.Fx 4.6
and
.Ox 3.6 .
