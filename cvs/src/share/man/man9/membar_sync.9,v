.Nd memory access barrier operations
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/atomic.h
.Ft void
.Fn membar_enter "void"
.Ft void
.Fn membar_exit "void"
.Ft void
.Fn membar_producer "void"
.Ft void
.Fn membar_consumer "void"

.Fn membar_sync "void"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The membar set of functions provide an interface for issuing memory barrier
access operations with respect to multiple processors in the system.
.Bl -tag -width "mem"
.It Fn membar_enter
Any store preceding
.Fn membar_enter
will reach global visibility before all loads and stores following it.
.Pp
.Fn membar_enter
is typically used in code that implements locking primitives to ensure
that a lock protects its data.
.It Fn membar_exit
All loads and stores preceding
.Fn membar_exit
will reach global visibility before any store that follows it.
.Pp
.Fn membar_exit
is typically used in code that implements locking primitives to ensure
that a lock protects its data.
.It Fn membar_producer
All stores preceding the memory barrier will reach global visibility
before any stores after the memory barrier reach global visibility.
.It Fn membar_consumer
All loads preceding the memory barrier will complete before any loads
after the memory barrier complete.
.It Fn membar_sync
All loads and stores preceding the memory barrier will complete and
reach global visibility before any loads and stores after the memory
barrier complete and reach global visibility.
.El
.Sh CONTEXT
.Fn membar_enter ,
.Fn membar_exit ,
.Fn membar_producer ,
.Fn membar_consumer ,
.Fn membar_sync
can all be called during autoconf, from process context, or from interrupt context.
.Sh HISTORY
The membar functions first appeared in
.Nx 5.0
and
.Ox 5.5 .

@rename membar.9 to membar_sync.9 because manpages have to be named after
functions FOR REASONS.
