.Sh NAME
.Nm psignal ,
.Nm pgsignal ,
.Nm gsignal
.Nd post signal to a process
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Ft void
.Fn psignal "struct proc *p" "int signum"
.Ft void
.Fn pgsignal "struct pgrp *pgrp" "int signum" "int checkctty"
.Ft void
.Fn gsignal "int pgid" "int signum"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
These functions post a signal to one or more processes.
The argument
.Fa signum
common to all three functions should be in the range
.Bq 1- Ns Dv NSIG .
.Pp
The
.Fn psignal
function posts signal number
.Fa signum
to the process represented by the process structure
.Fa p .
With a few exceptions noted below, the target process signal disposition is
updated and is marked as runnable, so further handling of the signal is done
in the context of the target process after a context switch.
Note that
.Fn psignal
does not by itself cause a context switch to happen.
.Pp
The target process is not marked as runnable in the following cases:
.Bl -bullet -offset indent
.It
The target process is sleeping uninterruptibly.
The signal will be
noticed when the process returns from the system call or trap.
.It
The target process is currently ignoring the signal.
.It
If a stop signal is sent to a sleeping process that takes the
default action
.Pq see Xr sigaction 2 ,
the process is stopped without awakening it.
.It
.Dv SIGCONT
restarts a stopped process
.Pq or puts them back to sleep
regardless of the signal action
.Pq e.g., blocked or ignored .
.El
.Pp
If the target process is being traced,
.Fn psignal
behaves as if the target process were taking the default action for
.Fa signum .
This allows the tracing process to be notified of the signal.
.Pp
The
.Fn pgsignal
function posts signal number
.Fa signum
to each member of the process group described by
.Fa pgrp .
If
.Fa checkctty
is non-zero, the signal will be posted only to processes that have
a controlling terminal.
If
.Fa pgrp
is
.Dv NULL
no action is taken.
.Pp
The
.Fn gsignal
function posts signal number
.Fa signum
to each member of the process group identified by the group id
.Fa pgid .
If
.Fa pgid
is zero no action is taken.
.Sh CODE REFERENCES
These functions are implemented in the file
.Pa sys/kern/kern_sig.c .

log
@First pass at removing clauses 3 and 4 from NetBSD licenses.

Not sure what's more surprising: how long it took for NetBSD to
catch up to the rest of the BSDs (including UCB), or the amount of
code that NetBSD has claimed for itself without attributing to the
actual authors.
