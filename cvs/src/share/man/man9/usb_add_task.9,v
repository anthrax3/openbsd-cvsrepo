.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In dev/usb/usbdi.h
.Ft void
.Fn usb_add_task "struct usbd_device *dev" "struct usb_task *task"
.Ft void
.Fn usb_rem_task "struct usbd_device *dev" "struct usb_task *task"
.Ft void
.Fn usb_wait_task "struct usbd_device *dev" "struct usb_task *task"
.Ft void
.Fn usb_rem_wait_task "struct usbd_device *dev" "struct usb_task *task"
.Ft void
.Fn usb_init_task "struct usbd_device *dev" "void (*fn)(void *)" "void *arg" "char type"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The USB stack provides an API to manage task execution in a thread context at
the soonest opportunity.
There are three different task queues
that are executed on two separate threads.
All tasks executed via the USB task API are
serialized with USB events such as device detachments.
.Pp
The
.Fn usb_add_task
function enqueues a task to be executed by the task thread.
Subsequent calls to
.Fn usb_add_task
will not result in multiple executions being scheduled.
The task structure must already be initialised by
.Fn usb_init_task .
.Pp
The
.Fn usb_rem_task
function removes a scheduled task from its queue.
If the work was already executed or has not been added to the task queue,
the call will have no effect.
Calling
.Fn usb_rem_task
while the task is executing will not abort it.
.Pp
The
.Fn usb_wait_task
function sleeps until the given task is neither queued for execution
nor currently running.
.Pp
The
.Fn usb_rem_wait_task
function is the equivalent of calling
.Fn usb_rem_task
followed by
.Fn usb_wait_task .
.Pp
The
.Fn usb_init_task
macro prepares the task structure
.Fa task
to be used in future calls to
.Fn usb_add_task ,
.Fn usb_rem_task ,
.Fn usb_wait_task ,
and
.Fn usb_rem_wait_task .
.Fa task
will be prepared to call the function
.Fa fn
with the argument specified by
.Fa arg .
The
.Fa type
of the task determines the queue
and thread that will be used for its execution:
.Bl -tag -width "USB_TASK_TYPE_EXPLORE" -offset indent
.It Dv USB_TASK_TYPE_GENERIC
Tasks used for general work that need to happen in a process context.
.It Dv USB_TASK_TYPE_EXPLORE
Device discovery tasks exploring the tree from the root.
.It Dv USB_TASK_TYPE_ABORT
Tasks of this type execute on a dedicated thread
not shared with other USB task types.
.El
.Pp
Most drivers will only define tasks of type
.Dv USB_TASK_TYPE_GENERIC .
Note that
.Dv USB_TASK_TYPE_ABORT
tasks are only used by host controller drivers
and should never be used by drivers.
Once initialised, the
.Fa task
can be used repeatedly in the API functions listed above
and does not need to be reinitialised
unless the function called and/or its argument must change.
.Sh CONTEXT
.Fn usb_task_add
can be called from any context.
