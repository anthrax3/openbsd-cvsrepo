.Dt CONFIG_ATTACH 9
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm config_attach ,
.Nm config_detach ,
.Nm config_detach_children
.Nd attach and detach devices
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/param.h
.In sys/device.h
.Ft "struct device *"
.Fn config_attach "struct device *parent" "void *cf" "void *aux" \
                  "cfprint_t print"
.Ft "int"
.Fn config_detach "struct device *dev" "int flags"
.Ft "int"
.Fn config_detach_children "struct device *parent" "int flags"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn config_attach
function attaches a found device.
Memory is allocated for the
.Em softc
structure and the driver's attach function is called according to the
configuration table.
If successful,
.Fn config_attach
returns the
.Em softc .
If unsuccessful, it returns
.Dv NULL .
.Pp
The
.Fn config_detach
function is called by the parent to detach the child device.
The second argument
.Fa flags
contains detachment flags:
.Bd -literal
#define	DETACH_FORCE	0x01	/* Force detachment; hardware gone */
#define	DETACH_QUIET	0x02	/* Don't print a notice */
.Ed
.Sh CONTEXT
.Fn config_detach
is always called from process context, allowing
.Xr tsleep 9
to be called while the device detaches itself (to deal with processes
which have a device open).
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn config_detach
returns zero if successful and an error code otherwise.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr config_found 9

@Split config_attach/detach(9) from autoconf(9).  Stop talking about
config_deactivate(9), it should die.  Mention config_detach_children(9).
Use CONTEXT and RETURN VALUES sections
