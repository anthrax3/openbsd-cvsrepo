.Sh DESCRIPTION
I2C is a two-wire bus developed by Philips used for connecting
integrated circuits.
It is commonly used for connecting devices such as EEPROMs,
temperature sensors, fan controllers, real-time clocks, tuners,
and other types of integrated circuits.
The
.Nm iic
interface provides a means of communicating with I2C-connected devices.
The System Management Bus, or SMBus, is a variant of the I2C bus with
a simplified command protocol and some electrical differences.
.Sh DATA TYPES
Drivers for devices attached to the I2C bus will make use of the
following data types:
.Bl -tag -width i2c_addr_t
.It Fa i2c_tag_t
Controller tag for the I2C bus.
This is a pointer to a
.Fa struct i2c_controller ,
consisting of function pointers filled in by the I2C
controller driver.
.It Fa i2c_op_t
I2C bus operation.
The following I2C bus operations are defined:
.Bl -tag -width XXXX
.It I2C_OP_READ
Perform a read operation.
.It I2C_OP_READ_WITH_STOP
Perform a read operation and send a STOP condition on the I2C bus at
the conclusion of the read.
.It I2C_OP_WRITE
Perform a write operation.
.It I2C_OP_WRITE_WITH_STOP
Perform a write operation and send a STOP condition on the I2C bus at
the conclusion of the write.
.El
.It Fa i2c_addr_t
I2C device address.
.It Fa struct i2c_attach_args
Devices are attached to an I2C bus using this structure.
The structure is defined as follows:
.Bd -literal
struct i2c_attach_args {
	i2c_tag_t ia_tag;	/* controller */
	i2c_addr_t ia_addr;	/* address of device */
	int ia_size;		/* size (for EEPROMs) */
	char *ia_name;		/* chip name */
	void *ia_cookie;	/* pass extra info from
				   bus to dev */
};
.Ed
.El
.Sh FUNCTIONS
The following functions comprise the API provided to drivers of
I2C-connected devices:
.Bl -tag -width iic_exec
.It Fn iic_acquire_bus "ic" "flags"
Acquire an exclusive lock on the I2C bus.
This is required since only one device may communicate on the
I2C bus at a time.
Drivers should acquire the bus lock, perform the I2C bus operations
necessary, and then release the bus lock.
Passing the
.Fa I2C_F_POLL
flag indicates to
.Fn iic_acquire_bus
that sleeping is not permitted.
.It Fn iic_release_bus "ic" "flags"
Release an exclusive lock on the I2C bus.
If the
.Fa I2C_F_POLL
flag was passed to
.Fn iic_acquire_bus ,
it must also be passed to
.Fn iic_release_bus .
.It Xo
.Fo iic_exec
.Fa "ic"
.Fa "op"
.Fa "addr"
.Fa "cmdbuf"
.Fa "cmdlen"
.Fa "buf"
.Fa "len"
.Fa "flags"
.Fc
.Xc
Perform a series of I2C transactions on the bus.
.Fn iic_exec
initiates the operation by sending a START condition on the I2C
bus and then transmitting the address of the target device along
with the transaction type.
If
.Fa cmdlen
is non-zero, the command pointed to by
.Fa cmdbuf
is then sent to the device.
If
.Fa buflen
is non-zero,
.Fn iic_exec
will then transmit or receive the data, as indicated by
.Fa op .
If
.Fa op
indicates a read operation,
.Fn iic_exec
will send a REPEATED START before transferring the data.
If
.Fa op
so indicates, a STOP condition will be sent on the I2C
bus at the conclusion of the operation.
Passing the
.Fa I2C_F_POLL
flag indicates to
.Fn iic_exec
that sleeping is not permitted.
.It Fn iic_smbus_write_byte "ic" "addr" "cmd" "data" "flags"
Perform an SMBus WRITE BYTE operation.
This is equivalent to
I2C_OP_WRITE_WITH_STOP with
.Fa cmdlen
of 1 and
.Fa len
of 1.
.It Fn iic_smbus_read_byte "ic" "addr" "cmd" "datap" "flags"
Perform an SMBus READ BYTE operation.
This is equivalent to
I2C_OP_READ_WITH_STOP with
.Fa cmdlen
of 1 and
.Fa len
of 1.
.It Fn iic_smbus_receive_byte "ic" "addr" "datap" "flags"
Perform an SMBus RECEIVE BYTE operation.
This is equivalent to
I2C_OP_READ_WITH_STOP with
.Fa cmdlen
of 0 and
.Fa len
of 1.
.El
.Sh CONTROLLER INTERFACE
The I2C controller driver must fill in the function pointers of
an
.Fa i2c_controller
structure, which is defined as follows:
.Bd -literal
struct i2c_controller {
	void	*ic_cookie;	/* controller private */

	int	(*ic_acquire_bus)(void *, int);
	void	(*ic_release_bus)(void *, int);

	int	(*ic_exec)(void *, i2c_op_t, i2c_addr_t,
		   const void *, size_t, void *, size_t, int);

	int	(*ic_send_start)(void *, int);
	int	(*ic_send_stop)(void *, int);
	int	(*ic_initiate_xfer)(void *, i2c_addr_t, int);
	int	(*ic_read_byte)(void *, uint8_t *, int);
	int	(*ic_write_byte)(void *, uint8_t, int);
};
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Fn (*ic_acquire_bus)
and
.Fn (*ic_release_bus)
functions must always be provided.
.Pp
The controller driver may elect to provide an
.Fn (*ic_exec)
function.
This function is intended for use by automated controllers
that do not provide manual control over I2C bus conditions
such as START and STOP.
.Pp
If the
.Fn (*ic_exec)
function is not provided, the following 5 functions will be
used by
.Fn iic_exec
in order to execute the I2C bus operation:
.Bl -tag -width XXXX
.It Fn (*ic_send_start) "cookie" "flags"
Send a START condition on the I2C bus.
The
.Fa I2C_F_POLL
flag indicates that sleeping is not permitted.
.It Fn (*ic_send_stop) "cookie" "flags"
Send a STOP condition on the I2C bus.
The
.Fa I2C_F_POLL
flag indicates that sleeping is not permitted.
.It Fn (*ic_initiate_xfer) "cookie" "addr" "flags"
Initiate a transfer on the I2C bus by sending a START condition and
then transmitting the I2C device address and transfer type.
The
.Fa I2C_F_READ
flag indicates a read transfer; the lack of this flag indicates a
write transfer.
The
.Fa I2C_F_POLL
flag indicates that sleeping is not permitted.
The error code
.Dv ETIMEDOUT
should be returned if a timeout that would indicate that the
device is not present occurs.
.It Fn (*ic_read_byte) "cookie" "datap" "flags"
Read a byte from the I2C bus into the memory location referenced by
.Fa datap .
The
.Fa I2C_F_LAST
flag indicates that this is the final byte of the transfer, and that
a NACK condition should be sent on the I2C bus following the transfer
of the byte.
The
.Fa I2C_F_STOP
flag indicates that a STOP condition should be sent on the I2C bus following
the transfer of the byte.
The
.Fa I2C_F_POLL
flag indicates that sleeping is not permitted.
.It Fn (*ic_write_byte) "cookie" "data" "flags"
Write the byte contained in
.Fa data
to the I2C bus.
The
.Fa I2C_F_STOP
flag indicates that a STOP condition should be sent on the I2C bus following
the transfer of the byte.
The
.Fa I2C_F_POLL
flag indicates that sleeping is not permitted.
