.Dt INITTODR 9
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm inittodr
.Nd initialize system time
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Ft void
.Fn inittodr "time_t base"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn inittodr
function determines the time and sets the system clock.
It tries to pick the correct time using a set of heuristics that examine
the system's battery-backed clock and the time reported by the file
system, as given in
.Fa base .
Those heuristics include:
.Bl -bullet
.It
If the battery-backed clock has a valid time, it is used.
.It
If the battery-backed clock does not have a valid time, and
the time provided in
.Fa base
is within reason,
.Fa base
is used as the current time.
.It
If the battery-backed clock appears invalid, and
.Fa base
appears nonsensical or was not provided (was given as zero),
an arbitrary base (typically some time in the late 1970s)
will be used.
.El
.Pp
Once a system time has been determined, it is passed to the
.Fn tc_setclock
function.
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
The
.Fn inittodr
function prints diagnostic messages if it has trouble figuring
out the system time.
Conditions that can cause diagnostic messages to be printed include:
.Bl -bullet
.It
The battery-backed clock's time appears nonsensical.
.It
The
.Fa base
time appears nonsensical.
.It
The
.Fa base
time and the battery-backed clock's time differ by a large amount.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr resettodr 9 ,
.Xr time_second 9
.Sh BUGS
Each system's heuristics for picking the correct time are slightly
different.

On many systems,
.Fn inittodr
has to convert from
a time expressed in terms of year, month, day, hours, minutes,
and seconds to
.Va time ,
expressed in seconds.
Many of the implementations could share code, but do not.

@- remove all trailing whitespace
     * except when it is escaped with a `\' at the end of the line
- fix remaining .Nm usage as well
- this is from a patch I received from kwesterback@@home.com, who has been
  working on some scripts for fixing formatting errors in mdoc'd man pages

Ok, so there could be a cost/benefit debate with this commit, but since I have
the patch we might as well commit it...
