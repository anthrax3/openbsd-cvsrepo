.Sh DESCRIPTION
The bufq API implements queueing and scheduling of I/O operations on disk
devices.
It provides multiple scheduling algorithms within the API.
.Pp
It is the responsibility of the disk device driver to provide
pre-allocated bufq structures.
.Pp
.Fn bufq_init
initialises the
.Fa bufq
structure and allocates any state required by the scheduling algorithm
by the
.Fa type
argument.
.Pp
.Fn bufq_switch
can be used to change the scheduler currently used by
.Fa bufq
to the algorithm specified by
.Fa type .
.Pp
The
.Fa type
argument to
.Fn bufq_init
and
.Fn bufq_switch
can be one of the following scheduling algorithms:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -offset indent -width BUFQ_DEFAULT -compact
.It Dv BUFQ_FIFO
A simple First-In First-Out queue.
.It Dv BUFQ_NSCAN
Takes batches of "N" bufs from the queue and sorts them for optimal
head movement.
.It Dv BUFQ_DEFAULT
This currently aliases
.Dv BUFQ_NSCAN .
.El
.Pp
.Fn bufq_destroy
frees any state that was used by the scheduler.
.Pp
.Fn bufq_queue
is used to add the buf specified by
.Fa bp
to the
.Fa bufq
queue.
.Pp
.Fn bufq_dequeue
is used to get the next buf the
.Fa bufq
has scheduled to be serviced by a disk.
The buf will be removed from the queue.
.Pp
.Fn bufq_requeue
can be used to return a previously dequeued buf specified by
.Fa bp
to the head of the queue of
.Fa bufq .
.Pp
.Fn bufq_peek
allows the caller to determine if there are more bufs queued on
.Fa bufq
without modifying the list of bufs.
.Pp
.Fn bufq_drain
is a convenience function for devices that have detached.
It removes all the bufs currently queued on
.Fa bufq ,
marks them as failed with an
.Er ENXIO
error, and returns them to the block layer via
.Xr biodone 9 .
.Sh CONTEXT
.Fn bufq_init ,
.Fn bufq_switch ,
and
.Fn bufq_destroy
can be called during autoconf, or from process context.
.Pp
.Nm bufq_queue ,
.Nm bufq_dequeue ,
.Nm bufq_requeue ,
.Nm bufq_peek ,
and
.Nm bufq_drain
can be called during autoconf, from process context, or from interrupt context.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn bufq_init
and
.Fn bufq_switch
will return 0 on success, or an error code as per
.Xr errno 2 .
.Pp
.Fn bufq_dequeue
returns the next buf that is scheduled to be serviced by the disk.
.Dv NULL
is returned if there are no bufs available on the queue.
.Pp
.Fn bufq_peek
returns 1 if there are bufs available to be scheduled on the disk, otherwise 0.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr errno 2 ,
.Xr autoconf 9 ,
.Xr biodone 9 ,
.Xr disk 9
.Sh HISTORY
The bufq API was written by
.An Thordur I. Bjornsson
and
.An David Gwynne Aq Mt dlg@@openbsd.org .
The bufq API first appeared in
.Ox 4.8
and finally succeeded in fully replacing disksort in
.Ox 5.5 .

log
@Remove useless quoting from .Fo and .Fn function names, to prevent
development of a cargo cult in case people look at existing files
for examples.  This achieves a consistent .Fo and .Fn quoting style
across the whole tree.
