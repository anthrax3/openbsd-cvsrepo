.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm dopowerhooks
.Nd run all power hooks
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/types.h
.In sys/systm.h
.Ft void
.Fn dopowerhooks "int why"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn dopowerhooks
calls all power hooks that have been established using
.Xr powerhook_establish 9 .
At
.Dq suspend
and
.Dq standby
time, power hooks are called in reverse order, i.e.,
the power hook established last will be called first.
At
.Dq resume
time, power hooks are called in order, i.e., the power hook
established first will be called first.
.Pp
.Fn dopowerhooks
is invoked by
.Xr acpi 4
or
.Xr apm 4
when a power state change is detected.
The
.Fa why
argument is one of
.Dv PWR_SUSPEND ,
.Dv PWR_STANDBY ,
or
.Dv PWR_RESUME ,
describing the reason for the change in power state.
Each established power hook is passed this information so the appropriate
actions can be taken.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr acpi 4 ,
.Xr apm 4 ,
.Xr powerhook_establish 9
