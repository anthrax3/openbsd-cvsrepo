.Dt DOSHUTDOWNHOOKS 9
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm doshutdownhooks
.Nd run all shutdown hooks
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/types.h
.In sys/systm.h
.Ft void
.Fn doshutdownhooks "void"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn doshutdownhooks
function invokes all shutdown hooks established using the
.Xr shutdownhook_establish 9
function.
Shutdown hooks are called in reverse order, i.e.,
the shutdown hook established last will be called first.
.Pp
This function is called from
.Xr boot 9
with interrupts turned off.
It is called immediately before the system is halted or rebooted,
after file systems have been unmounted, after the clock has been updated,
and after a system dump has been done (if necessary).
.Pp
Shutdown hooks are, like startup hooks, implemented via the more general
.Xr dohooks 9
API.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr boot 9 ,
.Xr dohooks 9 ,
.Xr domountroothooks 9 ,

@Startup hooks.  Can be used for providing root/swap devices from device
systems which want configuration to finish late, like I2O.  Implemented via
a general hooks mechanism which the shutdown hooks have been converted to
use as well.  It even has manpages!
