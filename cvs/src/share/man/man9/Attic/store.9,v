.Nm store
.Nd store data to user-space
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <sys/types.h>
.Fd #include <sys/systm.h>
.Ft int
.Fn subyte "void *base" "unsigned char c"
.Ft int
.Fn susword "void *base" "unsigned short s"
.Ft int
.Fn suswintr "void *base" "unsigned short s"
.Ft int
.Fn suword "void *base" "unsigned long l"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
functions are designed to copy small amounts of data to user-space.
.Pp
The
.Nm
routines provide the following functionality:
.Bl -tag -width "suswintr()"
.It Fn subyte
Stores a byte of data,
.Pa c ,
to the user-space address
.Pa base .
.It Fn susword
Stores a short word of data,
.Pa s ,
to the user-space address
.Pa base .
.It Fn suswintr
Stores a short word of data,
.Pa s ,
to the user-space address
.Pa base .
This function is safe to call during an interrupt context.
.It Fn suword
Stores a word of data,
.Pa l ,
to the user-space address
.Pa base .
.El
.Sh NOTE
The
.Nm
routines are deprecated.
All new code should use
.Fn copyout .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Nm
functions return 0 on success or -1 on failure.

.Xr fetch 9

@- remove all trailing whitespace
     * except when it is escaped with a `\' at the end of the line
- fix remaining .Nm usage as well
- this is from a patch I received from kwesterback@@home.com, who has been
  working on some scripts for fixing formatting errors in mdoc'd man pages

Ok, so there could be a cost/benefit debate with this commit, but since I have
the patch we might as well commit it...
