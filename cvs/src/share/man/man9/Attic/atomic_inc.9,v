@rename the atomic_foo manpages to atomic_foo_int or _uint cos we name these
after functions. for reasons.

.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm atomic_inc_int ,
.Nm atomic_inc_int_nv ,
.Nm atomic_inc_long ,
.Nm atomic_inc_long_nv
.Nd atomic increment operations
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/atomic.h
.Ft void
.Fn atomic_inc_int "volatile unsigned int *p"
.Ft unsigned int
.Fn atomic_inc_int_nv "volatile unsigned int *p"
.Ft void
.Fn atomic_inc_long "volatile unsigned long *p "
.Ft unsigned long
.Fn atomic_inc_long_nv "volatile unsigned long *p"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm atomic_inc
set of functions provide an interface for atomically performing
increment and increment-and-fetch operations
with respect to interrupts and multiple processors in the system.
.Pp
The value referenced by the pointer
.Fa p
is incremented by 1.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Nm atomic_inc_int
and
.Nm atomic_inc_long
perform the increment without returning any knowledge of the value at the
.Fa p .
.Pp
.Nm atomic_inc_int_nv
and
.Nm atomic_inc_long_nv
return the value at
.Fa p
after the increment was performed.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr atomic 9 ,
.Xr atomic_add 9 ,
.Xr atomic_dec 9
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm atomic_add
functions first appeared in
.Ox 5.5 .

1.1
log
@add an MI api for atomic ops in the kernel. this api has its origins in
solaris, but we found it via netbsd.

this provides an MI implementation by using gccs atomic builtins. if an
arch wants to provide a better implementation it can simply provide the
specific bit of the api it wants to replace as a macro.

we're being conservative with this API and only providing it in the
kernel, and only for uints, ulongs, and pointers.

discussed at n2k14 and with hackers at length.
