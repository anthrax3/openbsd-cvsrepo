.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm mi_switch ,
.Nm cpu_switchto
.Nd switch to another process context
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <sys/param.h>
.Fd #include <sys/proc.h>
.Ft void
.Fn mi_switch "void"
.Ft void
.Fn cpu_switchto "struct proc *old" "struct proc *new"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn mi_switch
function implements the machine-independent prelude to a process context
switch.
It is called from only a few distinguished places in the kernel code as a
result of the principle of non-preemptable kernel mode execution.
The three major uses of
.Fn mi_switch
can be enumerated as follows:
.Bl -enum -offset indent
.It
From within
.Xr tsleep 9
when the current process
voluntarily relinquishes the CPU to wait for some resource to become
available.
.It
After handling a trap
.Pq e.g., a system call or device interrupt
when the kernel prepares a return to user-mode execution.
This case is typically handled by machine-dependent trap-handling code after
detection of a change in the signal disposition of the current process, or
when a higher priority process might be available to run.
The latter event is communicated by the machine-independent scheduling
routines by calling the machine-dependent
.Fn need_resched "void" .
.It
In the signal handling code
.Pq see Xr issignal 9
if a signal is delivered that causes a process to stop.
.El
.Pp
.Fn mi_switch
records the amount of time the current process has been running in the
process structure and checks this value against the CPU time limits
allocated to the process
.Pq see Xr getrlimit 2 .
Exceeding the soft limit results in a
.Dv SIGXCPU
signal to be posted to the process, while exceeding the hard limit will
cause a
.Dv SIGKILL .
For a process which accumulated longer than 10 minutes of
CPU time, its nice level is raised to 4.
After these administrative tasks are done,
.Fn mi_switch
chooses the next process to run and hands over control to the machine
dependent routine
.Fn cpu_switchto ,
which will perform the actual process context switch.
.Pp
.Fn cpu_switchto
will save the context of the old process and switch to the new one.
A special case is when the old process is
.Dv NULL
which means that the old process has exited and doesn't need to be
saved.
.Pp
Note that
.Fn mi_switch
and thus
.Fn cpu_switchto
should be called at
.Xr splhigh 9 .
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr spl 9 ,

@sleep(9) was removed aeons ago according to miod, so remove references
to it.  Because man pages are named after functions (at least they
should be) and sleep(9) doesn't exist anymore, sleep.9 is renamed to
tsleep.9.

Input and reminders from jmc and ratchov.

.Fn cpu_switch
will make a choice amongst the processes which are ready to run from a
priority queue data-structure.
The priority queue consists of an array
.Va qs[NQS]
of queue header structures each of which identifies a list of runnable
processes of equal priority
.Pq see Aq Pa sys/proc.h .
A single word
.Va whichqs
containing a bit mask identifying non-empty queues assists in selecting
a process quickly.
.Fn cpu_switch
must remove the first process from the list on the queue
with the highest priority
(lower indices in
.Va qs
indicate higher priority),
and assign the address of its process structure to the global variable
.Va curproc .
If no processes are available on the run queues,
.Fn cpu_switch
shall go into an
.Dq idle
loop.
The idle loop must allow interrupts to be taken that will eventually cause
processes to appear again on the run queues.
The variable
.Va curproc
should be
d108 2
a109 3
while
.Fn cpu_switch
waits for this to happen.

If those pages are different from the NetBSD version, maybe there's a
reason ?

Like, possibly, I just read our source code, which just happens to do
things in DIFFERENT ways than NetBSD does ?

As far as the added pages go, they obviously haven't been checked against
actual code as well, hence they're worse than useless, since a large part
of the information is definitely misleading.
