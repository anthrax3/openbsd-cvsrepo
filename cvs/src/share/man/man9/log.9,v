.Sh NAME
.Nm log ,
.Nm addlog
.Nd log a message from the kernel through the /dev/klog device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/syslog.h
.Ft void
.Fo log
.Fa "int level"
.Fa "const char *format"
.Fa "..."
.Fc
.Ft void
.Fn addlog "const char *format" ...

Usually
.Xr syslogd 8
monitors
.Pa /dev/klog
for these messages and writes them to a log file.
.Pp
All messages are formatted using
.Xr printf 9 ,
logged using facility
.Dv LOG_KERN ,
and priority level
.Fa level .
.Pp
The
.Fn addlog
function is used to build a log message in steps, by adding information
to an initial call to
.Fn log .

@First pass at removing clauses 3 and 4 from NetBSD licenses.

Not sure what's more surprising: how long it took for NetBSD to
catch up to the rest of the BSDs (including UCB), or the amount of
code that NetBSD has claimed for itself without attributing to the
actual authors.

If those pages are different from the NetBSD version, maybe there's a
reason ?

Like, possibly, I just read our source code, which just happens to do
things in DIFFERENT ways than NetBSD does ?

As far as the added pages go, they obviously haven't been checked against
actual code as well, hence they're worse than useless, since a large part
of the information is definitely misleading.
