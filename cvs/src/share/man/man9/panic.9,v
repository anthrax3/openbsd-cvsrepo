.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/types.h
.In sys/systm.h
.Ft void
.Fn panic "const char *fmt" ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn panic

style format string.
The message is printed to the console and the location
pointed to by the global char pointer
.Fa panicstr
is set to the address of the message text for retrieval from the OS
core dump.

If the kernel debugger is installed, control is passed to it.
Otherwise, an attempt is made to save a core dump of the OS to a configured
dump device.
.Pp
If
.Fn panic
is called twice (from the disk sync routines, for example) the system is
rebooted without syncing the disks.

The

@- remove all trailing whitespace
     * except when it is escaped with a `\' at the end of the line
- fix remaining .Nm usage as well
- this is from a patch I received from kwesterback@@home.com, who has been
  working on some scripts for fixing formatting errors in mdoc'd man pages

Ok, so there could be a cost/benefit debate with this commit, but since I have
the patch we might as well commit it...
