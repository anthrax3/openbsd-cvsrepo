.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/types.h
.In sys/socket.h
.In net/if.h
.In net/route.h
.Ft int
.Fn rt_ifa_add "struct ifaddr *ifa" "int flags" "struct sockaddr *dst"
.Ft int
.Fn rt_ifa_del "struct ifaddr *ifa" "int flags" "struct sockaddr *dst"
.Ft int
.Fn rt_ifa_addlocal "struct ifaddr *ifa"
.Ft int
.Fn rt_ifa_dellocal "struct ifaddr *ifa"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
These functions create and delete routing entries required by the network
stack and managed by the kernel.
.Bl -tag -width rt_ifa_addlocalxx
.It Fn rt_ifa_add
Creates and associates a connected routing entry with
.Fa ifa .
.Pp
Connected routing entries represent routes to prefixes and should be created
with
.Dv RTF_CLONING
in
.Fa flags
and the address of
.Fa ifa
in
.Fa dst .
But for Point-to-Point interfaces, connected routing entries represent routes
to hosts and should be created
with
.Dv RTF_HOST
in
.Fa flags
and the destination address in
.Fa dst .
Connected routing entries have a priority of
.Dv RTP_CONNECTED .
.It Fn rt_ifa_del
Removes the connected routing entry associated with
.Fa ifa .
.It Fn rt_ifa_addlocal
Creates and associates a local routing entry
with
.Fa ifa .
.Pp
Local routing entries are used to not send packets destined to a local
address on the wire and instead redirect them to
.Xr lo 4 .
They have the lowest priority available,
.Dv RTP_LOCAL ,
and contain a special flag,
.Dv RTF_LOCAL ,
that can be checked to determine if the address is configured on the system.
.It Fn rt_ifa_dellocal
Removes the local routing entry associated with
.Fa ifa .
.El
.Sh CONTEXT
.Fn rt_ifa_add ,
.Fn rt_ifa_del ,
.Fn rt_ifa_addlocal ,
and
.Fn rt_ifa_dellocal
can be called during autoconf, from process context, or from interrupt context.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn rt_ifa_add ,
.Fn rt_ifa_del ,
.Fn rt_ifa_addlocal ,
and
.Fn rt_ifa_dellocal
will return
.Dv 0
on success and the return value of
.Xr rtrequest 9
otherwise.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr lo 4 ,
.Xr route 4 ,
.Xr rtrequest 9

@Use the terms "routing entry" or simply "entry" when talking about the

log
@Retire rtinit() an use rt_ifa_add(9) and rt_ifa_del(9) to manage
connected routes to prefixes/hosts.

Since the introduction of rt_ifa_addloop(9) and rt_ifa_delloop(9),
rtinit() was just a wrapper, so use the underlying functions
directly and document them.
