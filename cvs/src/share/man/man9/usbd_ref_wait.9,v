.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In dev/usb/usb.h
.In dev/usb/usbdi.h
.Ft void
.Fn usbd_ref_incr "struct usbd_device *dev"
.Ft void
.Fn usbd_ref_decr "struct usbd_device *dev"
.Ft void
.Fn usbd_ref_wait "struct usbd_device *dev"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn usbd_ref_wait
function is used on a device level to
.Xr tsleep 9
until the reference counter has reached zero.
.Pp
To increase the reference counter use
.Fn usbd_ref_incr .
To decrease the reference counter use
.Fn usbd_ref_decr .
Once the reference counter has been decreased to zero,
.Fn usbd_ref_decr
will call
.Fn wakeup
to interrupt the
.Fn tsleep
at the point where
.Fn usbd_ref_wait
was previously set.
.Pp
Typical use cases to wait for tasks to complete is at device closing
or detachment.
.Sh CONTEXT
.Fn usbd_ref_incr ,
.Fn usbd_ref_decr ,
and
.Fn usbd_ref_wait
can be called during autoconf or from process context.
