.Sh DESCRIPTION
The kernel socket
programming interface permits in-kernel consumers to interact with
local and network socket objects in a manner similar to that permitted using
the
.Xr socket 2
user API.
These interfaces are appropriate for use by distributed file systems and
other network-aware kernel services.
While the user API operates on file descriptors, the kernel interfaces
operate directly on
.Vt "struct socket"
pointers.
.Pp
Except where otherwise indicated,
.Nm
functions may sleep.
.Ss Creating and Destroying Sockets
A new socket may be created using
.Fn socreate .
As with
.Xr socket 2 ,
arguments specify the requested domain, type, and protocol via
.Fa dom , type ,
and
.Fa proto .
The socket is returned via
.Fa aso
on success.
.Em Warning :
authorization of the socket creation operation will be performed
using
.Dv curproc
for some protocols (such as raw sockets).
.Pp
Sockets may be closed and freed using
.Fn soclose ,
which has similar semantics to
.Xr close 2 .
.Ss Connections and Addresses
The
.Fn sobind
function is equivalent to the
.Xr bind 2
system call, and binds the socket
.Fa so
to the address
.Fa nam .
The operation would be authorized using the credential on process
.Fa p .
.Pp
The
.Fn soconnect
function is equivalent to the
.Xr connect 2
system call, and initiates a connection on the socket
.Fa so
to the address
.Fa nam .
The operation will be authorized using the credential on
.Dv curproc .
Unlike the user system call,
.Fn soconnect
returns immediately; the caller may
.Xr tsleep 9
on
.Fa so->so_timeo
and wait for the
.Dv SS_ISCONNECTING
flag to clear or
.Fa so->so_error
to become non-zero.
If
.Fn soconnect
fails, the caller must manually clear the
.Dv SS_ISCONNECTING
flag.
.Pp
The
.Fn soshutdown
function is equivalent to the
.Xr shutdown 2
system call, and causes part or all of a connection on a socket to be closed
down.
.Ss Socket Options
The
.Fn sogetopt
function is equivalent to the
.Xr getsockopt 2
system call, and retrieves a socket option on socket
.Fa so .
The
.Fn sosetopt
function is equivalent to the
.Xr setsockopt 2
system call, and sets a socket option on socket
.Fa so .
.Pp
The next two arguments in both
.Fn sogetopt
and
.Fn sosetopt
are
.Fa level
and
.Fa optname
describing the protocol level and socket option.
The last argument is either a pointer to a prefilled mbuf
.Fa m0
or a pointer to a mbuf pointer
.Fa mp
which will point to the retrieved data.
.Ss Socket I/O
The
.Fn soreceive
function is equivalent to the
.Xr recvmsg 2
system call, and attempts to receive bytes of data from the socket
.Fa so ,
optionally blocking and awaiting data if none is ready to read.
Data may be retrieved directly to kernel or user memory via the
.Fa uio
argument, or as an mbuf chain returned to the caller via
.Fa mp0 ,
avoiding a data copy.
If
.Fa mp0
is not
.Dv NULL ,
.Fa uio
must still be passed with uio_resid set to specify the maximum
amount of data to be returned to the caller via an mbuf chain.
The caller may optionally retrieve a socket address on a protocol with the
.Dv PR_ADDR
capability by providing storage via a
.Pf non- Dv NULL
.Fa paddr
argument.
The caller may optionally retrieve up to
.Fa controllen
bytes of control data in mbufs via a
.Pf non- Dv NULL
.Fa controlp
argument.
Optional flags may be passed to
.Fn soreceive
via a
.Pf non- Dv NULL
.Fa flagsp
argument, and use the same flag name space as the
.Xr recvmsg 2
system call.
.Pp
When the
.Fn so_upcall
function pointer is not
.Dv NULL ,
it is called when
.Fn soreceive
matches an incoming connection.
.Pp
The
.Fn sosend
function is equivalent to the
.Xr sendmsg 2
system call, and attempts to send bytes of data via the socket
.Fa so ,
optionally blocking if data cannot be immediately sent.
Data may be sent directly from kernel or user memory via the
.Fa uio
argument, or as an mbuf chain via
.Fa top ,
avoiding a data copy.
Only one of the
.Fa uio
or
.Fa top
pointers may be
.Pf non- Dv NULL .
An optional destination address may be specified via a
.Pf non- Dv NULL
.Fa addr
argument, which may result in an implicit connect if supported by the
protocol.
The caller may optionally send control data mbufs via a
.Pf non- Dv NULL
.Fa control
argument.
Flags may be passed to
.Fn sosend
using the
.Fa flags
argument, and use the same flag name space as the
.Xr sendmsg 2
system call.
.Pp
Kernel callers running in interrupt context, or with a mutex held, will wish to
use non-blocking sockets and pass the
.Dv MSG_DONTWAIT
flag in order to prevent these functions from sleeping.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Xr socket 2
system call appeared in
.Bx 4.2 .
This manual page was introduced in
.Fx 7.0
and ported to
.Ox 4.5 .
.Sh AUTHORS
This manual page was written by
.An Robert Watson .
.Sh BUGS
The use of credentials hung from explicitly passed processes,
and the credential on
.Dv curproc ,
and the cached credential from socket creation time is inconsistent, and may
lead to unexpected behaviour.
.Pp
The caller may need to manually clear
.Dv SS_ISCONNECTING
if
.Fn soconnect
returns an error.
.Pp
The
.Dv MSG_DONTWAIT
flag is not implemented for
.Fn sosend .
.Pp
This manual page does not describe how to register socket upcalls or monitor
a socket for readability/writability without using blocking I/O.

@you must pass uio to socreate, even if you want an mbuf back.

the uio specifies how much data may be returned in the mbuf.

this should make teary students less sad, but probably not cos
theyve already had to hand the assignment in.
