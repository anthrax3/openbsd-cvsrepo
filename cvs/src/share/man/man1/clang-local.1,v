.Sh NAME
.Nm clang-local
.Nd OpenBSD-specific behavior of LLVM/clang
.Sh DESCRIPTION
On
.Ox ,
the LLVM/clang compiler exhibits the following characteristics:
.Bl -dash
.It
.Nm clang
comes with stack protection enabled by default, equivalent to the
.Fl fstack-protector-strong
option on other systems.
The system will report any violation of the stack protector cookie along
with the function name via
.Xr syslog 3
at
.Dv LOG_CRIT
priority.
.It
.Nm clang
will generate PIE code by default, allowing the system to load the resulting
binary at a random location.
This behavior can be turned off by passing
.Fl fno-pie
to the compiler and
.Fl nopie
to the linker.
.It
The
.Fl fstrict-aliasing
option is turned off by default unless
.Fl Ofast
has been selected.
.It
The
.Fl pg
flag is an alias of
.Fl p .
.It
.Nm clang
does not warn for passing pointer arguments or assignment with
different signedness outside of
.Fl pedantic .
This can be
re-enabled with the
.Fl Wpointer-sign
flag.
.It
Color diagnostic messages are disabled by default and can be re-enabled with
.Fl fdiagnostics-color .

@Add a clang-local(1) man page, similar to gcc-local(1).  This documents
OpenBSD-specific quirks for LLVM/clang.  To be expanded as we go along.
