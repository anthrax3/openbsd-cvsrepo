@providing MLINKS for shell builtins makes little sense: what we had was out
of date for ever (no ksh builtins), and since we have two shells, pointing
to one page or the other is never going to work; so remove MLINKS for
csh(1); the cd(1) and wait(1) pages (also builtins); and update any trailing
Xr's;

please, there are tools like whence, man, and locate for finding this stuff;

ok deraadt miod

.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm wait
.Nd await process completion
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm wait
.Op Ar pid
.Sh DESCRIPTION
If invoked with no arguments, the
.Nm
utility waits until all existing child processes in the background
have terminated.
.Pp
Available operands:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ar pid
If a
.Ar pid
operand is specified, and it is the process ID of a
background child process that still exists, the
.Nm
utility waits until that process has completed and consumes its status
information, without consuming the status information of any other process.
.Pp
If a
.Ar pid
operand is specified that is not the process ID of
a child background process that still exists,
.Nm
exits without waiting for any processes to complete.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility exits with one of the following values:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It \&0
The
.Nm
utility was invoked with no operands and all of the existing background
child processes have terminated, or the process specified by the
.Ar pid
operand exited normally with 0 as its exit status.
.It \&>\&0
The specified process did not exist and its exit status information was not
available, or its exit status information was available and it terminated with
a non-zero exit status.
.El
.Pp
If the specified process terminated abnormally due to the receipt of a signal,
the exit status information of
.Nm
contains that termination status as well.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr wait 2
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Nm
command is expected to be
.St -p1003.2
compatible.
