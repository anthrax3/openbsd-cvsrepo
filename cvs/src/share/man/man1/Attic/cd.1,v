@providing MLINKS for shell builtins makes little sense: what we had was out
of date for ever (no ksh builtins), and since we have two shells, pointing
to one page or the other is never going to work; so remove MLINKS for
csh(1); the cd(1) and wait(1) pages (also builtins); and update any trailing
Xr's;

please, there are tools like whence, man, and locate for finding this stuff;

ok deraadt miod

.Sh NAME
.Nm cd
.Nd change working directory
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm cd
.Op Ar directory
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Ar directory
is an absolute or relative pathname which becomes the new working directory.
The interpretation of a relative pathname by
.Nm
depends on the
.Ev CDPATH
environment variable (see below).
For an explanation of the directory hierarchy,
see
.Xr hier 7 .
.Pp
Note that
.Nm
is implemented as a built-in shell command and not as a stand-alone program.
Because each process has its own working directory, a separate
.Nm
utility would have no effect (it would change the directory and exit,
leaving the working directory in the parent unchanged).
Different shells may implement
.Nm
with features different from those described here.
Please consult the manual for your specific shell.
.Pp
The
.Nm
command exits 0 on success or >0 if an error occurred.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
The following environment variables affect the execution of
.Nm cd :
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Ev CDPATH
If the
.Ar directory
operand does not begin with a slash
.Pq Sq /
character, and the first component is not dot
.Pq Ql \&.
or dot-dot
.Pq Ql .. ,
.Nm
searches for the directory relative to each colon-separated directory named
in the
.Ev CDPATH
variable, in the order listed.
The new working directory is set to the first matching directory found.
An empty string in place of a directory pathname represents the current
directory.
If the new working directory was derived from
.Ev CDPATH ,
it will be printed to the standard output.
See
.Xr sh 1
for details.
Users of
.Xr csh 1
use the variable
.Ev cdpath
instead.
.It Ev HOME
If
.Nm
is invoked without arguments and the
.Ev HOME
environment variable exists and contains a directory name, that directory
becomes the new working directory.
.El
.Pp
See
.Xr environ 7
for more information on environment variables.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr csh 1 ,
.Xr pwd 1 ,
.Xr sh 1 ,
.Xr chdir 2 ,
.Xr environ 7 ,
.Xr hier 7
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Nm
command is expected to be
.St -p1003.2
compatible.
