@Section 1, not section one: section numbers are always numerical.
For example, "man -s one" wouldn't work either.

.Sh NAME
.Nm intro
.Nd introduction to general commands (tools and utilities)
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The manual pages in section 1 contain most of the commands which comprise the
.Bx
user environment.
Some of the commands included in section 1 are
text editors,
command shell interpreters,
searching and sorting tools,
file manipulation commands,
system status commands,
remote file copy commands,
mail commands,
compilers and compiler tools,
formatted output tools,
and line printer commands.
.Pp
All commands set a status value upon exit which may be tested
to see if the command completed normally.
The exit values and their meanings are explained in the individual manuals.
Traditionally, the value 0 signifies successful completion of the command.
