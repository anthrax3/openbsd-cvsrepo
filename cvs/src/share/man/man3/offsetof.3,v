.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In stddef.h
.Ft size_t
.Fn offsetof "type" "member"

and yields the offset,
in bytes, of the field
.Ar member
from the start of the structure
.Ar type .

A compiler error will result if
.Ar member
is not aligned to a byte boundary (i.e. it is a bit-field).
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn offsetof
macro conforms to
.St -ansiC .
