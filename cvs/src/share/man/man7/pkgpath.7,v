.Sh NAME
.Nm pkgpath
.Nd ports tree location for a package build
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Each location in the ports tree is uniquely identified through a
.Nm ,
which encodes the directory, flavor and subpackage information
that allows the build of a package.
This is not to be confused with
.Ev PKG_PATH ,
the list of URLs from which
.Xr pkg_add 1
retrieves binary packages.
.Pp
Every
.Nm
conforms to the pattern
.Ar some/directory[,-sub][,flavor...] .
.Pp
The
.Ar some/directory
part refers to the directory part, to find under the
portstree, usually in
.Pa /usr/ports
(or
.Pa /usr/ports/mystuff
for port developers).
.Pp
The
.Ar ,-sub
optional part refers to a specific subpackage from a
multi-package port.
It can be left blank for non multi-package ports, or to get
the default subpackage
(usually
.Ar -main ) .
.Pp
The
.Ar ,flavor...
optional part refers to the flavors or pseudo-flavors to use
when building the package.
If left blank, it refers to the default flavor.
An explicit empty flavor can also be specified to make sure to
get an empty flavor, even if it does not correspond to the default
flavor.
.Pp
Note that
.Ar -sub
and
.Ar flavor
parts can be specified in any order, as all subpackages start with
a dash.
It is an error to ask for several subs at once, e.g.\&
.Ar some/path,-sub1,-sub2 ,
though it won't always be flagged as a problem.
.Pp
For instance:
.Bl -tag -width small
.It Ar misc/screen
A simple directory, default flavor, which happens to be empty.
.It Ar misc/screen,static
Same port,
.Ar static
flavor.
.It Ar x11/kde/libs3
A multi-package port with no subpackage nor flavor, refers to
.Ar x11/kde/libs3,-main .
.It Ar net/avahi
Multi-package port with default flavor.
Will actually build with FLAVOR="no_gui no_mono no_qt3 no_qt4 bootstrap"
(all of which are pseudo-flavors), so that only the main package will build.
.It Ar net/avahi,no_mono,-qt3
Build avahi with the "no_mono" pseudo-flavor, which will build the
-main, -qt3, -qt4, -gui, -gtk, -gtk3, and -ui subpackages, and refer to the
.Ar -qt3
subpackage.
.It Ar net/avahi,
.Ar net/avahi
with an explicit empty flavor, default subpackage
.Po
which happens to be
.Ar -main
.Pc .
.It Ar net/avahi,,-qt4
.Ar net/avahi
with an explicit empty flavor,
.Ar -qt4
subpackage.
.El
.Pp
The ports tree can iterate over lists of
.Nm
through
.Li SUBDIR="pkgpath1 pkgpath2..."
or through a full list through
.Li SUBDIRLIST=file .
.Pp
.Xr dpb 1
also handles
.Nm
lists for many options.
.Sh NORMALISATION AND THE FULLPATH CONVENTION
When the ports tree handles dependencies, it passes
.Nm
from
.Ev BUILD_DEPENDS ,
.Ev LIB_DEPENDS ,
.Ev RUN_DEPENDS ,
and
.Ev TEST_DEPENDS
to the dependent port for normalisation purposes.
That way, the
.Nm
that gets recorded in the package doesn't have any "default" flavor
or "default" subpackage left: those are always resolved to the correct
value.
.Pp
Likewise, pseudo-flavors vanish from the
.Nm pkgpath ,
since they only participate in the build process, but do not intervene
in the built package.
.Pp
As a result, such
.Nm
are slightly different from the description above, as a flavor left blank
is the empty flavor (and not the default flavor).
This is the
.Qq fullpath convention .
.Pp
Tools such as
.Xr dpb 1
display fullpath pkgpaths,
and binary packages store full pkgpaths.
.Pp
.Ev SUBDIR
and
.Ev SUBDIRLIST
can be forced to follow the fullpath convention by explicitly passing
.Li FULLPATH=Yes
to the corresponding
.Xr make 1
invocations.
.Pp
Most tools that process binary packages do so.
