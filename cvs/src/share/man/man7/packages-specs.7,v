.Dt PACKAGES-SPECS 7
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm packages-specs
.Nd binary package names specifications
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Each package has a name consisting of at most three parts:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
stem-version[-flavors]
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Ar stem
part identifies the package.
It may contain some dashes, but its form is mostly conventional.
For instance, japanese packages usually
start with a
.Sq ja
prefix, e.g.,
.Qq ja-kterm-6.2.0 .
.Pp
The
.Ar version
part starts at the first digit that follows a
.Sq - ,
and goes on up to the following
.Sq - ,
or to the end of the package name, whichever comes first.
.Pp
It is followed by the (possibly empty)
.Op - Ns Ar flavors
part.
.Pp
Thus, version numbers should always start with a digit and cannot contain
a
.Sq - ,
whereas flavors should never start with a digit.
.Pp
All packages must have a version number.
Normally, the version number directly matches the original software
distribution version number, or release date.
In case there are substantial changes in the
.Ox
package, a patch level marker should be appended, e.g.,
.Sq p0 ,
.Sq p1 ...
For example, assuming that the screen package for release 2.8 was
named
.Qq screen-2.9.8
and that an important security patch led to a newer package,
the new package would be called
.Qq screen-2.9.8p0 .
Obviously, these specific markers are reserved for
.Ox
purposes.
See
.Ev REVISION
in
.Xr bsd.port.mk 5 .
.Pp
Version comparison is done using the dewey notation with a few specific rules.
.Bl -bullet
.It
The version number is cut into separate parts on each dot
.Sq \&. .
Therefore, replace other upstream separators such as
.Sq _
or
.Sq -
with dots.
.It
Comparison checks each part in turn, the first part that differs yields
a comparison result.
.It
If parts are numbers they are compared numerically.
.It
Parts can also be numbers with an optional letter appended.
The numbers are compared numerically, and in case of equality, the letter
makes the difference.
.It
Other parts are compared alphabetically.
.It
The last part may contain an extra suffix matching
.Ar rc[N] ,
.Ar beta[N] ,
.Ar pre[N] ,
or
.Ar pl[N] ,
with
.Ar N
an optional number.
These correspond to traditional notations for
.Sq release candidate ,
.Sq beta version ,
.Sq pre-release ,
.Sq patch-level ,
and are ordered accordingly, e.g.,
.Ar beta
is oldest,
.Ar rc
and
.Ar pre
are next (and non-comparable to one another),
then normal version, and finally
.Ar pl .
.Bl -dash
.It
"foo-1.01" is equal to "foo-1.1", which can lead to surprises..
.It
"foo-1.001" is older than "foo-1.002", which in turns is older than "foo-1.0010"
.It
"foo-1.0rc2" is not comparable to "foo-1.0pre3"
.It
"bar-1.0beta3" is older than "bar-1.0rc1"
.It
"baz-1.0" is older than "baz-1.0pl1"
.El
.El
.Pp
In some rare cases, version numbering changes completely upstream.
A version style marker, of the form
.Sq v0 ,
.Sq v1 ...
can be appended to the version number (after the patch level)
to denote the new numbering scheme.
See
.Ev EPOCH
in
.Xr bsd.port.mk 5 .
.Pp
Flavored packages will also contain a list of flavors after the version
identifier, in a canonical order determined by
.Ev FLAVORS
in the corresponding port's
.Pa Makefile .
For instance, kterm has an xaw3d flavor:
.Qq ja-kterm-xaw3d .
.Pp
Note that, to uniquely identify the version part, no flavor shall ever
start with a digit.
Usually, flavored packages are slightly different versions of the same
package that offer very similar functionalities.
.Sh CONFLICTS
Most conflicts between packages are handled on a package name basis.
Unless the packages have been specially prepared, it is
normally not possible to install two packages with the same
.Ar stem .
.Pp
Note that the
.Ar stem
ends at the
.Ar version
part.
So, for instance,
.Qq kdelibs-1.1.2
and
.Qq kdelibs-2.1.1
conflict.
But
.Qq openldap-2.0.7
and
.Qq openldap-client-2.0.7
don't.
Neither do
.Qq qt-1.45
and
.Qq qt2-3.0 .
.Sh DEPENDENCIES
Packages may depend on other packages, as specified by their port's
Makefile, in a
.Ev BUILD_DEPENDS ,
.Ev LIB_DEPENDS ,
.Ev TEST_DEPENDS
or
.Ev RUN_DEPENDS .
All those conform to
.Bd -literal -offset indent
[pkgspec:]pkgpath
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Xr pkgpath 7
part of the dependency is always used to obtain the default dependency for
the given package (the package that will be built and installed if no package
is found).
The corresponding package name is also used as a package specification,
after removing any version and flavor requirements.
.Pp
Without a
.Sq pkgspec:
part, by default, any package with the right stem will do: in effect,
the pkgspec used is
.Sq stem-* .
.Pp
In
.Ox 4.9 ,
the dependent port may override this default, and set
.Ev PKGSPEC
to achieve a more restrictive default, for instance,
.Pa databases/db/v3
sets the default to
.Qq PKGSPEC = db->=3,<4
to avoid collision with
.Pa databases/db/v4 .
Be extra cautious with this functionality: this tweaks the depends line for
any including package, thus usually requiring a version bump, and is in
general only required for very messy cases where several incompatible versions
of the same software coexist as packages with the same stem.
.Pp
An explicit specification such as
.Qq png-1.0.7 .
may be used to ask for a more specific version number.
Version numbers may also include ranges, separated by commas, so for
instance,
.Qq foo->=1.3
would match any foo with version at least 1.3, and
.Qq foo->=1.3,<=1.5
would match any version of foo between 1.3 and 1.5, inclusive.
.Pp
As a convenience, the ports tree recognizes a specification that starts
with STEM, and will replace this with the correct stem, which can be useful
for embarrassingly long package names.
.Pp
As another convenience, the ports tree recognizes constructs like
.Qq graphics/png>=1.2.0
and transforms it into
.Qq STEM->=1.2.0:graphics/png .
More specifically, package paths never contain <, >, or =, and those
characters trigger the transform.
.Pp
If the flavor specification is left blank, any flavor will do.
Note that most default package names don't contain flavor specification,
which means that any flavor will do
For instance, in
.Bd -literal -offset indent
LIB_DEPENDS = graphics/aalib
.Ed
.Pp
both
.Qq aalib-1.2
and
.Qq aalib-1.2-no_x11
will do.
To restrict the specification to packages that match flavor
.Sq f ,
append
.Sq -f .
To restrict the specification to packages that do not match flavor
.Sq f ,
append
.Sq -!f .
In the preceding case, one may use
.Bd -literal -offset indent
LIB_DEPENDS = aalib-*-!no_x11:graphics/aalib
.Ed
.Pp
to ensure the no_x11 flavor is not picked.
.Sh DEPENDENCIES RESOLUTION
Several packages may be specified for a dependency:
.Qq foo-*|bar-*
will match either any version of package foo, or any version of package bar.
In the general case, each package holds a tree of dependencies.
Resolution occurs at
.Xr pkg_add 1
time, and all dependencies are tracked only as far as needed.
.Pp
For instance, if package
.Qq foo-1.0
depends on either
.Qq bar-*
or
.Qq fuzz-* ,
and
.Qq bar-2.0
depends
on
.Qq toughluck-* ,
.Xr pkg_add 1
will first check whether
.Qq bar-*
or
.Qq fuzz-*
is installed.
If either is there, the
.Qq toughluck-*
dependency will never be examined.
It would only be used in the case where neither
.Qq bar-*
nor
.Qq fuzz-*
are present, thus
.Xr pkg_add 1
would decide to bring in
.Qq bar-2.0 ,
and so would check on
.Qq toughluck-* .
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr pkg_add 1 ,
.Xr bsd.port.mk 5 ,
.Xr library-specs 7 ,
.Xr packages 7 ,
.Xr pkgpath 7 ,
.Xr ports 7
.Sh HISTORY
Support for a more complex form of those package specifications first
appeared in
.Ox 2.9 .
The current simplified form was introduced in
.Ox 4.9 .

@make the version number stuff mandatory.

Restrict specifications to the parts that actually make sense (in particular,
remove most wildcard support, it's no longer a good idea in true
version number handling), explain about v*, and be more specific about
default package specs (since the fuzzyness in the original description
predates several changes to bsd.port.mk).

Also add version numbers and wildcards where they make sense so the examples
are more complete.
