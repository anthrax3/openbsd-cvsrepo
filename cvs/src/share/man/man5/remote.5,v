.Nd remote host description file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
file describes remote hosts known by
.Xr cu 1 .
It is an ASCII file structured somewhat like the
.Xr termcap 5
file.
Each line in the file provides a description for a single remote host.
Fields are separated by a colon
.Pq Sq \&: .
Lines ending with a
.Sq \e
character immediately followed by a newline are continued on the next line.
.Pp
The first entry is the name(s) of the host system.
If there is more than one name for a system, the names are separated by
vertical bars
.Pq Sq \&| .
After the name of the system comes the fields of the description (the
capabilities).
.Pp
Capabilities are either strings (str), numbers (num), or boolean flags (bool).
A string capability is specified by
.Em capability Ns Ar = Ns Em value ;
for example,
.Sq dv=/dev/harris .
A numeric capability is specified by
.Em capability Ns Ar # Ns Em value ;
for example,
.Sq br#19200 .
A boolean capability is specified by simply listing the capability.
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Sy \&br
(num)
The baud rate used in establishing
a connection to the remote host.
This is a decimal number.
The default baud rate is 9600 baud.
.It Sy \&dv
(str)
Device to open to establish a connection.
If this file refers to a terminal line,
.Xr cu 1
attempts to perform an exclusive open on the device to ensure only
one user at a time has access to the port.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /etc/remote -compact
.It Pa /etc/remote

and their attributes are stored in an

After the name of the system comes the fields of the description.
A field name followed by an equal sign
.Pq Sq =
indicates a string value follows.
A field name followed by a pound sign
.Pq Sq #
indicates a following numeric value.

Entries named
.Dq tip\&*
.\"and
.\".Dq cu\&*
are used as default entries by
.Xr tip 1
.\"and the
.\".Xr cu 1
.\"interface to
.\".Xr tip 1 ,
as follows.
When
.Xr tip 1
is invoked with only a baud rate, it looks for an entry of the form
.Dq tip Ns Aq baud rate .
E.g.\&
.Ic tip -300
will cause
.Xr tip 1
to look for the system tip300.

@Fixup example files, man pages and phones parsing.

Make '/etc/remote' a working example, with some lengthy comments that
might help people trying to use it.

Remove untruths and beef up documentation for tip(1), remote(5) and
phones(5). In particular remove last reference to the 'cu' tip
interface since we use the 'cu' that comes with uucp, improve
documentation on phone numbers and flesh out documentation on
acu/modems supported. Document PHONES and REMOTE environment
variables.

Cleanup parsing of /etc/phones (so our example can be used) and ignore
lines with empty phone numbers instead of aborting the scan of the
file. This makes /etc/phones parsing consistant with ':pn:' capability
parsing. Don't try to dial empty phone numbers in either case.

@- remove all trailing whitespace

- fix remaining .Nm usage as well
- this is from a patch I received from kwesterback@@home.com, who has been
  working on some scripts for fixing formatting errors in mdoc'd man pages

Ok, so there could be a cost/benefit debate with this commit, but since I have
the patch we might as well commit it...
