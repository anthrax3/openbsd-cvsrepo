.Nm fbtab
.Nd change device protection upon login
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
file contains lines which specify how the permissions and ownership of
various system files should be changed based on the user's login device name.
.Pp
Comments start with a
.Ql #
and extend to the end of the line.
Blank lines or lines with only a comment are ignored.
.Pp
All other lines consist of three fields delimited by whitespace.
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
.It Login Device
The device you have logged in on (e.g.,
.Dq /dev/ttyv0 ) .
.It File Permission
An octal permission number (0600), as used by
.Xr chmod 2 .
.It Other devices
The final field is a colon
.Pq Ql \&:
delimited list of devices (e.g.,
.Dq /dev/console:/dev/fd0a ) .
All device names are absolute paths.
A path that ends in
.Dq /\&*
refers to all directory entries except
.Dq \&.
and
.Dq \&.\&. .
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
file is used by
.Xr login 1
to
.Xr chown 2
the specified files to the user who has performed a login.
Additionally,
.Xr chmod 2
is used to set the devices to the specified permission.
When a user logs out,
.Xr init 8
is responsible for performing the inverse operation, which results in
the files once again belonging to root.

@- remove all trailing whitespace
     * except when it is escaped with a `\' at the end of the line
- fix remaining .Nm usage as well
- this is from a patch I received from kwesterback@@home.com, who has been
  working on some scripts for fixing formatting errors in mdoc'd man pages

Ok, so there could be a cost/benefit debate with this commit, but since I have
the patch we might as well commit it...
