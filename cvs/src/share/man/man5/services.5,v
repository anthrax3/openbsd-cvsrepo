.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
file contains information regarding the known services available in the
.Tn DARPA
Internet.
For each service, a single line should be present with the
following information:
.Bd -unfilled -offset indent
official service name
port number
protocol name
aliases
.Ed
.Pp
Items are separated by any number of blanks and/or tab characters.
The port number and protocol name are considered a single item; a slash
.Pq Ql /
is used to separate the port and protocol (e.g.,
.Dq 512/tcp ) .
.Pp
A hash mark
.Pq Ql #
indicates the beginning of a comment; subsequent characters up to the
end of the line are not interpreted by the routines which search the file.
.Pp
Service names may contain any printable character other than a
field delimiter, newline, or comment character.

.Sh BUGS
A name server should be used instead of a static file.

are limited to

characters (currently 1024).
Longer lines will be ignored.

@- remove all trailing whitespace
     * except when it is escaped with a `\' at the end of the line
- fix remaining .Nm usage as well
- this is from a patch I received from kwesterback@@home.com, who has been
  working on some scripts for fixing formatting errors in mdoc'd man pages

Ok, so there could be a cost/benefit debate with this commit, but since I have
the patch we might as well commit it...
