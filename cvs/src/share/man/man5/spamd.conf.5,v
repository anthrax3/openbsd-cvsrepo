@man pages with pseudo synopses which list filenames end up creating
very ugly output in man -k; after some discussion with ingo, we feel
the simplest fix is to remove such SYNOPSIS sections: the info is hardly
helpful at page top, is contained already in FILES, and there are
sufficiently few that just zapping them is simple;

ok schwarze, who also helpfully ran things through a build to check
output;

.Sh NAME
.Nm spamd.conf
.Nd spamd-setup configuration file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
file is read by
.Xr spamd-setup 8
to configure
.Em blacklists
for
.Xr spamd 8 .
Blacklists are lists of addresses of likely spammers.
Mail from these addresses never reaches the actual mail server,
but is instead redirected to
.Xr spamd 8
and tarpitted.
.Pp
.Nm
follows the syntax of configuration databases as documented in
.Xr getcap 3 .
Here is an example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
all:\e
	:nixspam:override:myblack:

nixspam:\e
	:black:\e
	:msg="Your address %A is in the nixspam list\en\e
	See http://www.heise.de/ix/nixspam/dnsbl_en/ for details":\e
	:method=http:\e
	:file=www.openbsd.org/spamd/nixspam.gz

override:\e
	:white:\e
	:method=file:\e
	:file=/etc/mail/override.txt:

myblack:\e
	:black:\e
	:msg=/etc/mail/myblackmsg.txt:\e
	:method=file:\e
	:file=/etc/mail/myblack.txt:
.Ed
.Pp
The default configuration file must include the entry
.Ar all ,
which specifies the order in which lists
are to be applied.
Lists are constructed by name:
blacklists are identified by the capability
.Pf : Ar black : .
If a list is instead given the
.Pf : Ar white :
capability,
addresses in it will not be blacklisted.
The addresses in such a list are removed from the preceding blacklist.
.Pp
In the above example,
if an address was present in all three lists,
blacklists
.Ar nixspam
and
.Ar myblack ,
as well as the exceptions list
.Ar override ,
the address would be removed from list
.Ar nixspam
by the subsequent
.Ar override
list.
However, the address would not be removed from the
.Ar myblack
list.
To remove all the addresses in
.Ar override
from
.Ar myblack ,
the following configuration
would be used instead:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
all:\e
	:nixspam:override:myblack:override:
.Ed
.Pp
The source of the addresses for lists is
specified using the
.Ar method
and
.Ar file
capability entries.
.Pp
.Ar method
specifies the method by which to retrieve a file containing a list of
addresses and may be one of
.Ar http ,
.Ar ftp ,
.Ar file ,
or
.Ar exec .
The
.Ar http ,
.Ar ftp ,
and
.Ar file
methods will make
.Nm
retrieve the file from the location specified by the
.Ar file
capability.
The
.Ar exec
method will make
.Nm
spawn the program with arguments indicated in the
.Ar file
capability for the list, and reads a list of addresses
from the output of the program.
.Pp
The format of the list of addresses is expected to consist of one
network block or address per line (optionally followed by a space and
text that is ignored).
Comment lines beginning with
.Ar #
are ignored.
Network blocks may be specified in any of the formats as in
the following example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# CIDR format
192.168.20.0/24
# A start - end range
192.168.21.0 - 192.168.21.255
# As a single IP address
192.168.23.1
.Ed
.Pp
Each blacklist must include a message, specified in the
.Ar msg
capability as a string.
If the
.Ar msg
string is enclosed in double quotes, the characters in the quoted string
are escaped as specified in
.Xr getcap 3
with the exception that a colon (:) is allowed in the quoted string.
The resulting string is used as the message.
Alternatively, if the
.Ar msg
string is not specified in quotes, it is assumed to be a local filename
from which the message text may be read.
.Pp
The message is configured in
.Xr spamd 8
to be displayed in the SMTP dialogue to any connections that match
addresses in the blacklist.
The sequence \e" in the message will produce a double quote in the output.
The sequence %% will produce a single % in the output,
and the sequence \&%A will be expanded in the message by
.Xr spamd 8
to display the connecting IP address in the output.
