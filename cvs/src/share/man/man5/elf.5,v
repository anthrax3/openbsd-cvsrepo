.Dt ELF 5
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm elf
.Nd format of ELF executable binary files
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In elf_abi.h
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The header file
.In elf_abi.h
defines the format of ELF executable binary files.
Amongst these files are
normal executable files, relocatable object files, core files and shared
libraries.
.Pp
An executable file using the ELF file format consists of an ELF header,
followed by a program header table or a section header table, or both.
The ELF header is always at offset zero of the file.
The program header
table and the section header table's offset in the file are defined in the
ELF header.
The two tables describe the rest of the particularities of
the file.
.Pp
Applications which wish to process ELF binary files for their native
architecture only should include
.In elf_abi.h
in their source code.
These applications should need to refer to
all the types and structures by their generic names
.Dq Elf_xxx
and to the macros by
.Dq ELF_xxx .
Applications written this way can be compiled on any architecture,
regardless of whether the host is 32-bit or 64-bit.
.Pp
Should an application need to process ELF files of an unknown
architecture, then the application needs to explicitly use either
.Dq Elf32_xxx
or
.Dq Elf64_xxx
type and structure names.
Likewise, the macros need to be identified by
.Dq ELF32_xxx
or
.Dq ELF64_xxx .
.Pp
This header file describes the above mentioned headers as C structures
and also includes structures for dynamic sections, relocation sections and
symbol tables.
.Pp
The following types are used for 32-bit architectures:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
Elf32_Addr	Unsigned program address
Elf32_Off	Unsigned file offset
Elf32_Sword	Signed large integer
Elf32_Word	Unsigned large integer
Elf32_Half	Unsigned medium integer
.Ed
.Pp
And the following types are used for 64-bit architectures:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
Elf64_Addr	Unsigned program address
Elf64_Off	Unsigned file offset
Elf64_Shalf	Signed halfword field
Elf64_Sword	Signed large integer
Elf64_Word	Field or unsigned large integer
Elf64_Sxword	Signed object size or alignment
Elf64_Xword	Unsigned object size or alignment
Elf64_Half	Unsigned halfword field
Elf64_Quarter	Unsigned quarterword field
.Ed
.Pp
All data structures that the file format defines follow the
.Dq natural
size and alignment guidelines for the relevant class.
If necessary,
data structures contain explicit padding to ensure 4-byte alignment
for 4-byte objects, to force structure sizes to a multiple of 4, etc.
.Pp
The ELF header is described by the type Elf32_Ehdr or Elf64_Ehdr:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
typedef struct {
        unsigned char   e_ident[EI_NIDENT];
        Elf32_Half      e_type;
        Elf32_Half      e_machine;
        Elf32_Word      e_version;
        Elf32_Addr      e_entry;
        Elf32_Off       e_phoff;
        Elf32_Off       e_shoff;
        Elf32_Word      e_flags;
        Elf32_Half      e_ehsize;
        Elf32_Half      e_phentsize;
        Elf32_Half      e_phnum;
        Elf32_Half      e_shentsize;
        Elf32_Half      e_shnum;
        Elf32_Half      e_shstrndx;
} Elf32_Ehdr;
.Ed
.Bd -literal -offset indent
typedef struct {
	unsigned char   e_ident[EI_NIDENT];
	Elf64_Quarter   e_type;
	Elf64_Quarter   e_machine;
	Elf64_Half      e_version;
	Elf64_Addr      e_entry;
	Elf64_Off       e_phoff;
	Elf64_Off       e_shoff;
	Elf64_Half      e_flags;
	Elf64_Quarter   e_ehsize;
	Elf64_Quarter   e_phentsize;
	Elf64_Quarter   e_phnum;
	Elf64_Quarter   e_shentsize;
	Elf64_Quarter   e_shnum;
	Elf64_Quarter   e_shstrndx;
} Elf64_Ehdr;
.Ed
.Pp

Flag names take the form EF_`machine_flag'.
Currently no flags have been defined.
.It Dv e_ehsize
This member holds the ELF header's size in bytes.
.It Dv e_phentsize
This member holds the size in bytes of one entry in the file's program header
table; all entries are the same size.
.It Dv e_phnum
This member holds the number of entries in the program header
table.
Thus the product of
.Sy e_phentsize
and
.Sy e_phnum
gives the table's size
in bytes.
If a file has no program header,
.Sy e_phnum
holds the value zero.
.It Dv e_shentsize
This member holds a sections header's size in bytes.
A section header is one
entry in the section header table; all entries are the same size.
.It Dv e_shnum
This member holds the number of entries in the section header table.
Thus
the product of
.Sy e_shentsize
and
.Sy e_shnum
gives the section header table's size in bytes.
If a file has no section
header table,
.Sy e_shnum
holds the value of zero.
.It Dv e_shstrndx
This member holds the section header table index of the entry associated
with the section name string table.
If the file has no section name string
table, this member holds the value
.Dv SHN_UNDEF .
.El
.Pp
An executable or shared object file's program header table is an array of
structures, each describing a segment or other information the system needs
to prepare the program for execution.
An object file
.Em segment
contains one or more
.Em sections .
Program headers are meaningful only for executable and shared object files.
A file specifies its own program header size with the ELF header's
.Sy e_phentsize
and
.Sy e_phnum
members.
As with the ELF executable header, the program header
also has different versions depending on the architecture:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
typedef struct {
        Elf32_Word      p_type;
        Elf32_Off       p_offset;
        Elf32_Addr      p_vaddr;
        Elf32_Addr      p_paddr;
        Elf32_Word      p_filesz;
        Elf32_Word      p_memsz;
        Elf32_Word      p_flags;
        Elf32_Word      p_align;
} Elf32_Phdr;
.Ed
.Bd -literal -offset indent
typedef struct {
        Elf64_Half      p_type;
        Elf64_Half      p_flags;
        Elf64_Off       p_offset;
        Elf64_Addr      p_vaddr;
        Elf64_Addr      p_paddr;
        Elf64_Xword     p_filesz;
        Elf64_Xword     p_memsz;
        Elf64_Xword     p_align;
} Elf64_Phdr;
.Ed
.Pp
The main difference between the 32-bit and the 64-bit program header lies
only in the location of a
.Sy p_flags
member in the total struct.
.Bl -tag -width "p_offset" -offset indent
.It Dv p_type
This member of the Phdr struct tells what kind of segment this array
element describes or how to interpret the array element's information.
.Bl -tag -width "PT_DYNAMIC"
.It Dv PT_NULL
The array element is unused and the other members' values are undefined.
This lets the program header have ignored entries.
.It Dv PT_LOAD
The array element specifies a loadable segment, described by
.Sy p_filesz
and
.Sy p_memsz .
The bytes from the file are mapped to the beginning of the memory
segment.
If the segment's memory size
.Pq Sy p_memsz
is larger than the file size
.Pq Sy p_filesz ,
the

bytes are defined to hold the value 0 and to follow the segment's
initialized area.
The file size may not be larger than the memory size.
Loadable segment entries in the program header table appear in ascending
order, sorted on the
.Sy p_vaddr
member.
.It Dv PT_DYNAMIC
The array element specifies the location and size of the dynamic section,
both in the file and in the memory image of the program.

Each thread in a process loading this file will have the segment's
memory size
.Pq Sy p_memsz
allocated for it, where the bytes up to the segment's file size
.Pq Sy p_filesz
will be initialized with the data in this segment and the remaining
.Dq extra

.It Dv PT_OPENBSD_RANDOMIZE
The array element specifies the location and size of a part of the
memory image of the program that must be filled with random data
before any code in the object is executed.
The memory region specified by a segment of this type may overlap
the region specified by a
.Dv PT_GNU_RELRO
segment, in which case the intersection will be filled with random
data before being marked read-only.
This segment type may occur more than once in a file, but a limit
on the total number of bytes in the segments for an object of no
less than 65536 bytes may be imposed.
.It Dv PT_OPENBSD_WXNEEDED
The array element specifies that a process executing this file may
need to be able to map or protect memory regions as simultaneously
executable and writable.
If the system is unable or unwilling to permit that for this executable
then it may fail immediately.
This segment type is meaningful only for executable files and is
ignored in other objects.

String table sections hold null-terminated character sequences, commonly
called strings.
The object file uses these strings to represent symbol
and section names.
One references a string as an index into the string
table section.
The first byte, which is index zero, is defined to hold
a null character.
Similarly, a string table's last byte is defined to
hold a null character, ensuring null termination for all strings.

.It Dv r_offset
This member gives the location at which to apply the relocation action.
For a relocatable file, the value is the byte offset from the beginning
of the section to the storage unit affected by the relocation.
For an
executable file or shared object, the value is the virtual address of
the storage unit affected by the relocation.
.It Dv r_info
This member gives both the symbol table index with respect to which the
relocation must be made and the type of relocation to apply.
Relocation
types are processor-specific.
When the text refers to a relocation
entry's relocation type or symbol table index, it means the result of
applying
.Dv ELF[32|64]_R_TYPE
or
.Dv ELF[32|64]_R_SYM ,
respectively, to the entry's
.Sy r_info
member.
.It Dv r_addend
This member specifies a constant addend used to compute the value to be
stored into the relocatable field.
.El

The note section is used to hold vendor-specific information that
may be used to help identify a binary's ABI.
It should start with an Elf_Note struct,
followed by the section name and the section description.
The actual note contents follow thereafter.

.Ox
ELF support first appeared in
.Ox 1.2 .
Starting with
.Ox 5.4 ,
all supported platforms use it as the native binary file format.
ELF in itself first appeared in
.At V .
The ELF format is an adopted standard.
