.Sh NAME
.Nm phones
.Nd remote host phone number file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
files are used by
.Xr tip 1
to find phone numbers not included in the
.Xr remote 5
database(s) being used.
.Pp
The default file is
.Pa /etc/phones ,
which is used unless the
.Ev PHONES
environment variable has been set.
.Pa /etc/phones
is world readable by default, and should
.Em not
contain privileged information.
.Pp
The format of the file is a series of lines of the form:
.Pp
.D1 Li <system name>[\ \et]*<phone number>
.Pp
The system name must start at the first character on the line.
The phone number is any sequence of characters terminated by a
.Ql \&,
or the end of the line.
Thus the phone number field can contain arbitrary dialing strings, not
just phone numbers.
.Pp
Certain auto-call units or modems can use
.Ql \&,
in their dialing strings.
For these units (currently Hayes, Courier and Telebit)
.Xr tip 1
will translate a
.Ql \&=
in the phone number to a
.Ql \&,
when actually dialing the number.
.Pp
If the auto-call unit is a Racal-Vadic 831,
.Xr tip 1
will translate a
.Ql \&_
in the phone number to a
.Ql \&= .
.Pp
.Xr tip 1
ignores all lines with a system name other than the one being
looked up.
Comments can be inserted into the file by making the first character
on a line something not used to start any system name in the
.Xr remote 5
database(s) being used, such as
.Ql # .
.Pp
Only one phone number per line is permitted.
To associate more than one phone number with a system name you must
create multiple lines that have the same system name.
.Xr tip 1
will try each number in sequence until it makes a connection or
reaches the end of the file.

@Fixup example files, man pages and phones parsing.

Make '/etc/remote' a working example, with some lengthy comments that
might help people trying to use it.

Remove untruths and beef up documentation for tip(1), remote(5) and
phones(5). In particular remove last reference to the 'cu' tip
interface since we use the 'cu' that comes with uucp, improve
documentation on phone numbers and flesh out documentation on
acu/modems supported. Document PHONES and REMOTE environment
variables.

Cleanup parsing of /etc/phones (so our example can be used) and ignore
lines with empty phone numbers instead of aborting the scan of the
file. This makes /etc/phones parsing consistant with ':pn:' capability
parsing. Don't try to dial empty phone numbers in either case.
