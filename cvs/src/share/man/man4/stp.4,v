@First pass at removing clauses 3 and 4 from NetBSD licenses.

Not sure what's more surprising: how long it took for NetBSD to
catch up to the rest of the BSDs (including UCB), or the amount of
code that NetBSD has claimed for itself without attributing to the
actual authors.

Unlike other PCMCIA adapters which are little-endian, this bridge
provides a big-endian
.Xr pcmcia 4

Therefore, 16 bit drivers need to be made aware of this before they will

@Incomplete section 4 mi manual page cleanup.
- make configuration lines match GENERIC files
- more Xr (hopefully usefule Xr)
- never mention intro(4) on non-physical devices (i.e. protocols), always
mention it for physical devices
- random text style and quoting fixes
- drivers ported from FreeBSD did mention rc.conf instead of hostname.if as
the place to put mediaopt
- some .Tn UNIX -> .Ox replacements
- etc, etc...

The driver provides a big-endian pcmcia bus, which is wrong in the
.Ox
context. Due to missing/incomplete documentation of the chipset it is not
known for sure if the hardware has any byteswapping mode. For sparc64 systems
this can easily be worked around in software, so this will be fixed. For
sparc systems, the fix might impose a serious performance degration and is
subject of further research.
