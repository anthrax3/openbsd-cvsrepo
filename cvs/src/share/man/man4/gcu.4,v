.Nd Intel EP80579 Global Configuration Unit
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "gcu* at pci?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides access to the miibus that is hidden behind the GCU device.
It is used to control PHYs on embedded designs utilizing Intel's EP80579
chips.
.Pp
The GCU also provides access to CAN, SSP and TDM signal strength drivers,
but since they are not supported by
.Ox
the driver does not provide any
functionality related to them.

.Nm
driver first appeared in
.Ox 4.7 .
.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Nm
driver was written by
.An Dariusz Swiderski Aq Mt dms@@openbsd.org ,
partially based on the
.Fx
driver released by Intel under the ISC license.

log
@Use .Lk for HTTP hyperlinks, not .Pa.
Most of the patch from Arto Jonsson <ajonsson at kapsi dot fi>.
jmc@@ agrees in principle that .Lk is the right macro to use.

While here, update a few broken links,
and add missing markup at a few places.
