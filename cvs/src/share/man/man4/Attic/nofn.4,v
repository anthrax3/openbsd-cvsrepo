.Sh NAME
.Nm nofn
.Nd Hifn 7814/7851/7854 HIPP1 crypto accelerator
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "nofn* at pci?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver supports cards based on the
.Tn Hifn
.Tn 7814 ,
.Tn 7851 ,
and
.Tn 7854
.Tn HIPP1
packet processors.
The 7814 and 7854 both contain a public key processor and a random
number generator.
The public key processor registers with the
.Xr crypto 4
subsystem to support modular exponentiation,
and the random number generator provides random bits to the
.Xr random 4
subsystem.
.Pp
Currently, no packet processing is supported.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr crypt 3 ,
.Xr crypto 4 ,
.Xr intro 4 ,
.Xr ipsec 4 ,
.Xr pci 4 ,
.Xr random 4 ,
.Xr crypto 9
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
device driver appeared in
.Ox 3.2 .

log
@Incomplete section 4 mi manual page cleanup.
- make configuration lines match GENERIC files
- more Xr (hopefully usefule Xr)
- never mention intro(4) on non-physical devices (i.e. protocols), always
mention it for physical devices
- random text style and quoting fixes
- drivers ported from FreeBSD did mention rc.conf instead of hostname.if as
the place to put mediaopt
- some .Tn UNIX -> .Ox replacements
- etc, etc...
