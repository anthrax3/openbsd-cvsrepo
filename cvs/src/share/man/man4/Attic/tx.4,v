.Sh NAME
.Nm tx
.Nd SMC 9432 10/100 Mbps Ethernet driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "tx* at pci?"
.Cd "qsphy* at mii?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
interface provides access to the 10Mb/s and 100Mb/s Ethernet networks via the
.Tn SMC
.Tn EPIC
chipset.
This driver provides support for the
.Tn SMC
.Tn EtherPower II 10/100
Ethernet cards.
.Pp
Each of the host's network addresses
is specified at boot time with an
.Dv SIOCSIFADDR
.Xr ioctl 2 .
The
.Nm
interface employs the address resolution protocol described in
.Xr arp 4
to dynamically map between Internet and Ethernet addresses on the local
network.
.Pp
When a
.Nm
interface is brought up, by default, it will attempt to auto-negotiate the
link speed and duplex.
The speeds, in order of attempt, are: 100Mb/s Full Duplex, 100Mb/s Half Duplex,
10 Mb/s Full Duplex, and 10 Mb/s Half Duplex.
.Pp
The
.Nm
supports several media types, which are selected via the
.Xr ifconfig 8
command.
The supported media types are:
.Bl -tag -width 6n -offset indent
.It media autoselect
Attempt to autoselect the media type (default)
.It media 100baseFX mediaopt full-duplex
Use 100baseFX (fiber), full duplex
.It media 100baseFX Op mediaopt half-duplex
Use 100baseFX (fiber), half duplex
.It media 100baseTX mediaopt full-duplex
Use 100baseTX, full duplex
.It media 100baseTX Op mediaopt half-duplex
Use 100baseTX, half duplex
.It media 100baseTX mediaopt loopback
Put the interface into loopback mode
.It media 10baseT mediaopt full-duplex
Use 10baseT, full duplex
.It media 10baseT Op mediaopt half-duplex
Use 10baseT, half duplex
.It media 10baseT mediaopt loopback
Put the interface into loopback mode
.El
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "tx%d: device timeout %d packets"
The device stopped responding.
Device and driver reset follows this error.
.It "tx%d: PCI fatal error occurred (%s)"
One of following errors occurred: PCI Target Abort, PCI Master Abort, Data
Parity Error or Address Parity Error.
Device and driver reset follows this error.
.It "tx%d: WARNING! no link established"
No media connected.
Displayed at startup only.
.It "tx%d: cannot allocate mbuf header/cluster"
Failed to allocate memory for a received packet.
Packet was dropped.
.It "tx%d: can't stop %s DMA"
While resetting, the driver failed to stop the device correctly.

@Incomplete section 4 mi manual page cleanup.
- make configuration lines match GENERIC files
- more Xr (hopefully usefule Xr)
- never mention intro(4) on non-physical devices (i.e. protocols), always
mention it for physical devices
- random text style and quoting fixes
- drivers ported from FreeBSD did mention rc.conf instead of hostname.if as
the place to put mediaopt
- some .Tn UNIX -> .Ox replacements
- etc, etc...
