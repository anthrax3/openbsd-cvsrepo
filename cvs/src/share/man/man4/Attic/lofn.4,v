.Sh NAME
.Nm lofn
.Nd Hifn 6500 crypto accelerator
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "lofn* at pci?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver supports cards using the
.Tn Hifn 6500
public key processor.
This chip has both a random number generator and a large
number processor.
The random number generator provides random bits to the
.Xr random 4
subsystem, while the large number processor registers with the
.Xr crypto 4
subsystem to support modular exponentiation.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr crypt 3 ,
.Xr crypto 4 ,
.Xr intro 4 ,
.Xr ipsec 4 ,
.Xr pci 4 ,
.Xr random 4 ,
.Xr crypto 9
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
device driver appeared in
.Ox 3.0 .

log
@Incomplete section 4 mi manual page cleanup.
- make configuration lines match GENERIC files
- more Xr (hopefully usefule Xr)
- never mention intro(4) on non-physical devices (i.e. protocols), always
mention it for physical devices
- random text style and quoting fixes
- drivers ported from FreeBSD did mention rc.conf instead of hostname.if as
the place to put mediaopt
- some .Tn UNIX -> .Ox replacements
- etc, etc...
