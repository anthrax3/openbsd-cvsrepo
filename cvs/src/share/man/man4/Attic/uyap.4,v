.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm uyap
.Nd USB YAP phone firmware loader
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "uyap* at uhub?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver downloads firmware into a YAP phone.
The device will then disconnect and reappear as a composite device with
two audio pipes (handled by
.Xr uaudio 4 )
and an HID device (handled by
.Xr uhid 4 ) .
.Sh FILES
The driver needs a firmware file,
which is loaded on demand when the device is attached:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent -compact
.It Pa /etc/firmware/uyap
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr intro 4 ,
.Xr uaudio 4 ,
.Xr uhid 4 ,
.Xr uhub 4 ,
.Xr usb 4
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver appeared in
.Nx 1.6 .
.Ox
support appeared in
.Ox 2.9 .

log
@First pass at removing clauses 3 and 4 from NetBSD licenses.

Not sure what's more surprising: how long it took for NetBSD to
catch up to the rest of the BSDs (including UCB), or the amount of
code that NetBSD has claimed for itself without attributing to the
actual authors.

@filesystem firmware loading for uyap(4).  this should work, i wrote it very
carefully.  unfortunately, we cannot find anyone who has one of these devices
in our entire user community, thus far.  commit it anyways.  whoever finds
one can contact me if there is a problem.

- more/better xrefs
- sync .Cd lines with actual configuration files
- intro(4) reference police
- huge usb(4) update
- follow mdoc.samples suggested man page section ordering when necessary
- add netintro(4) and hostname.if(5) xrefs to all ethernet drivers

log
@Add a transient driver for the Y@@P phone that downloads firmware into
the EZ-USB chip. After downloading the firmware the device detaches and
then reattaches as a composite device (audio + HID). From NetBSD.
/* XXX - untested */

Commented out in GENERIC for now, since this sounds like a kind of rare and
weird device that no one would have. But it might be useful to have an
example driver like this in the tree in case we see more (important) USB
devices in the future using the EZ-USB.
