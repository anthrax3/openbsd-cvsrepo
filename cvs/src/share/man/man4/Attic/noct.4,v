.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm noct
.Nd NetOctave NSP2000 crypto accelerator
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "noct* at pci?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver supports cards based on the
.Tn NetOctave
.Tn NSP2000
packet processor.
The
.Tn NSP2000
contains a public key processor, random number generator, and
packet processor.
The random number generator provides random bits to the
.Xr random 4
subsystem.
.Pp
Currently, the packet processor registers with the
.Xr crypto 9
subsystem only to support MD5, SHA1, DES-CBC, and Triple-DES for
.Xr ipsec 4
and
.Xr crypto 4 .
The public key engine is not yet supported.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr crypt 3 ,
.Xr crypto 4 ,
.Xr intro 4 ,
.Xr ipsec 4 ,
.Xr pci 4 ,
.Xr random 4 ,
.Xr crypto 9
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
device driver appeared in
.Ox 3.2 .

log
@Incomplete section 4 mi manual page cleanup.
- make configuration lines match GENERIC files
- more Xr (hopefully usefule Xr)
- never mention intro(4) on non-physical devices (i.e. protocols), always
mention it for physical devices
- random text style and quoting fixes
- drivers ported from FreeBSD did mention rc.conf instead of hostname.if as
the place to put mediaopt
- some .Tn UNIX -> .Ox replacements
- etc, etc...
