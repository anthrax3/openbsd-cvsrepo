.Nm bt
.Nd Buslogic SCSI adapter driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "bt0 at isa? port 0x330 irq ? drq ?"
.Cd "scsibus* at bt?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver supports the following Buslogic SCSI adapters:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width -offset indent -compact
.It Buslogic BT-445		VLB
.It Buslogic BT-74x		EISA
.It Buslogic BT-9[45][68]	PCI
.El
.Pp
The Buslogic BT-930 is not supported.
.Pp
The PCI versions of this card will require the Buslogic BIOS
"Advanced Options" suboption called "Set ISA Compatible IO Port"
to be set to the value "Primary" or "Alternate".
Some cards have an option called "Set host adapter IO port address as default"
instead; for those boards you should set the value to "false".
