.Sh NAME
.Nm wx
.Nd Intel Gigabit Ethernet driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "wx* at pci? dev ? function ?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for Intel Gigabit Ethernet PCI cards based on the
.Tn i82452
chipset such as the Intel Pro/1000, PRO1000F, and PRO1000T
Gigabit Server Adapter.
.Pp
Various models support the following media types and options (as given to
.Xr ifconfig 8 )
are supported:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width XXX -offset indent
.It Cm media No autoselect
Enable autoselection of media type and options.
Note that this media type is only available with
adapters that have external PHYs or built-in autonegotiation logic.
.It Cm media No 1000baseSX Cm mediaopt No full-duplex
Set 1000Mbps (Gigabit Ethernet) operation on fiber and force full-duplex mode.
.It Cm media No 1000baseSX
Set 1000Mbps (Gigabit Ethernet) operation on fiber.
.It Cm media No 1000baseTX
Set 1000Mbps (Gigabit Ethernet) operation on copper.
.It Cm media No 100baseTX Cm mediaopt No full-duplex
Set 100Mbps (Fast Ethernet) operation and force full-duplex mode.
.It Cm media No 100baseTX Cm mediaopt No half-duplex
Set 100Mbps (Fast Ethernet) operation and force half-duplex mode.
.It Cm media No 10baseT Cm mediaopt No full-duplex
Set 10baseT (UTP) operation and force full-duplex mode.
.It Cm media No 10baseT Cm mediaopt No half-duplex
Set 10baseT (UTP) operation and force half-duplex mode.
.El
.Pp
For more information on configuring this device, see
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
To view a list of media types and options supported by your card try
.Ic ifconfig -m <device> .
For example,
.Ic ifconfig -m wx0 .
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "wx%d: can't map registers"
A fatal initialization error has occurred.
.It "wx%d: couldn't map interrupt"
A fatal initialization error has occurred.
.It "wx%d: couldn't establish interrupt"
The device failed to allocate an interrupt (irq) line.
.It "wx%d: len (%lx) over a page for the receive ring"
The size of the receive ring is larger than the hardware page size.
.It "wx%d: could not allocate rcv descriptors"
The device failed to allocate memory for the receive descriptors.
.It "wx%d: rcv descriptors not 4KB aligned"
The memory management system returned memory for the receive descriptors
that was not aligned correctly.
.It "wx%d: len (%lx) over a page for the xmit ring"
The size of the transmit ring is larger than the hardware page size.
.It "wx%d: could not allocate xmt descriptors"
The device failed to allocate memory for the transmit descriptors.
.It "wx%d: xmt descriptors not 4KB aligned"
The memory management system returned memory for the transmit descriptors
that was not aligned correctly.
.It "wx%d: failed to do common attach (%d)"
The operating system independent section of the device driver
initialization failed.
.It "wx%d: link intr 0x%x"
The device has sensed a change in its link to the network.
.It "wx%d: packet with errors (%x)"
.It "wx%d: receive descriptor with no mbuf"
.It "wx%d: lost sync with partial packet"
.It "wx%d: null mbuf in gc"
.It ""
.It "wx%d: excess collisions"
The device has dropped a packet because too many collisions were seen
when trying to send it.
.It "wx%d: lost carrier"
The device has lost link integrity with the network, most likely a cabling
problem.
.It "wx%d: nactive < 0?"
.It "wx%d: swdpio did not clear"
.It ""
.It "wx%d: link never came up"
The device never saw the link to the network established.
.It "wx%d: device timeout"
The device has stopped responding to the network,
or there is a problem with the network connection (cable).
.It "wx%d: could not re-init device"
An error occurred when trying to reset the device.
.It "wx%d: could not set up rbufs"
