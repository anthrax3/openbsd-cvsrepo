.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm ises
.Nd Securealink PCC-ISES hardware crypto accelerator
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "ises* at pci?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver supports cards containing the Securealink PCC-ISES chipset.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver at the moment only provides strong random data to the
.Xr random 4
subsystem.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr intro 4 ,
.Xr pci 4 ,
.Xr random 4
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
device driver appeared in
.Ox 2.9 .
.Sh BUGS
The cryptographic functions are not yet supported.
Also not yet supported are the chip's two LNAUs (Large Number Arithmetic
Units), which would be useful in OpenSSL applications.

1.5
log
@Incomplete section 4 mi manual page cleanup.
- make configuration lines match GENERIC files
- more Xr (hopefully usefule Xr)
- never mention intro(4) on non-physical devices (i.e. protocols), always
mention it for physical devices
- random text style and quoting fixes
- drivers ported from FreeBSD did mention rc.conf instead of hostname.if as
the place to put mediaopt
- some .Tn UNIX -> .Ox replacements
- etc, etc...

@- don't claim to register to accelerate ipsec functions when this driver
does not do so at the moment.
- for now remove man page crossreferences for crypto related functions.
