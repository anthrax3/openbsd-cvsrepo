.Sh NAME
.Nm opl
.Nd Yamaha OPL2 and OPL3 FM synthesizer driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "opl* at cmpci?"
.Cd "opl* at eso?"
.Cd "opl* at ess?"
.Cd "opl0 at isa? port 0x388"
.Cd "opl* at sb?"
.Cd "opl* at yds?"
.Cd "midi* at opl?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the Yamaha OPL2 (YM3812) and OPL3
(YMF262) chips.
These are FM synthesizer chips and are capable
of producing a wide range of (mostly awful) sounds.
.Pp
Access to the device is done through the MIDI driver.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver usually attaches to a sound card, but it can also sit
directly on the ISA bus.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr cmpci 4 ,
.Xr eso 4 ,
.Xr ess 4 ,
.Xr isa 4 ,
.Xr midi 4 ,
.Xr sb 4 ,
.Xr yds 4
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
device driver first appeared in
.Nx 1.4 .

log
@First pass at removing clauses 3 and 4 from NetBSD licenses.

Not sure what's more surprising: how long it took for NetBSD to
catch up to the rest of the BSDs (including UCB), or the amount of
code that NetBSD has claimed for itself without attributing to the
actual authors.

@Incomplete section 4 mi manual page cleanup.
- make configuration lines match GENERIC files
- more Xr (hopefully usefule Xr)
- never mention intro(4) on non-physical devices (i.e. protocols), always
mention it for physical devices
- random text style and quoting fixes
- drivers ported from FreeBSD did mention rc.conf instead of hostname.if as
the place to put mediaopt
- some .Tn UNIX -> .Ox replacements
- etc, etc...

@- remove all trailing whitespace
     * except when it is escaped with a `\' at the end of the line
- fix remaining .Nm usage as well
- this is from a patch I received from kwesterback@@home.com, who has been
  working on some scripts for fixing formatting errors in mdoc'd man pages

Ok, so there could be a cost/benefit debate with this commit, but since I have
the patch we might as well commit it...
