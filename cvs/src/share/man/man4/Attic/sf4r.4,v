.Sh NAME
.Nm sf4r
.Nd SoundForte RadioLink SF64-PCR FM radio device driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "sf4r0   at pci? flags 0x00"
.Cd "radio* at sf4r0"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the SF64-PCR FM radio tuners.
.Pp
The SF64-PCR cards are stereo FM tuners that allow to tune in the range
87.5 - 108.0 MHz, report signal status on the current frequency, force
audio output to mono, perform hardware signal search, and have an internal
AFC.
.Pp
The card is based on the TEA5757 chip, see
.Xr radio 4
for details.
.Pp
The flags control the driver behavior. For example, with flags 0x01 the driver
will assume that there is a TEA5759 chip is used.
.Sh BUGS
Because MediaForte put FM801 on the board, the current driver cannot
distinguish sound cards based on FM801 and SF64-PCR.
.Sh SEE ALSO

.Xr radio 4 ,
.Xr radio 9
