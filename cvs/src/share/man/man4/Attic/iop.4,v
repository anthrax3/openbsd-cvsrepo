.Nm iop
.Nd I2O RAID controller
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "iop* at pci?"
.Cd "iopsp* at iop?"
.Cd "ioprbs* at iop?"
.Cd "option I2OVERBOSE"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for
.Tn PCI
I/O processors conforming to the
.Tn I2O
specification, revision 1.5 and above.
.Sh IOCTL INTERFACE
The following structures and constants are defined in
.Aq Pa dev/i2o/iopio.h .
Note that the headers
.Aq Pa sys/types.h ,
.Aq Pa sys/device.h
and
.Aq Pa dev/i2o/i2o.h
are prerequisites and must therefore be included beforehand.
.Bl -tag -width OTTF
.It Dv IOPIOCPT (struct ioppt)
Submit a message to the IOP and return the reply.
Note that the return value of this ioctl is not affected by completion status
as indicated by the reply.
.Bd -literal
struct ioppt {
	void	*pt_msg;	/* pointer to message buffer */
	size_t	pt_msglen;	/* message buffer size in bytes */
	void	*pt_reply;	/* pointer to reply buffer */
	size_t	pt_replylen;	/* reply buffer size in bytes */
	int	pt_timo;	/* completion timeout in ms */
	int	pt_nbufs;	/* number of transfers */
	struct	ioppt_buf pt_bufs[IOP_MAX_MSG_XFERS]; /* transfers */
};

struct ioppt_buf {
	void	*ptb_data;	/* pointer to buffer */
	size_t	ptb_datalen;	/* buffer size in bytes */
	int	ptb_out;	/* non-zero if transfer is to IOP */
};
.Ed
.Pp
The minimum timeout value that may be specified is 1000ms.
All other values must not exceed the
.Nm
driver's operational limits.
.It Dv IOPIOCGSTATUS (struct iovec)
Request the latest available status record from the IOP.
This special-case ioctl is provided as the I2O_EXEC_STATUS_GET message
does not post replies, and can therefore not be safely issued using
the IOPIOCPT ioctl.
.El
.Pp
The following ioctls may block while attempting to acquire the
.Nm
driver's configuration lock, and may fail if the acquisition times out.
.Bl -tag -width OTTF
.It Dv IOPIOCGLCT (struct iovec)
Retrieve the
.Nm
driver's copy of the logical configuration table.
This copy of the LCT matches the current device configuration, but is not
necessarily the latest available version of the LCT.
.It Dv IOPIOCRECONFIG
Request that the
.Nm
driver scan all bus ports, retrieve the latest version of the LCT, and
attach or detach devices as necessary.
Note that higher-level reconfiguration tasks (such as logically re-scanning
SCSI buses) will not be performed by this ioctl.
.It Dv IOPIOCGTIDMAP (struct iovec)
Retrieve the TID to device map.
This map indicates which targets are configured, and what the corresponding
device name for each is.
Although at any given point it contains the same number of entries as the LCT,
the number of entries should be determined using the iov_len field from
the returned iovec.
.Bd -literal
struct iop_tidmap {
	u_short	it_tid;
	u_short	it_flags;
	char	it_dvname[sizeof(((struct device *)NULL)->dv_xname)];
};

@First pass at removing clauses 3 and 4 from NetBSD licenses.

Not sure what's more surprising: how long it took for NetBSD to
catch up to the rest of the BSDs (including UCB), or the amount of
code that NetBSD has claimed for itself without attributing to the
actual authors.

- make configuration lines match GENERIC files
- more Xr (hopefully usefule Xr)
- never mention intro(4) on non-physical devices (i.e. protocols), always
mention it for physical devices
- random text style and quoting fixes
- drivers ported from FreeBSD did mention rc.conf instead of hostname.if as
the place to put mediaopt
- some .Tn UNIX -> .Ox replacements
- etc, etc...
