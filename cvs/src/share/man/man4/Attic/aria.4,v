.Sh NAME
.Nm aria
.Nd Aria 16 audio device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "aria0 at isa? port 0x280 irq 10 drq 0 flags 0x1"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for sound cards based on Sierra Semiconductor's
Aria chipset.
Cards based on this chipset are capable of recording and playing
8- or 16-bit samples in mono or stereo up to 44.1kHz.
Some chipsets only play linear or ADCPM, but others will also play
Mu-law and A-law sounds.
Three different mixer configurations are available.
.Pp
The I/O Port Base is selected from 0x280, 0x290, 0x2a0 and 0x2b0.
The selection method depends on the board.
The Aria takes 8 ports.
.Pp
The IRQ is selected from 10, 11, or 12.
.Pp
The DRQ line is chosen from 5 or 6, this driver will work with or without
a DRQ.
If no DRQ is given, then the
.Nm
driver will simply use Direct I/O.
.Pp
The flags currently supported are 0x1, for the Prometheus Aria 16/Aria 16se.
This flag tells the driver to initialize the card.
It is a weird and undocumented piece of horribleness, but the card
will not respond until you twiddle with the joystick port.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr audio 4 ,
.Xr intro 4 ,
.Xr isa 4
.Sh AUTHORS
.An Roland C. Dowdeswell Aq roland@@imrryr.org
.Sh BUGS
The driver has only been tested on a Prometheus Aria 16.
.Pp
No DMA support, yet, so don't bother setting a DRQ.
.Pp
The full-duplex features are horribly inconsistent (i.e., unusable).
.Pp
The card sometimes drops out, and needs to be reset.
This can be accomplished by opening and closing
.Pa /dev/audio ,
e.g.,
.Dq echo -n >/dev/audio
.Pp
The joystick and MIDI port interfaces are not supported.

@Incomplete section 4 mi manual page cleanup.
- make configuration lines match GENERIC files
- more Xr (hopefully usefule Xr)
- never mention intro(4) on non-physical devices (i.e. protocols), always
mention it for physical devices
- random text style and quoting fixes
- drivers ported from FreeBSD did mention rc.conf instead of hostname.if as
the place to put mediaopt
- some .Tn UNIX -> .Ox replacements
- etc, etc...
