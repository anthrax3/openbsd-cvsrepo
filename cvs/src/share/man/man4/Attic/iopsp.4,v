.Dt IOPSP 4
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm iopsp
.Nd I2O SCSI port driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "iopsp* at iop?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for I2O SCSI bus adapter ports and child
peripherals.
.Pp
IOPs present each child peripheral attached to a bus adapter port as an
individual device.
In order to present the appearance of a bus, the
.Nm
driver groups child peripherals by controlling port.
.Pp
On IOPs containing a SCSI port and block or tape driver modules, some SCSI
devices may not be directly accessible.
For each inaccessible device, a message will be displayed during configuration.
For example:
.Bd -literal
	iopsp0: target 0,0 (tid 70): in use by tid 47
.Ed
.Pp
Such devices will usually be indirectly accessible as block devices, either
individually or as part of an array.
For accessing these, there is the
.Nm ioprbs
driver.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr intro 4 ,
.Xr iop 4 ,
.Xr ioprbs 4 ,
.Xr scsibus 4
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver first appeared in
.Nx 1.6 ,
.Ox
support was added in
.Ox 3.0 .
.Sh AUTHORS
.An -nosplit
The
.Nm
driver was written by
.An Andrew Doran Aq Mt ad@@netbsd.org
and ported to
.Ox 3.0
by
.An Niklas Hallqvist Aq Mt niklas@@openbsd.org
and
.An Michael Shalayeff Aq Mt mickey@@openbsd.org .

@First pass at removing clauses 3 and 4 from NetBSD licenses.

Not sure what's more surprising: how long it took for NetBSD to
catch up to the rest of the BSDs (including UCB), or the amount of
code that NetBSD has claimed for itself without attributing to the
actual authors.

OK deraadt@@

@Incomplete section 4 mi manual page cleanup.
- make configuration lines match GENERIC files
- more Xr (hopefully usefule Xr)
- never mention intro(4) on non-physical devices (i.e. protocols), always
mention it for physical devices
- random text style and quoting fixes
- drivers ported from FreeBSD did mention rc.conf instead of hostname.if as
the place to put mediaopt
- some .Tn UNIX -> .Ox replacements
- etc, etc...
