.Sh NAME
.Nm ich
.Nd Intel 82801AA/AB and 440MX PCI audio driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "ich* at pci? dev ? function ?"
.Cd "audio* at ich?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the AC97-based audio present on the Intel
82801AA/AB I/O controller hub (ICH/ICH0),
82810BA I/O controller hub (ICH2)
and 82440MX chipset.
The
.Nm
DMA engine supports full-duplex operation and has separate channels
for line input and microphone.
Unfortunately, simultaneous recording from both line and microphone inputs
is not supported due to the current
.Xr ac97 4
design.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr ac97 4 ,
.Xr audio 4 ,
.Xr mixer 4
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
device driver appeared in
.Ox 2.8 .
.Sh BUGS
This chipset supports only 48KHz rate for both DAC and ADC operation,
unfortunately some audio applications have poor support for this rate
and mpg123 is one of those cases.
