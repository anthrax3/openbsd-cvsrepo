.Sh NAME
.Nm gtp
.Nd Gemtek PCI FM radio device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "gtp*   at pci? flags 0x00"
.Cd "radio* at gtp?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the Gemtek PCI and Guillemot MaxiRadio FM2000
FM radio tuners.
.Pp
The Gemtek PCI cards are stereo FM tuners that can tune in the range
87.5 \- 108.0 MHz, report signal status and stereo/mono on the current
frequency, force audio output to mono, perform hardware signal search,
and have an internal AFC.
.Pp
The card is based on the TEA5757 chip; see
.Xr radio 4
for details.
.Pp
The flags control the driver behavior.
For example, with flags 0x01 the driver
will assume that a TEA5759 chip is used.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr intro 4 ,
.Xr pci 4 ,
.Xr radio 4 ,
.Xr radio 9
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
device driver appeared in
.Ox 3.2 .
.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Nm
driver and the man page was written by
.An Vladimir Popov Aq Mt jumbo@@narod.ru .
.Sh BUGS
It is impossible to determine which frequency the card is tuned to.
Thus, the driver will report an internally stored value even if it is not
correct (changed by some program that uses direct port access).

log
@Incomplete section 4 mi manual page cleanup.
- make configuration lines match GENERIC files
- more Xr (hopefully usefule Xr)
- never mention intro(4) on non-physical devices (i.e. protocols), always
mention it for physical devices
- random text style and quoting fixes
- drivers ported from FreeBSD did mention rc.conf instead of hostname.if as
the place to put mediaopt
- some .Tn UNIX -> .Ox replacements
- etc, etc...

@Guillemot/maxiradio was a rebadged gemtek/pr103.
the mr(4) was not really tested and therefore is now replaced
w/ a tested gtp(4), renamed pci ids too.
