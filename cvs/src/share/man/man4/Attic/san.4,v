.Nd Sangoma Technologies AFT T1/E1 network device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "san* at pci?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
device driver supports the Sangoma Technologies Inc AFT Series Network
cards.
This includes the following models:
.Pp
.Bl -item -offset indent -compact
.It
Sangoma AFT A101 PCI
.It
Sangoma AFT A102 PCI
.El
.Pp
The following media types and options (as given to
.Xr ifconfig 8 )
are supported:
.Bl -tag -width xxx -offset indent
.It Cm media No T1
Configure Sangoma card for T1, B8ZS, ESF, all channels
(default).
.It Cm media No T1-AMI
Configure Sangoma card for T1, AMI, ESF, all channels.
.It Cm media No E1
Configure Sangoma card for E1, HDB3, NCRC4, all channels.
.It Cm media No E1-AMI
Configure Sangoma card for E1, AMI, NCRC4, all channels.
.El
.Pp
If no media options are present, the
.Nm
driver places the card into default mode (T1, B8ZS, ESF, all channels).
.Pp
Use
.Xr ifconfig 8
to change the timeslot range for this card.
The following format is supported:
.Bl -tag -width xxx -offset indent
.It Cm # ifconfig san0 timeslot all
Enable all channels for this card.
.It Cm # ifconfig san0 timeslot 1-10
Enable channels 1-10 for this card.
.It Cm # ifconfig san0 timeslot 1-10.14-15.20
Enable channels 1-10, 14-15 and 20 for this card.
.El
.Pp
If the timeslot option is not present, the
.Nm
driver configures the card to use all the channels.
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "san0: couldn't map memory"
A fatal initialization error has occurred.
.It "san0: No PCI memory allocated for CPU #B"
A fatal initialization error has occurred.
.It "san0: couldn't map interrupt"
A fatal initialization error has occurred.
.It "san0: IRQ not allocated"

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
device driver first appeared in
.Ox 3.6 .
.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Nm
device driver and this manual page were written by
.An Alex Feldman .
.Sh BUGS
There is no hardware documentation.
.Pp
There appears to be a memory corruption bug during device
initialization.
.Pp
Since Sangoma stopped supporting the driver,
it is unlikely that these bugs will be fixed.
