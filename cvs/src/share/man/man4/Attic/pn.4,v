Lite-On 82c168/82c169 PNIC fast ethernet device driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "pn* at pci? dev ? function ?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for PCI ethernet adapters and embedded
controllers based on the Lite-On 82c168 and 82c169 fast ethernet
controller chips. This includes the LinkSys LNE100TX, the
Bay Networks Netgear FA310TX revision D1, the Matrox Networks
FastNIC 10/100, the Kingston KNE110TX (EtherRx VP),
and various other commodity fast ethernet cards.
.Pp
The Lite-On chips use bus master DMA and are designed to be
DEC 'tulip' workalikes. Many vendors that formerly based their
designs around the DEC 21x4x devices are now using the PNIC
instead. The chips support both an internal transceiver
and external transceivers via an MII bus. The Lite-On parts are
advertised as being register compatible with the DEC 21x4x
controllers; however, there are some differences in the way the
EEPROM and MII access is done. The PNIC controllers support both
10 and 100Mbps speeds in either full or half duplex.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media types:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
.It autoselect
Enable autoselection of the media type and options.
The user can manually override
the autoselected mode by adding media options to the appropriate
.Pa /etc/hostname.pnX
file.
.It 10baseT/UTP
Set 10Mbps operation. The
.Ar mediaopt
option can also be used to select either
.Ar full-duplex
or
.Ar half-duplex modes.
.It 100baseTX
Set 100Mbps (fast ethernet) operation. The
.Ar mediaopt
option can also be used to select either
.Ar full-duplex
or
.Ar half-duplex
modes.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media options:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
.It full-duplex
Force full duplex operation
.It half-duplex
Force half duplex operation.
.El
.Pp
Note that the 100baseTX media type is only available if supported
by the adapter.
For more information on configuring this device, see
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "pn%d: couldn't map memory"
A fatal initialization error has occurred.
.It "pn%d: couldn't map interrupt"
A fatal initialization error has occurred.
.It "pn%d: watchdog timeout"
The device has stopped responding to the network, or there is a problem with
the network connection (cable).
.It "pn%d: no memory for rx list"
The driver failed to allocate an mbuf for the receiver ring.
.It "pn%d: no memory for tx list"
The driver failed to allocate an mbuf for the transmitter ring when
allocating a pad buffer or collapsing an mbuf chain into a cluster.
.It "pn%d: chip is in D3 power state -- setting to D0"
This message applies only to adapters which support power
management. Some operating systems place the controller in low power
mode when shutting down, and some PCI BIOSes fail to bring the chip
out of this state before configuring it. The controller loses all of
its PCI configuration in the D3 state, so if the BIOS does not set
it back to full power mode in time, it won't be able to configure it
correctly. The driver tries to detect this condition and bring
the adapter back to the D0 (full power) state, but this may not be
enough to return the driver to a fully operational condition. If
you see this message at boot time and the driver fails to attach
the device as a network interface, you will have to perform second
warm boot to have the device properly configured.
.Pp
Note that this condition only occurs when warm booting from another
operating system. If you power down your system prior to booting
.Ox ,
the card should be configured correctly.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
device driver first appeared in
.Fx 3.0 .
.Ox
support first appeared in
.Ox 2.5 .
.Sh AUTHOR
The
.Nm
driver was written by
.An Bill Paul Aq wpaul@@ctr.columbia.edu .
.Sh BUGS
The internal NWAY support on the 82c168 chips is horribly broken, which
means that autoselection will not work, except maybe for half-duplex
10Mbps links. In order to use other modes (e.g. 100Mbps) it will be
necessary to
use
.Xr ifconfig 8
to set the interface manually. Autoselection for 82c169 boards using
MII transceivers should work correctly.

The
.Nm
driver currently only supports cards with external transceivers
connected to the PNIC controller via its MII bus. This is because
the author had no boards available for testing which made use of the
internal transceiver. Most of the PNIC implementations on the market
today use an external PHY, so hopefully this will not present any
serious problems. Code to support the internal transceiver may be
added later if hardware becomes available.
