.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm ffs_softupdates
.Nd asynchronous file system writes
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm FFS_SOFTUPDATES
kernel config option enables a scheme that uses partial ordering of
buffer cache operations to allow metadata updates in the fast filesystem
to happen asynchronously, increasing write performance significantly.
Normally, the
.Em ffs
filesystem writes metadata updates synchronously which exacts
a performance penalty in favor of filesystem integrity.
With
.Em soft updates ,
you gain the performance of asynchronous writes while retaining the safety
of synchronous metadata updates.
.Pp
.Em Soft Updates
must be enabled on a per-filesystem basis.  To do this, boot into
single user mode and run
.Dq tunefs -s enable special
on each character special disk device you want to enable
.Em soft updates
on, then run
.Dq reboot -n .
.Sh CAVEATS
Soft updates should be considered experimental at this time.
.Pp
CPUs with a small kernel address space, such as the sun4 and
sun4c, do not have enough kernel memory to support
.Em Soft Updates .
Attempts to use
.Em Soft Updates
on these CPUs will cause a kernel hang or panic after a short period of
use as the kernel will quickly run out of memory.  This is not related
to the amount of physical memory present in the machine--it is a limitation
of the CPU architecture.
.Pp
There should be a
.Xr mount 2
option to enable
.Em soft updates .
.br
The current license for
.Nm
is more restrictive than the rest of the
.Ox
kernel; this will be changed at a future date.

@Mention you should not use soft updates on sun4 or sun4c due to the
small amount of kvm supported by those CPUs.
