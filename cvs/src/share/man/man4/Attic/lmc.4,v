.Sh NAME
.Nm lmc
.Nd Lan Media Corporation SSI/T1/DS1/HSSI/DS3 card device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "lmc* at pci?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the Lan Media Corporation SSI, T1/DS1, HSSI, and DS3
PCI WAN adapters based on the DEC 21140 Ethernet chip.
The adapters use a DEC 21140 Ethernet chip for the PCI bus interface.
Leaving the bus interface chip, the data path goes through a field programmable
gate array, where HDLC processing is accomplished.
Leaving the FPGA, there are FIFO buffers and the DS1, DS3, and V.35 drive
circuitry.
.Pp
The intent is to provide a synchronous serial link with HDLC framing at speeds
of up to 10Mbps (for the SSI card), 52Mbps (for the HSSI card), BNC connectors
for 45Mbps operation without a CSU/DSU (DS3 card), and an RJ45 jack for
T1/E1 operation without a CSU/DSU (T1/DS1 card).
.Pp
The card will automatically use HDLC framing and defaults to external clock
source.
For the DS1 and DS3 cards with built-in CSU/DSU functionality,
the clock source is always external (from CSU/DSU).
The ability to set cable length is not currently implemented.
.Pp
Using the
.Xr sppp 4
driver, you can also use the ppp protocol.
In either case, the
.Nm
interface should be configured as a point-to-point
link.
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "lmc0: couldn't map interrupt"
A fatal initialization error has occurred.
.It "lmc0: couldn't establish interrupt"
A fatal initialization error has occurred.
.It "lmc0: enabling keepalive"
Cisco HDLC keepalive packets will be transmitted.
.It "lmc0: disabling keepalive"
Cisco HDLC keepalive packets will not be transmitted.
.It "lmc0: clock internal"
The card is using internal clocking for the line.
.It "lmc0: clock external"
The card is using external clocking for the line.
.It "lmc0: asserting DTR and RTS"
The card is sending DTR and RTS signals on the line.
.It "lmc0: deasserting DTR and RTS"
The card is not sending DTR and RTS signals on the line.
.It "lmc0: Abnormal interrupt"
The card received an incomplete request.
This may be a sign of a hardware fault.
.It "lmc0: tx_intr: failed to dequeue mbuf?!?"
Only available if compiled with LMC_DEBUG.
.It "lmc0: txput: tx not running"
Problem from tulip.
Only available if compiled with LMC_DEBUG.

- make configuration lines match GENERIC files
- more Xr (hopefully usefule Xr)
- never mention intro(4) on non-physical devices (i.e. protocols), always
mention it for physical devices
- random text style and quoting fixes
- drivers ported from FreeBSD did mention rc.conf instead of hostname.if as
the place to put mediaopt
- some .Tn UNIX -> .Ox replacements
- etc, etc...

@- remove all trailing whitespace
     * except when it is escaped with a `\' at the end of the line
- fix remaining .Nm usage as well
- this is from a patch I received from kwesterback@@home.com, who has been
  working on some scripts for fixing formatting errors in mdoc'd man pages

Ok, so there could be a cost/benefit debate with this commit, but since I have
the patch we might as well commit it...

driver provides support for the Lan Media Corporation SSI, HSSI, and DS3 PCI
WAN adapters based on the DEC 21140 ethernet chip (with supporting
chips to handle the HDLC framing, and synchronous serial interface.)  The intent
is to provide a synchronous serial link with HDLC framing at speeds
of up to 10Mbps (for the SSI card), 52Mbps (for the HSSI card) and DSX jacks
for 45Mbps operation without a CSU/DSU (DS3 card).

The card will automatically use HDLC framing and defaults to external clock source.  It should be configured as any point-to-point link.

@The proper order of the ``introductory'' macros in a man page is .Dd/.Dt/.Os.
Out of the approximately 1450 man pages, only about 90 of them were wrong.
Thanks to kwesterback@@home.com for coming up with a script and patch to repair
this. The patch also inserted a .Os macro in the few man pages that were
missing one.
