.Sh NAME
.Nm sequencer
.Nd OSS-compatible MIDI sequencer device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "pseudo-device sequencer" Op Ar count
.Pp
.Fd #include <sys/types.h>
.Fd #include <sys/midiio.h>
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
device provides an event-oriented interface simultaneously
to all MIDI ports.
Events sent to or received from this device not only contain the
actual MIDI events, but also timing information.
The kernel will make sure that data is sent to the physical
device at the indicated time.
The
.Nm
device uses the
.Xr midi 4
devices internally and they are unavailable when used by the
.Nm
device.
.Pp
The API for the
.Nm
device is binary compatible with the OSS sequencer
interface.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver first appeared in

.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Nm
driver was written by
.An Lennart Augustsson .

log
@First pass at removing clauses 3 and 4 from NetBSD licenses.

Not sure what's more surprising: how long it took for NetBSD to
catch up to the rest of the BSDs (including UCB), or the amount of
code that NetBSD has claimed for itself without attributing to the
actual authors.
