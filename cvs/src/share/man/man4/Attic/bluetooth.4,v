.Sh NAME
.Nm bluetooth
.Nd Bluetooth protocol family
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In netbt/bluetooth.h
.In netbt/hci.h
.In netbt/l2cap.h
.In netbt/rfcomm.h
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Bluetooth protocol family sockets all use a
.Ar sockaddr_bt
structure which contains a Bluetooth Device Address (BDADDR).
This consists of a six byte string in least significant byte
first order.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
struct sockaddr_bt {
	uint8_t		bt_len;
	sa_family_t	bt_family;
	bdaddr_t	bt_bdaddr;
	uint16_t	bt_psm;
	uint8_t		bt_channel;
};
.Ed
.Pp
The local address used by the socket can be set with
.Xr bind 2 .
.Pp
.Ox
provides support for the following devices:
.Ss Human Interface Devices
.Bl -tag -width 12n -offset ind -compact
.It Xr btkbd 4
Bluetooth keyboard support
.It Xr btms 4
Bluetooth mouse support
.El
.Sh PROTOCOLS
Protocols included are:
.Bl -tag -width XX
.It Cm BTPROTO_HCI
This gives raw access to the Host Controller Interface of local devices
using the HCI protocol as described in the Bluetooth Core Specification.
Any user may open an HCI socket but there are limitations on what
unprivileged users can send and receive.
The local address specified by
.Xr bind 2
may be used to select the device that the socket will receive packets from.
If
.Dv BDADDR_ANY
is specified then the socket will receive packets from all
devices on the system.
.Xr connect 2
may be used to create connections such that packets sent with
.Xr send 2
will be delivered to the specified device, otherwise
.Xr sendto 2
should be used.
.Pp
The
.Ar bt_psm
and
.Ar bt_channel
fields in the sockaddr_bt structure are ignored by HCI protocol code
and should be set to zero.
.Pp
HCI socket options:
.Bl -tag -width XX
.It Dv SO_HCI_EVT_FILTER Op Ar struct hci_filter
This filter controls which events will be received at the socket.
See
.Aq Pa netbt/hci.h
for available events.
By default, only Command_Complete and Command_Status
events are enabled.
.It Dv SO_HCI_PKT_FILTER Op Ar struct hci_filter
This filter controls the type of packets that will be received at the
socket.
By default, only Event packets are enabled.
.It Dv SO_HCI_DIRECTION Op Ar int
When set, this enables control messages on packets received at the socket
indicating the direction of travel of the packet.
.El
.Pp
HCI
.Xr sysctl 8
controls:
.Bl -tag -width XXX
.It Dv net.bluetooth.hci.sendspace
Default send buffer size for HCI sockets.
.It Dv net.bluetooth.hci.recvspace
Default receive buffer size for HCI sockets.
.It Dv net.bluetooth.hci.acl_expiry
If set, this is the time in seconds after which unused ACL data connections
will be expired.
If zero, connections will not be closed.
.It Dv net.bluetooth.hci.memo_expiry
Time, in seconds, that the system will keep records of Bluetooth devices
in the vicinity after an Inquiry Response packet has been received.
This information is used for routing purposes.
.It Dv net.bluetooth.hci.eventq_max
The maximum number of packets on the low level Event queue.
.It Dv net.bluetooth.hci.aclrxq_max
The maximum number of packets on the low level ACL queue.
.It Dv net.bluetooth.hci.scorxq_max
The maximum number of packets on the low level SCO queue.
.El
.It Cm BTPROTO_L2CAP
L2CAP sockets give sequential packet access over channels to other Bluetooth
devices and make use of the
.Ar bt_psm
field in the
.Ar sockaddr_bt
structure to select the Protocol/Service Multiplexer to specify when making
connections.
.Pp
L2CAP socket options:
.Bl -tag -width XXX
.It Dv SO_L2CAP_IMTU Op Ar uint16_t
Incoming MTU.
.It Dv SO_L2CAP_OMTU Op Ar uint16_t

.It Dv L2CAP_LM_ENCRYPT
Request encryption
.Pq includes auth .
.It Dv L2CAP_LM_SECURE
Request secured link
.Pq encryption, plus change link key .
.El
.Pp
Link mode settings will be applied to the baseband link during L2CAP
connection establishment.
If the L2CAP connection is already established,
.Dv EINPROGRESS
may be returned, and it is not possible to guarantee that data already queued
.Pq from either end
will not be delivered.
If the mode change fails, the L2CAP connection will be aborted.
.El
.Pp

.It Dv net.bluetooth.l2cap.ertx
Extended Response Timeout eXpiry for L2CAP signals.
.El
.It Cm BTPROTO_RFCOMM
RFCOMM sockets provide streamed data over Bluetooth connections
and make use of the
.Ar bt_psm
and
.Ar bt_channel
fields in the
.Ar sockaddr_bt
structure.
The channel number must be between 1 and 30 inclusive.
If no PSM is specified, a default value of
.Dv L2CAP_PSM_RFCOMM
(0x0003) will be used.
.Pp

.El
.Pp
Link mode settings will be applied to the baseband link during RFCOMM
connection establishment.
If the RFCOMM connection is already established,
.Dv EINPROGRESS
may be returned, and it is not possible to guarantee that data already queued
.Pq from either end
will not be delivered.
If the mode change fails, the RFCOMM connection will be aborted.
.El
.Pp
RFCOMM

channels over Bluetooth connections, typically used for audio data.
.Pp
SCO socket options:
.Bl -tag -width XXX
.It Dv SO_SCO_MTU Op Ar uint16_t
Maximum packet size for use on this link.
This is read-only and will be set by the protocol code when a connection is made.
Currently, due to limitations in the
.Xr ubt 4
driver, the SCO protocol code will only accept packets with
exactly this size.
.It Dv SO_SCO_HANDLE Op Ar uint16_t
Connection handle for this link.
This is read-only and provided for informational purposes only.
.El
.Pp
