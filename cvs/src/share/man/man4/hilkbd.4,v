.Dt HILKBD 4
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm hilkbd
.Nd HIL keyboard device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "hilkbd* at hil?"
.Cd "wskbd* at hilkbd?"
.Cd "option HILKBD_LAYOUT=XXX"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This driver supports HIL keyboards within the
.Xr wscons 4
framework.
It doesn't provide direct device driver entry points, but makes its
functions available through the internal
.Xr wskbd 4
interface.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports a number of different key mappings.
By default, the layout corresponding to the keyboard model as probed
by the
.Nm
driver will be used.
A different layout can be chosen either with the kernel option
.Dq HILKBD_LAYOUT
at compile time, or with the
.Xr wsconsctl 8
utility (variable:
.Dq keyboard.encoding )
at runtime.
.Pp
The supported key mappings are at this time:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent -compact
.It KB_DE
.Pq de
German with
.Dq dead accents .
.It KB_FR
.Pq fr
French with
.Dq dead accents .
.It KB_SV
.Pq sv
Swedish.
.It KB_UK
.Pq uk
British.
.It KB_US
.Pq us
English/US keyboard mapping.
.El
.Pp
The KB_DE mapping can be used in the KB_NODEAD
.Pq .nodead
variant.
This switches off the
.Dq dead accents .
.Sh EXAMPLES
To set a Swedish keyboard mapping, use
.Ic wsconsctl keyboard.encoding=sv .
To set it at kernel build time, regardless of what keyboard is plugged, add
the following to the kernel configuration file:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
option HILKBD_LAYOUT="KB_SV"
.Ed
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr hil 4 ,
.Xr intro 4 ,
.Xr wskbd 4 ,
.Xr wsconsctl 8
.Sh BUGS
The list of built-in mappings is incomplete and has grown as people submitted
information about their particular layout.
.Pp
The Swedish and British layout have been reconstructed from tables in the old
HIL code present in the hp300 port, and have not been tested.
