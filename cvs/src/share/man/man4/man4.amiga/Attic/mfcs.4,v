@amiga and sun3 turned out to not be y2k+3 compliant here. Remove them, as

serial communications interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "mfc0 at mainbus0"
.Cd "mfcs0 at mfc0 unit 0"
.Cd "mfcs1 at mfc0 unit 1"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Tn MultiFaceCard II/III
controls, among other things, a dual port
.Tn EIA
.Tn RS-232C
.Pf ( Tn CCITT
.Tn V.28 )
communications interface with a multiple character buffer.
.Pp
Input and output for each MultiFaceCard III line may set to a maximum baud
rates of 1152000.
Formula for baud rate:  Baud = 230400 / N with 1 < N < 65536.
.Pp
Input and output for each MultiFaceCard II line may set to a maximum baud
rates of 57600.
Formula for baud rate:  Baud = 115200 / N with 1 < N < 65536.

.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It mfcs0: fifo overflow.
The four-character input
.Dq fifo
has overflowed and incoming data has been lost.
.It mfcs0: %d buffer overflows.
The software based input ring buffer
has overflowed %d times and incoming data has been lost.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr tty 4
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Tn Amiga
.Nm
device first appeared in
.Nx 1.0a
.Sh BUGS
The MultiFaceCard II/III serial ports use the level 6 interrupt and may
experience fifo overflows if the LEV6_DEFER option is used.
