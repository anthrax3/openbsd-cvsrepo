.Sh NAME
.Nm bah
.Nd ARCnet driver for SMC COM90C26 based boards
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "bah* at zbus0"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
interface provides access to the 2.5 Mb/s ARCnet network via the
.Tn SMC
COM90C26
ARCnet chip set.
.Pp
Each of the host's network addresses
is specified at boot time with an
.Dv SIOCSIFADDR
.Xr ioctl 2 .
The
.Nm
interface does not employ the address resolution protocol described in
.Xr arp 4
to dynamically map between Internet and Ethernet addresses on the local
network.
Instead, it uses the least significant 8 bits of the IP address as hardware
address, as described in
.Em RFC 1051
and
.Em RFC 1201
as one option.
.Pp
With the IFF_LINK0 flag cleared, IP encoding is done according to the
deprecated, but popular among Amiga users, RFC 1051 encoding (that
is, with simple header, packet type 240), and the MTU is 507.
.Pp
With the IFF_LINK0 flag set, IP encoding is done according to RFC 1201 (that
is, with Packet Header Definition Standard header and packet type 212).
The MTU is normally 1500.
.Pp
When switching between the two modes, do a
.Cd ifconfig interfacename down up
to switch the mtu.
.Sh HARDWARE
The
.Nm
interface supports the following Zorro II expansion cards:
.Bl -tag -width "AMERISTAR" -offset indent
.It Em A2060
Commodore's arcnet card, manufacturer\ 514, product\ 9
.It Em AMERISTAR
Ameristar's arcnet card, manufacturer\ 1053, product\ 9
.El

.Xr intro 4 ,
.Xr ifconfig 8 ,
.Xr RFC1051 ,
.Xr RFC1201
.Pp
ARCnet Packet Header Definition Standard, Novell Inc., 1989
.Sh STANDARDS
RFC 1051 / RFC1201 without ARP, using direct mapping of lower 8 IP
address bits instead.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Tn Amiga
.Nm
interface first appeared in
.Nx 1.0a

@- remove all trailing whitespace
     * except when it is escaped with a `\' at the end of the line
- fix remaining .Nm usage as well
- this is from a patch I received from kwesterback@@home.com, who has been
  working on some scripts for fixing formatting errors in mdoc'd man pages

Ok, so there could be a cost/benefit debate with this commit, but since I have
the patch we might as well commit it...

@The proper order of the ``introductory'' macros in a man page is .Dd/.Dt/.Os.
Out of the approximately 1450 man pages, only about 90 of them were wrong.
Thanks to kwesterback@@home.com for coming up with a script and patch to repair
this. The patch also inserted a .Os macro in the few man pages that were
missing one.
