.Sh NAME
.Nm atzsc
.Nd A2091 low level SCSI interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "atzsc0 at zbus0"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Tn Amiga
architecture uses a common machine independent scsi sub-system
provided in the kernel source.
The machine independent drivers that use this code access the hardware
through a common interface.
(see
.Xr scsibus 4 )
This common interface interacts with a machine dependent interface,
such as
.Nm atzsc ,
which then handles the hardware specific issues.
.Pp
The
.Nm
interface handles things such as DMA and interrupts as well as
actually sending commands, negotiating synchronous or asynchronous
transfers and handling disconnect/reconnect of SCSI targets.
The hardware that
.Nm
uses is based on the WD33c93 SCSI chip.
.Sh HARDWARE
The
.Nm
interface supports the following Zorro II expansion cards:
.Bl -tag -width "A2091" -offset indent
.It Em A2091
Commodore SCSI adapter, manufacturer\ 514, product\ 2 or product\ 3
.El
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It sbicwait TIMEO @@%d with asr=x%x csr=x%x
The 33c93 code (sbic) has been waiting too long for a SCSI chip
operation to complete.
%d is the line in the source file
.Pa amiga/dev/sbic.c
at which the SCSI chip timed-out.
Asr and csr are status registers withing the SCSI chip.
.It atzsc%d: abort %s: csr = 0x%02x, asr = 0x%02x
A SCSI operation %s was aborted due to an error.
.It atzsc%d: csr == 0x%02i
An error has occurred within the SCSI chip code.
.It atzsc%d: unexpected phase %d in icmd from %d
The target described by
.Sq from %d
has taken the SCSI bus into a phase which is not
expected durring polled IO.
.It atzsc%d: unexpected phase %d in icmd from %d
The target described by
.Sq from %d
has taken the SCSI bus into a phase which is not
expected durring DMA IO setup.
.El

The
.Nm
interface first appeared in
.Nx 0.9a

@- remove all trailing whitespace
     * except when it is escaped with a `\' at the end of the line
- fix remaining .Nm usage as well
- this is from a patch I received from kwesterback@@home.com, who has been
  working on some scripts for fixing formatting errors in mdoc'd man pages

Ok, so there could be a cost/benefit debate with this commit, but since I have
the patch we might as well commit it...

@The proper order of the ``introductory'' macros in a man page is .Dd/.Dt/.Os.
Out of the approximately 1450 man pages, only about 90 of them were wrong.
Thanks to kwesterback@@home.com for coming up with a script and patch to repair
this. The patch also inserted a .Os macro in the few man pages that were
missing one.
