@amiga and sun3 turned out to not be y2k+3 compliant here. Remove them, as
well as the few userland tools which were only used on these platforms.

.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm autoconf
.Nd diagnostics from the autoconfiguration code
.Sh DESCRIPTION
When
.Ox
bootstraps it probes the innards of the machine
on which it is running
and locates controllers, drives, and other devices, printing out
what it finds on the console.
This procedure is driven by a system configuration table which is processed by
.Xr config 8
and compiled into each kernel.
Devices which exist in the machine but are not configured into the
kernel are not detected.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr intro 4 ,
.Xr boot_amiga 8 ,
.Xr config 8

log
@autoconf(4) cleanup:
- remove blatant lies (missing diagnostics, unconfigured devices never
detected even on pci or such busses...)
- .Tn UNIX -> .Ox
- xref boot_`arch`(8) rather than boot(8) when boot(8) does not exist
- vague attempt to harmonize common texts

An Amiga internal device

If this line follows the

indicates that a second floppy drive was detected, but was not configured
into the kernel.
.Pp
.It zbus0 at mainbus0 [mem 0x%x-0x%x].
The kernel is configuring AutoConfigured expansion boards.
If any Zorro II memory was detected, the virtual address of the space
reserved for DMA bounce buffers is printed.
.Pp
.It %s at zbus0: rom 0x%x man/prod %d/%d.
A Zorro expansion board was configured.
.Ql Rom 0x%0x
is the physical address the board was configured at.
.Ql Man/prod &d/%d
is the manufacturer/product codes.
.Pp
.It %s at zbus0: rom 0x%x man/prod %d/%d not configured.
A Zorro expansion board located at

with a manufacturer/product code

was found that is not configured into the kernel.
