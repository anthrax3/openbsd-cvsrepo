.Sh NAME
.Nm ae
.Nd Ethernet driver for AMD 79C960 LANCE based boards
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "ae* at zbus0"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
interface provides access to the 10 Mb/s Ethernet network via the
.Tn AMD
79C960
.Tn LANCE
Ethernet chip set.
.Pp
Each of the host's network addresses
is specified at boot time with an
.Dv SIOCSIFADDR
.Xr ioctl 2 .
The
.Nm
interface employs the address resolution protocol described in
.Xr arp 4
to dynamically map between Internet and Ethernet addresses on the local
network.
.Pp
This card come with two different assortment of connectors:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
.It 10Base2
BNC, also known as thin-net
.It 10BaseT
UTP, also known as twisted pair
.El
.Pp
The card uses an autoselect between UTP and BNC, so it uses UTP when an
active UTP line is connected or otherwise BNC.
To choose an alternate port, use the following flag combinations with
.Xr ifconfig 8
or in your /etc/hostname.ae? file.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
.It -link0
Use the autoselect between UTP and BNC (default).
.It \ link0 -link1
Use the BNC port.
.It \ link0 \ link1
Use the UTP port.
.El
.Sh HARDWARE
The
.Nm
interface supports the following Zorro II expansion cards:
.Bl -tag -width "ARIADNE" -offset indent
.It Em ARIADNE
Village Tronic's ethernet card, manufacturer\ 2167, product\ 201
.El
.Sh NOTES
Multicasting needs to be tested.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
interface first appeared in
.Nx 1.0a
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr arp 4 ,
.Xr inet 4 ,
.Xr intro 4 ,
.Xr ifconfig 8

@- remove all trailing whitespace
     * except when it is escaped with a `\' at the end of the line
- fix remaining .Nm usage as well
- this is from a patch I received from kwesterback@@home.com, who has been
  working on some scripts for fixing formatting errors in mdoc'd man pages

Ok, so there could be a cost/benefit debate with this commit, but since I have
the patch we might as well commit it...

@The proper order of the ``introductory'' macros in a man page is .Dd/.Dt/.Os.
Out of the approximately 1450 man pages, only about 90 of them were wrong.
Thanks to kwesterback@@home.com for coming up with a script and patch to repair
this. The patch also inserted a .Os macro in the few man pages that were
missing one.
