.Sh NAME
.Nm jmb
.Nd JMicron JMB36x SATA II and PATA Host Controller
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "jmb* at pci?"
.Cd "ahci* at jmb?"
.Cd "pciide* at jmb?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
JMicron JMB36x hardware can provide support for SATA devices using the Advanced
Host Controller Interface for Serial ATA, and for PATA devices using PCI IDE
controller specification.
Since support for both SATA and PATA devices can be enabled on the same PCI
device but only one driver per PCI device can be attached, the
.Nm
driver acts as a nexus to other drivers that support the SATA and PATA
functionality.
.Xr ahci 4
supports the SATA functionality, and
.Xr pciide 4
support the PATA functionality on these controllers.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr ahci 4 ,
.Xr intro 4 ,
.Xr pci 4 ,
.Xr pciide 4
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver first appeared in
.Ox 4.2 .
.Sh AUTHORS

The
.Nm
driver was written by
