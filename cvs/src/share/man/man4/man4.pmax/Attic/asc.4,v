.Sh NAME
.Nm asc
.Nd
TurboChannel SCSI adaptor
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "asc? at ioasic?"
.Cd "asc? at tc?"
.Cd "oldscsibus* at asc?"
.Cd "scsibus* at asc?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the NCR 53c94-based scsi host adaptor
on the DECstation 5000 series, and for the PMAZ-AA and related
TurboChannel SCSI-adaptor option boards.
The
.Nm
is a medium-performance implementation of the SCSI-I common set
supporting synchronous and asynchronous SCSI devices.  The driver
provides no support for targets with multiple logical unit numbers
(LUNs).
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr cd 4 ,
.Xr ch 4 ,
.Xr intro 4 ,
.Xr rz 4 ,
.Xr sd 4 ,
.Xr st 4 ,
.Xr tz 4
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver first appeared in
.Bx 4.4 .
.Sh BUGS
The
.Nm
driver only supports the
.Nm oldscsibus
higher-level layer, and the
.Nm rz
and
.Nm tz
devices, which first appeared in
.Bx 4.4 /pmax.
It should be  re-written to support the
.Nm scsibus
machine-independent higher-level SCSI layer and the
.Nm sd ,
.Nm st ,
and
.Nm cd
drivers. This is
.Ud .

@- remove all trailing whitespace
     * except when it is escaped with a `\' at the end of the line
- fix remaining .Nm usage as well
- this is from a patch I received from kwesterback@@home.com, who has been
  working on some scripts for fixing formatting errors in mdoc'd man pages

Ok, so there could be a cost/benefit debate with this commit, but since I have
the patch we might as well commit it...

@Cleanup xrefs under SEE ALSO.  Specifically:

  - Sort xrefs by section, and then alphabetically.
  - Add missing commas between xref items.
  - Remove commas from the last xref entry.
  - Remove duplicate entries.
