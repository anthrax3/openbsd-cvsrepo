.Sh NAME
.Nm px
.Nd
TurboChannel PMAG-C   2-D accelerated graphics board
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "px* at tc?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides minimal support for a
.Tn DEC
.Tn PMAG-C
video display option card.
The
.Nm
driver does nothing except remove the requirement to remove
.Tn PMAG-C
cards in order to boot
.Nx .
It offers no support for either raster consoles
or X11 servers.
To do either requires using the undocumented packet
protocol used to talk to the on-board blitter chip.
.Pp
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr rcons 4 ,
.Xr tc 4 ,
.Xr ws 4 .
.Sh BUGS
Console output support and X11 server support should be implemented.
They are not.
.Pp
The
.Nm rcons
glass-tty raster framebuffer console driver assumes
direct bit read/write access to a framebuffer. The
.Nm
hardware does not provide this.
.Nm rcons
should be replaced with a driver that allows a character-painting
interface as well as direct blitting.
.Pp
The only known X
server is an Ultrix binary which requires emulation of the Ultrix Xws
ABI. Work on this is in progress.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver
first appeared in
.Nx 1.3 .

log
@- remove all trailing whitespace
     * except when it is escaped with a `\' at the end of the line
- fix remaining .Nm usage as well
- this is from a patch I received from kwesterback@@home.com, who has been
  working on some scripts for fixing formatting errors in mdoc'd man pages

Ok, so there could be a cost/benefit debate with this commit, but since I have
the patch we might as well commit it...
