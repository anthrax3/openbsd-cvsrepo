.Sh NAME
.Nm sii
.Nd
SII scsi adaptor
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "sii0 at mainbus"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the
.Tn DEC
SII scsi adaptor ASIC used in
the DECstation 2100, 3100, and 5100,  and in the VAXstation 3100.
.Pp
The
.Nm
is a medium-performance implementation of the SCSI-I common set
supporting synchronous and asynchronous SCSI devices.  The SII cabling
is unusual:  the bulkhead connector is very similar to a standard
submicro wide SCSI-II connector, but has the other gender.
The
.Nm
chip only supports DMA to or from a fixed window in memory.
The driver use this area as a bounce buffer,  copying data to and
from the  DMA region.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr cd 4 ,
.Xr ch 4 ,
.Xr intro 4 ,
.Xr rz 4 ,
.Xr sd 4 ,
.Xr st 4 ,
.Xr tz 4
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver
first appeared in
.Bx 4.4 .
.Sh BUGS
The
.Nm
driver only supports the
.Nm oldscsibus
higher-level layer, and the
.Nm rz
and
.Nm tz
devices, which first appeared in
.Bx 4.4 /pmax.
It should be  re-written to support the
.Nm scsibus
machine-independent higher-level SCSI layer and the
.Nm sd ,
.Nm st ,
and
.Nm cd
drivers. This is
.Ud .

@- remove all trailing whitespace
     * except when it is escaped with a `\' at the end of the line
- fix remaining .Nm usage as well
- this is from a patch I received from kwesterback@@home.com, who has been
  working on some scripts for fixing formatting errors in mdoc'd man pages

Ok, so there could be a cost/benefit debate with this commit, but since I have
the patch we might as well commit it...

@Cleanup xrefs under SEE ALSO.  Specifically:

  - Sort xrefs by section, and then alphabetically.
  - Add missing commas between xref items.
  - Remove commas from the last xref entry.
  - Remove duplicate entries.
