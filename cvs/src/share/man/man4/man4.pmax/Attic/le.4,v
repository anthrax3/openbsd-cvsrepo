.Sh NAME
.Nm le
.Nd
DECstation AMD 7990 LANCE ethernet interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "le? at mainbus	with le_pmax"		(3100 baseboard)
.Cd "le*? at tc	with le_tc"		(5000/200 baseboard)
.Cd "le? at ioasic  with le_ioasic"	(ioasic baseboard)
.Cd "le* at tc?	with le_tc"		(TC option cards)
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides access to a 10Mb/s Ethernet via the
.Tn AMD
7990
.Tn LANCE
Ethernet chip.  All
.Tn LANCE
interfaces on
.Tn DECstations
are supported, as are interfaces on
.Tn "Alpha AXP"
machines with a
.Tn TurboChannel
bus.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver employs the Address Resolution Protocol described in
.Xr arp 4
to map between Internet and Ethernet addresses on the local
network.  Selective reception of multicast Ethernet frames is provided
by a 64-bit mask; multicast destination addresses are hashed to a
bit entry using the Ethernet CRC function.
.Pp
No support is provided for switching between media ports.  The
DECstation 3100 provides both AUI and BNC  (thinwire or 10base2) connectors.
Port selection is via a manual switch and is not software configurable.
The
.Tn DECstation
model 5000/200
.Tn PMAD-AA
baseboard device provides only a BNC connector.
The
.Nm ioasic
baseboard devices and  the
.Tn PMAD-AA
.Tn TurboChannel
option card provide only an AUI port.
.Pp
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr arp 4 ,
.Xr inet 4 ,
.Xr intro 4 ,
.Xr ioasic 4 ,
.Xr tc 4
.Sh BUGS
On all front-ends, performance is impaired by hardware which forces
a software copy of packets to and from DMA buffers.  The
.Nm ioasic
machines  and the DECstation 3100 must
copying packet to and from non-contiguous DMA buffers.
The
DECstation 5000/200  and the
.Tn PMAD-AA
must copy to and from an onboard SRAM DMA
buffer.  The CPU overhead is noticeable, but all machines can sustain
10Mbit media speed.
.Sh HISTORY
This
.Nm
driver is derived from a
.NM
driver that first appeared in
.Bx 4.4 .
Support for  multiple bus attachments first appeared in
.Nx 1.2 .

@- remove all trailing whitespace
     * except when it is escaped with a `\' at the end of the line
- fix remaining .Nm usage as well
- this is from a patch I received from kwesterback@@home.com, who has been
  working on some scripts for fixing formatting errors in mdoc'd man pages

Ok, so there could be a cost/benefit debate with this commit, but since I have
the patch we might as well commit it...

@Cleanup xrefs under SEE ALSO.  Specifically:

  - Sort xrefs by section, and then alphabetically.
  - Add missing commas between xref items.
  - Remove commas from the last xref entry.
  - Remove duplicate entries.
