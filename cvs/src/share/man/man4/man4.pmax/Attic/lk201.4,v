.Sh NAME
.Nm lk201
.Nd
LK-201 keyboard input driver
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the
.Tn Digital
.Tn LK-201
keyboard and successors.   This support is automatically configured
into the kernel, to map input keypress events into ACSII codes.
There is no way to disable this support.
.Pp
The kernel also includes support for an in-kernel ring-buffer
structure for keypress events and pointer (mouse) events.  The
.Nm fb
driver redirects mouse and keyboard input into this in-kernel
structure, and updates the position of a framebuffer cursor sprite to
track the mouse.  This is for compatibility with the
.Nm qv
QVSS-style software interface used by X11 on  DECstation and Vaxstation
framebuffers.   This design offers significantly better performance
on the Vaxstation-100 and Vaxstation-II, but makes it impossible
to use alternative pointer or keyboard devices.
.Sh BUGS
The
.Nm
support should be re-written as a real driver or as a pseudo-device driver.
The
.Nm
driver should use an in-kernel streams facility, if one existed.

@- remove all trailing whitespace
     * except when it is escaped with a `\' at the end of the line
- fix remaining .Nm usage as well
- this is from a patch I received from kwesterback@@home.com, who has been
  working on some scripts for fixing formatting errors in mdoc'd man pages

Ok, so there could be a cost/benefit debate with this commit, but since I have
the patch we might as well commit it...
