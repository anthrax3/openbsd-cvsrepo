.Nm amdpm
.Nd AMD-756/766/768/8111 Power Management and SMBus controller
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "amdpm* at pci?"
.Cd "iic* at amdpm?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the
AMD-756/766/768/8111 Power Management controller.
.Pp
The RNG function of the AMD-768/8111 Power Management controller
is supported.
Data generated by the RNG get fed into the pool of the
.Xr random 4
device.
.Pp
The SMBus host interface of the AMD-756/766/768/8111 Power Management controller
and NVIDIA nForce 1 chipset are also supported.
The SMBus host interface can be used with the
.Xr iic 4
framework.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr iic 4 ,
.Xr intro 4 ,
.Xr pci 4 ,
.Xr random 4
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
device driver appeared in
.Ox 3.2 .
SMBus host interface support was added in
.Ox 3.9 .

@Incomplete section 4 mi manual page cleanup.
- make configuration lines match GENERIC files
- more Xr (hopefully usefule Xr)
- never mention intro(4) on non-physical devices (i.e. protocols), always
mention it for physical devices
- random text style and quoting fixes
- drivers ported from FreeBSD did mention rc.conf instead of hostname.if as
the place to put mediaopt
- some .Tn UNIX -> .Ox replacements
- etc, etc...
