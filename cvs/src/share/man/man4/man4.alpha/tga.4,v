.Nd DECchip 21030 (TGA) graphics driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "tga* at pci?"
.Cd "wsdisplay* at tga?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This driver handles DECchip 21030 (TGA) graphics hardware within the
.Xr wscons 4
console framework.
.Pp
On TGA adapters, the resolution is set on the card and is not changed
at runtime.
On some TGA models, there are four DIP switches.
On other models, there is a rotary switch with positions 0-F.
There are also some that use jumpers.

.It Li B Ta 32 Ta 640x480 Ta 72
.It Li C Ta 25 Ta 640x480 Ta 60
.El
.Pp
The settings for D, E, and F are for 1600x1200 on some cards, but
there are no guarantees.
.Pp
There are also a couple of extra jumpers on some cards.
One of these jumpers often selects the card to be the primary display.
Exactly one of the cards in your machine should have that jumper on.
If you have extra cards, they should have the jumper off.

@make -column lists pretty again;

specifically, rewrite them to permit some markup in the column headers,
and use "Ta" instead of literal tabs; mandoc does not currently match groff
100%, but a mandoc fix may be some time off, and we've gone enough releases
with poorly formatting column lists.

in some cases i have rewritten the lists as -tag, where -column made
little sense.
