.Nd DECchip 21272 and 21274 Core Logic chipset
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "tsc* at mainbus?"
.Cd "tsciic* at tsc?"
.Cd "tsp* at tsc?"
.Cd "pci* at tsp?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the DECchip 21272 (Tsunami) and
21274 (Titan) Core Logic chipsets found on most 21264-based
systems.
.Pp
The
.Nm tsp
driver attaches to it and provides support for the DECchip 21272 and 21274
built-in PCI controller.
.Pp
DECchip 21272 provides one PCI bus, while DECchip 21274 provides two distinct
PCI buses, the second one with AGP capabilities.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr intro 4 ,
.\".Xr mainbus 4 ,
.Xr pci 4 ,
.Xr tsciic 4
.Sh BUGS
The AGP capabilities of the second PCI bus of DECchip 21274 are not currently
supported.

@Support for DS15/DS25/ES45 (Titan) alpha models (rpb family 38). These systems
are very close to the Tsunami systems (rpb family 34) and share the existing
Tsunami code; the tsc(4) Tsunami controller code is extended to handle the
Titan differences, except for the Titan AGP GART which is left unsupported
for now.

Tested to not cause regressions on DS20 (deraadt@@) and ES40 (miod@@).
Titan support tested by Sergey Prysiazhnyi on DS25, many thanks for your time!

@First pass at removing clauses 3 and 4 from NetBSD licenses.

Not sure what's more surprising: how long it took for NetBSD to
catch up to the rest of the BSDs (including UCB), or the amount of
code that NetBSD has claimed for itself without attributing to the
actual authors.

OK deraadt@@
