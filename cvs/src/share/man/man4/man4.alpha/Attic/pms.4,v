.Sh NAME

.Nd PS/2 auxiliary port mouse driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "pms0 at pcppi?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This driver provides an interface to a PS/2 auxiliary port mice.
The driver offers two modes of operation, both a raw and the old style
translated input stream.
The translating portion of the driver provides BusMouse codes;
in raw mode no translations are performed.
The
.Nm
driver provides three
.Em ioctls
for getting mouse status and changing modes.
They are defined in the following include:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
#include <machine/mouse.h>
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Dv MOUSEIOCREAD
.Em ioctl
is used to read the current mouse stats, and takes the
.Dv "struct mouseinfo"
as an argument to store the data in.
.Pp
The
.Dv MOUSEIOCSRAW
.Em ioctl
puts the device into raw mode, if it is not already, and the
.Dv MOUSEIOCSCOOKED
.Em ioctl
puts it into translated (or cooked) mode.
If the mode of the
.Nm
device driver changes, all pending but not yet read input is flushed.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width Pa -compact
.It Pa /dev/psm0
PS/2 mouse device file, defaulting to raw mode
.It Pa /dev/pms0
PS/2 mouse device file, defaulting to translating mode
