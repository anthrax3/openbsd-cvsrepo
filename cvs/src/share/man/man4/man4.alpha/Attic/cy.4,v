.Nd Cyclades Cyclom-{4, 8, 16}Y asynchronous comms board device driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "cy0 at isa? tty irq 10 iomem 0xdc000 iosiz 8192 vector cyintr"
.Cd "cy1 at pci?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This driver provides an interface to Cyclades Cyclom-4Y, Cyclom-8Y and
Cyclom-16Y asynchronous multiport serial boards.
These boards are based around Cirrus Logic CD1400 communication controllers.
.Pp
The device minor numbers for this driver are encoded as follows:
.Pp
.Bd -literal
    c c x x u u u u	- bits in the minor device number

    bits    meaning
    ----    -------
    uuuu    physical serial line (i.e. unit) to use
		0-7 on a cyclom-8Y, 0-15 on a cyclom-16Y

    xx      unused

    cc      carrier control mode
		00      complete hardware carrier control of the tty.
			DCD must be high for the open(2) to complete.
		01	reserved
		10      carrier ignored until a high->low transition
		11      carrier completed ignored
.Ed
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "cy%d: tty input queue overflow"
Incoming characters have been discarded due to a buffer overflow.
This is caused by the process in control of the device not reading characters
fast enough.
.It "cy%d: receive fifo overrun"
Incoming characters have been discarded due to a CD1400 channel overrun.
This is caused by interrupts not being serviced sufficiently quickly to prevent
the 12 byte receive FIFO on a serial channel from overflowing.
Reducing the value of the \fIRxFifoThreshold\fR #define from 8 to something 
smaller may help slow machines avoid this problem.
The driver must have been compiled with the \fILogOverruns\fR option defined
(the default) in order for this condition to be logged.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr com 4 ,
.Xr termios 4 ,
.Xr tty 4
.Sh AUTHORS
The driver was written by Andrew Herbert <andrew@@werple.apana.org.au>, and
is still under development (from time to time :-).
.Sh HISTORY
Some ideas for the architecture of this driver's two-layer processing model
were derived from the fas 2.10 driver by Uwe Doering
<gemini@@geminix.in-berlin.de> and the high-performance com driver by Bruce
Evans <bde@@kralizec.zeta.org.au>.
.Pp
This work was made possible through the donation of a Cyclom-8Y board by the
manufacturer, Cyclades Corporation.
However, neither Cyclades nor the author make any warranties regarding this
software, nor guarantees of support.
.Sh BUGS
There is currently no BREAK handling - breaks are ignored.
There is no support for bad-character reporting, except via PARMRK.
The Cyclom-[48]Y boards do not listen to the RTS signal for receiver flow
control.
FIFO overruns are only logged when the termios IGNPAR setting is enabled.

@The proper order of the ``introductory'' macros in a man page is .Dd/.Dt/.Os.
Out of the approximately 1450 man pages, only about 90 of them were wrong.
Thanks to kwesterback@@home.com for coming up with a script and patch to repair
this. The patch also inserted a .Os macro in the few man pages that were
missing one.
