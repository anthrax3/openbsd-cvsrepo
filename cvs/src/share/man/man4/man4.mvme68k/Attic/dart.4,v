@Retire hp300, mvme68k and mvme88k ports. These ports have no users, keeping
this hardware alive is becoming increasingly difficult, and I should heed the
message sent by the three disks which have died on me over the last few days.

Noone sane will mourn these ports anyway. So long, and thanks for the fish.

.Sh NAME
.Nm dart
.Nd MC68681 or MC68692 dual UART
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "dart0 at ofobio0 offset 0x20000 ipl 5" Pq MVME141
.Cd "dart0 at lrc0    offset 0x40000 ipl 5" Pq MVME165
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The MC68681 and MC68692 dual asynchronous receiver/transmitter
.Pq Tn DUART
component provides two serial ports, as well as a 16-bit programmable
counter/timer.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the two serial ports found onboard
MVME141 and MVME165 systems.
.Pp
The
.Nm
serial ports have a two character buffer on the transmit path, and a four
character buffer on the receive path.
.Pp
The following link speeds are supported by the
.Nm
driver:
75, 110, 134.5, 150, 300, 600, 1200, 1800, 2400, 4800, 9600 and 19200 bps.
.Pp
On MVME141, the counter/timer is used to provide the
scheduling clock.
