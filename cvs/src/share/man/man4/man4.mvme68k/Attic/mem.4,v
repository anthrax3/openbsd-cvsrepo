@Retire hp300, mvme68k and mvme88k ports. These ports have no users, keeping
this hardware alive is becoming increasingly difficult, and I should heed the
message sent by the three disks which have died on me over the last few days.

Noone sane will mourn these ports anyway. So long, and thanks for the fish.

.Sh NAME

.Nd memory files
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The file
.Pa /dev/mem
is an interface to the physical memory of the
computer.
Byte offsets in this file are interpreted as physical memory addresses.
Reading and writing this file is equivalent to reading and writing
memory itself.
An error will be returned if an attempt is made to reference
an offset outside of
.Pa /dev/mem .
.Pp
Kernel virtual memory is accessed via the file
.Pa /dev/kmem
in the same manner as
.Pa /dev/mem .
Only kernel virtual addresses that are currently mapped to memory are allowed.
.Pp
On the mvme68k,
physical memory is always contiguous;
kernel virtual memory begins at
.Ad 0x00000000 .
.Pp
Writeability of these devices is controlled by the system
.Xr securelevel 7 .

@Last minute cleaning:
- add autoconf(4) boring template
- remove console(4) obviously stolen from hp300 and thus full of lies
(graphics console? on mvme68k? hello?)
- .Xr and .Cd police
- intro(4) nutrition
- mvme68k is not a .Tn as far as I know
