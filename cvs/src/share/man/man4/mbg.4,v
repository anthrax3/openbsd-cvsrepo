.Nm mbg
.Nd Meinberg Funkuhren timedelta sensor
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "mbg* at pci?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for Meinberg Funkuhren radio clocks (time signal
station and GPS receivers).
.Nm
implements a timedelta sensor and the delta (in nanoseconds) between the
received time information and the local time can be accessed through the
.Xr sysctl 8
interface.
.Pp
The card type is indicated in the sensor description.
Currently, the following cards are supported by
.Nm :
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "GPS170XXX" -offset indent -compact
.It GPS170PCI
3.3V/5V 6-channel GPS receiver card
.It PCI32
5V DCF77 time signal station receiver card
.It PCI509
5V DCF77 time signal station receiver card
.It PCI511
3.3V/5V DCF77 time signal station receiver card
.It PEX511
PCI Express DCF77 time signal station receiver card
.El
.Pp
The quality of the timedelta is reported as the sensor status:
.Bl -tag -width "CRITICALXX" -offset indent
.It UNKNOWN
No valid time information has been received yet.
.It OK
The time information is valid and the timedelta is safe to use for
applications like
.Xr ntpd 8 .
.It WARN
The time information is still valid, but no new time information has been
decoded for twelve hours (four days in the case of a GPS170PCI card) due to
a reception or parity error.
The timedelta should be used with care.
.It CRITICAL
No valid time information has been received for more than twelve hours (or
four days in the case of a GPS170PCI card) since the sensor state degraded
from OK to WARN.
This is an indication that hardware should be checked to see if it is still
functional.
.El
.Pp
A second sensor provides the relative signal quality as a percentage.
The status of this sensor is used to report the status of the device itself:
.Bl -tag -width "CRITICALXX" -offset indent
.It OK
The clock is synchronized.
.It WARN
The device's clock is free running on the local oscillator.
For DCF77 receiver cards this is not an error and can happen due to the
nature of the signal transmission using longwave radio.
.It CRITICAL
Hardware failure, e.g. communication with the device failed.

@mbg(4), a driver for Meinberg Funkuhren time signal station receivers
"Made in Switzerland"

Currently, the DCF77 PCI32 receiver card is supported

I have to mention the outstanding support from Meinberg, not only did they
give me the hardware, docs, and reference source code, but they even call
me back to explain the details of their hardware to me.  If only the wireless
manufacturors were that cooperative...
