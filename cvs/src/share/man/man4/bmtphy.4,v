.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm bmtphy
.Nd Broadcom Mini-Theta Ethernet PHY
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "bmtphy* at mii?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver supports the Broadcom Mini-Theta BCM5201 and BCM5202 10/100
Ethernet PHYs and their derivatives such as BCM4401, BCM5214, and BCM522x.
It also supports the internal PHY on the 3Com 3C905C-TX 10/100 Ethernet
interface, and the internal PHY on some 3Com 3C905B-TX 10/100 Ethernet
interfaces.
These PHYs are found on a variety of high-performance Ethernet interfaces.
