with
.Dv SIGUSR2
and
.Dv SIGINT

.Nm
will log notifications that the guest has been suspended or resumed by the
host.
It also provides access to the host machine's clock as a timedelta sensor.
.Pp
.Nm
reports the guest's hostname and first non-loopback IP address to the host.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr pvbus 4 ,
.Xr init 8 ,
.Xr sensorsd 8 ,
.Xr sysctl 8
.Pp
A
.Sy vmwh
helper program is available via
.Xr packages 7 .

.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Nm
