@Retire OpenBSD/cats. Hardware is nice but prone to catch fire, and the firmware
is anything but useful. Nevertheless this was a very good platform to use as
an OpenBSD/*arm* starting point, but nowadays this platform is not necessary
anymore.

Somehow these CATS motherboard are just like AUI hubs, with the difference that,
when my AUI hub caught fire, 10base5 support was not removed from the networking
code.

.Sh NAME
.Nm autoconf
.Nd diagnostics from the autoconfiguration code
.Sh DESCRIPTION
When
.Ox
bootstraps it probes the innards of the machine
on which it is running
and locates controllers, drives, and other devices, printing out
what it finds on the console.
This procedure is driven by a system configuration table which is processed by
.Xr config 8
and compiled into each kernel.
Devices which exist in the machine but are not configured into the
kernel are usually not detected.
