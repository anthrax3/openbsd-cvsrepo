.Nd 3Com EtherLink (3C501) Ethernet device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "el0 at isa? port 0x300 irq 9"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
device driver supports 3Com EtherLink (3C501) Ethernet cards.
.Pp
For more information on configuring this device, see
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
To view a list of media types and options supported by your card try
.Dq ifconfig <device> media .
For example,
.Dq ifconfig el0 media .
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "el0: device timeout"
The device has stopped responding to the network, or there is a problem with
the network connection (cable).
.It "el0: invalid packet size N; dropping"
A packet of an invalid length (less than size of Ethernet header or greater
than maximum size of Ethernet frame) was received and dropped.

.Sh SEE ALSO

@First pass at removing clauses 3 and 4 from NetBSD licenses.

Not sure what's more surprising: how long it took for NetBSD to
catch up to the rest of the BSDs (including UCB), or the amount of
code that NetBSD has claimed for itself without attributing to the
actual authors.

@remove the maze of "other cards by this vendor are supported by so and so
driver": it is difficult to maintain, as evidenced by a mail from mike
belopuhov on tech@@, and not amazingly useful;

take out the Xrefs from SEE ALSO too;
if you want this info, `man -k' is the way to go;

log
@Incomplete section 4 mi manual page cleanup.
- make configuration lines match GENERIC files
- more Xr (hopefully usefule Xr)
- never mention intro(4) on non-physical devices (i.e. protocols), always
mention it for physical devices
- random text style and quoting fixes
- drivers ported from FreeBSD did mention rc.conf instead of hostname.if as
the place to put mediaopt
- some .Tn UNIX -> .Ox replacements
- etc, etc...
