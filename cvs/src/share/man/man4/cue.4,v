.Sh NAME
.Nm cue
.Nd CATC USB-EL1201A USB Ethernet device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "cue* at uhub?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for USB Ethernet adapters based on the Computer
Access Technology Corporation's USB-EL1202A chipset.
This includes the following adapters:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent -compact
.It Tn Belkin F5U111
.It Tn CATC Netmate
.It Tn CATC Netmate II
.It Tn SmartBridges SmartLink
.El
.Pp
The USB-EL1202A supports a 512-bit multicast hash filter, single perfect
filter entry for the station address and promiscuous mode.
Packets are
received and transmitted over separate USB bulk transfer endpoints.
.Pp
The CATC adapter supports only 10Mbps half-duplex mode, hence there are no
.Xr ifmedia 4
modes to select.
.Pp
For more information on configuring this device, see
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "cue0: watchdog timeout"
A packet was queued for transmission and a transmit command was
issued, however the device failed to acknowledge the transmission
before a timeout expired.
.It "cue0: no memory for rx list"
The driver failed to allocate an mbuf for the receiver ring.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr arp 4 ,
.Xr intro 4 ,
.Xr netintro 4 ,
.Xr usb 4 ,
.Xr hostname.if 5 ,
.Xr ifconfig 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
device driver first appeared in
.Fx 4.0 .
.Ox
support was added in
.Ox 2.7 .
.Sh AUTHORS
.An -nosplit
The
.Nm
driver was written by
.An Bill Paul Aq Mt wpaul@@ee.columbia.edu
and ported to
.Ox
by
.An Aaron Campbell Aq Mt aaron@@openbsd.org .

- intro(4) reference police
- huge usb(4) update
- follow mdoc.samples suggested man page section ordering when necessary
- add netintro(4) and hostname.if(5) xrefs to all ethernet drivers

@Incomplete section 4 mi manual page cleanup.
- make configuration lines match GENERIC files
- more Xr (hopefully usefule Xr)
- never mention intro(4) on non-physical devices (i.e. protocols), always
mention it for physical devices
- random text style and quoting fixes
- drivers ported from FreeBSD did mention rc.conf instead of hostname.if as
the place to put mediaopt
- some .Tn UNIX -> .Ox replacements
- etc, etc...
