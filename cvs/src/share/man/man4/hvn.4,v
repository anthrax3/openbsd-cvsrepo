.Sh NAME
.Nm hvn
.Nd Hyper-V networking interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "hvn* at hyperv?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for a Network Virtual Service Client (NetVSC),
a virtual networking interface that relays device requests to the Virtual
Service Provider (VSP) in the management operating system via the VMBus.
.Pp
NetVSC emulates an RNDIS 1.0 compliant device on top of a custom NVS
protocol operating over the VMBus channel ring.
.Pp
Individual networking interfaces can be renamed by issuing a
.Cm Rename-VMNetworkAdapter
PowerShell command in the management domain.
In order to enable sending and receiving of IEEE 802.1q (VLAN) frames,
the virtual port needs to be put into
.Em Trunk
mode with the
.Cm Set-VMNetworkAdapterVlan
command.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr autoconf 4 ,
.Xr hyperv 4 ,
.Xr intro 4
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver first appeared in
.Ox 6.1 .
.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Nm
driver was written by
.An Mike Belopuhov Aq Mt mikeb@@openbsd.org
based on the
.Fx
