.Sh NAME
.Nm rtii
.Nd AIMS Lab Radiotrack II FM radio device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "rtii0   at isa? port 0x30c flags 0x00"
.Cd "rtii1   at isa? port 0x20c flags 0x00"
.Cd "radio* at rtii?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the AIMS Lab Radiotrack II FM radio tuners.
.Pp
The Radiotrack II is a stereo FM tuner that can tune in the range
87.5 \- 108.0 MHz, report signal status on the current frequency, force
audio output to mono, perform hardware signal search, and has an internal
AFC.
.Pp
The card is based on the TEA5757 chip; see
.Xr radio 4
for details.
.Pp
The Radiotrack II cards take only one I/O port.
The I/O port is set by the driver to the value specified in the configuration
file and must be either 0x20c or 0x30c.
.Pp
The flags control the driver behavior.
For example, with flags 0x01 the driver will assume that there is a TEA5759
chip is used.

@Time to cleanup:
o) start new sentence on a new line;
o) wrap long lines;
o) don't use .Pp before/after .Sh, .Ss;
o) OpenBSD -> .Ox;
o) typos;
o) close .Rs;
o) use space between arguments in tag, for example:

1.5
log
@Incomplete section 4 mi manual page cleanup.
- make configuration lines match GENERIC files
- more Xr (hopefully usefule Xr)
- never mention intro(4) on non-physical devices (i.e. protocols), always
mention it for physical devices
- random text style and quoting fixes
- drivers ported from FreeBSD did mention rc.conf instead of hostname.if as
the place to put mediaopt
- some .Tn UNIX -> .Ox replacements
- etc, etc...
