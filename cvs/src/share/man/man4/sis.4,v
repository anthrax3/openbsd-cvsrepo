.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "sis* at pci?"
.Cd "icsphy* at mii?"
.Cd "nsphyter* at mii?"
.Cd "rlphy* at mii?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for PCI Ethernet adapters and embedded
controllers based on the Silicon Integrated Systems SiS 900 /
SiS 7016 Fast Ethernet controller chips, and National
Semiconductor DP83815 (MacPHYTER) / DP83816 (MacPHYTER-II) PCI
Ethernet controller chips, including the following:

MELCO LGY-PCI-TXC
.It
Netgear FA311, FA312, FA331
.It
Soekris Engineering lan1621, lan1641
.El
.Pp
The SiS 900 is a 100Mbps Ethernet MAC and MII-compliant transceiver
in a single package.
It uses a bus master DMA and a scatter/gather descriptor scheme.
The SiS 7016 is similar to the SiS 900 except that it has no internal PHY,
requiring instead an external transceiver to be attached to its MII interface.
The SiS 900 and SiS 7016 both have a 128-bit multicast hash filter
and a single perfect filter entry for the station address.
.Pp
The NS DP83815 and DP83816 are also 100Mbps Ethernet MACs
with integrated PHY.
The NatSemi chips and the SiS chips share many of the same features and
a fairly similar programming interface, and hence are supported
by the same driver.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media types:
.Bl -tag -width full-duplex
.It autoselect
Enable autoselection of the media type and options.
The user can manually override
the autoselected mode by adding media options to the
.Xr hostname.if 5
file.
.It 10baseT
Set 10Mbps operation.
The
.Ar mediaopt
option can also be used to select either
.Ar full-duplex
or
.Ar half-duplex
modes.
.It 100baseTX
Set 100Mbps (Fast Ethernet) operation.
The
.Ar mediaopt
option can also be used to select either
.Ar full-duplex
or
.Ar half-duplex
modes.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media options:
.Bl -tag -width full-duplex
.It full-duplex
Force full duplex operation.
.It half-duplex
Force half duplex operation.
.El
.Pp
For more information on configuring this device, see
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "sis0: couldn't map ports/memory"
A fatal initialization error has occurred.
.It "sis0: couldn't map interrupt"
A fatal initialization error has occurred.
.It "sis0: watchdog timeout"
The device has stopped responding to the network, or there is a problem with
the network connection (cable).
.It "sis0: no memory for rx list"
The driver failed to allocate an mbuf for the receiver ring.
.It "sis0: no memory for tx list"
The driver failed to allocate an mbuf for the transmitter ring when
allocating a pad buffer or collapsing an mbuf chain into a cluster.

.It "sis0: chip is in D3 power state -- setting to D0"
This message applies only to adapters which support power management.
Some operating systems place the controller in low power
mode when shutting down, and some PCI BIOSes fail to bring the chip
out of this state before configuring it.
The controller loses all of its PCI configuration in the D3 state, so
if the BIOS does not set it back to full power mode in time, it won't
be able to configure it correctly.
The driver tries to detect this condition and bring
the adapter back to the D0 (full power) state, but this may not be
enough to return the driver to a fully operational condition.
If this message appears at boot time and the driver fails to attach
the device as a network interface, a second warm boot will have to be
performed to have the device properly configured.
.Pp
Note that this condition only occurs when warm booting from another
operating system.
If the system is powered down prior to booting
.Ox ,
the card should be configured correctly.

@Incomplete section 4 mi manual page cleanup.
- make configuration lines match GENERIC files
- more Xr (hopefully usefule Xr)
- never mention intro(4) on non-physical devices (i.e. protocols), always
mention it for physical devices
- random text style and quoting fixes
- drivers ported from FreeBSD did mention rc.conf instead of hostname.if as
the place to put mediaopt
- some .Tn UNIX -> .Ox replacements
- etc, etc...
