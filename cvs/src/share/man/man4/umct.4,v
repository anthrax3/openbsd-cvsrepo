@Eivind Evensen reports a working device, but another reader (sorry, mail
not to hand!) reports non-working devices. accordingly, remove the note
in BUGS asking people to report working devices, but leave the note
saying not everything works correctly.

@First pass at removing clauses 3 and 4 from NetBSD licenses.

actual authors.
