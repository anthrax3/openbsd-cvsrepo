@Retire hp300, mvme68k and mvme88k ports. These ports have no users, keeping
this hardware alive is becoming increasingly difficult, and I should heed the
message sent by the three disks which have died on me over the last few days.

Noone sane will mourn these ports anyway. So long, and thanks for the fish.

.Sh NAME
.Nm osiop
.Nd Symbios/NCR 53C710 SCSI driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "osiop* at gsc? irq 9                  " Pq "hppa"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the
.Tn Symbios/NCR
53C710
.Tn SCSI
controller chip.
.Pp
The
.Tn Symbios/NCR
53C700
.Tn SCSI
controller is handled by the
.Xr oosiop 4
driver, while the
.Tn Symbios/NCR
53C8xx
.Tn PCI
.Tn SCSI
host adapters are handled by the
.Xr siop 4
driver.
.Sh CONFIGURATION
The
.Nm
driver supports the following
.Sy flags
for use in
.Xr config 8
files:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -compact -width "bits 8-15:"
.It bits 0-7 :
disable disconnect/reselect for the corresponding
.Tn SCSI
target
.It bits 8-15 :
disable synchronous negotiation for
.Tn SCSI
target
.It bits 16 :
disable DMA interrupts
.El
.Pp
.Qq Target
is synonymous with
.Tn SCSI
ID number.
.Pp
Note that
.Tn SCSI
tape drives should be allowed to perform disconnect/reselect or performance
will suffer.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver first appeared in
.Nx 1.6 .
.Pp
The original
.Tn NCR
53C710
driver appeared in
.Nx 1.0
amiga port, and
.An Izumi Tsutsui Aq Mt tsutsui@@ceres.dti.ne.jp
modified the driver and made it machine-independent.

@Merry Christmas Mickey!

First cut at osiop driver (LSI Logic/Symbios/NCR 53C710). For hppa
only at the moment.

Functional for the most part, but there are known problems:

1) SCSI_CHECK/REQUEST_SENSE not handled at all - simply returns a
zero'ed scsi_sense_data buffer. As a result all osiop sc_link's are
created with the ADEV_NODOORLOCK quirk to suppress PREVENT_ALLOW
commands from being issued (and failing) during probe.

2) Sync negotiation (wide is not supported on this chip) needs to be
validated due to some ominous comments in the source about being valid
only for the 33Mhz Zeus board.

3) Probe message needs fixing/completion to issue useful info. See 2).

4) Timeout/hangs occur under heavy load, e.g. make builds.

From NetBSD.
