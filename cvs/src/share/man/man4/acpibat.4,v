.Sh NAME
.Nm acpibat
.Nd ACPI control method battery
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "acpibat* at acpi?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver supports the ACPI Control Method Battery interface between the
battery and the host.
Information about the battery, such as capacity, recharge rate, voltage,
and serial number, is available through this driver.
Battery status is updated through an event triggered when a battery
changes state (such as starting to charge) and, as a failsafe if the
system does not support passing such events, every 10 seconds.
Battery status can be monitored using
.Xr sysctl 8
or
.Xr sensorsd 8 .
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr acpi 4 ,
.Xr acpisbs 4 ,
.Xr intro 4 ,
.Xr sensorsd 8 ,
.Xr sysctl 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver first appeared in
.Ox 3.8 .
.Sh AUTHORS
.An -nosplit
The
.Nm
driver was written by
.An Marco Peereboom Aq Mt marco@@openbsd.org .
.Sh BUGS
Some systems do not propagate battery insertion up to the driver.

log
@As requested by deraadt, split acpi(4) up into individual driver pages.

While doing this, improve and add the text of some manuals.  Some of
these are simply revived versions of the pages back from when they were
individual pages.

Input and ok from jmc.

Note:  When we wrote these pages, people submitted new pages to jmc and
I.  At some point during this, we decided to merge all pages into acpi(4)
(which is now being undone), and I lost track of who sent what.  Thus,
if you think you should be the copyright owner of any of these files,
get back to me in private.
