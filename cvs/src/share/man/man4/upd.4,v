.Sh NAME
.Nm upd
.Nd USB Power Devices sensor
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "upd* at uhidev?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for monitoring various sensors provided by
USB Power Devices (such as a UPS).
Supported sensor values are made available via the
.Xr sysctl 8
interface.
.Pp
The following sensors are supported by the driver:
.Pp
.Bl -item -offset indent -compact
.It
BatteryPresent
.It
ShutdownImminent
.It
ACPresent
.It
Overload

.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr intro 4 ,
.Xr uhidev 4 ,
.Xr sensorsd.conf 5 ,
.Xr sensorsd 8 ,
.Xr sysctl 8
.Pp
The USB Power Devices specification can be found at
.Lk http://www.usb.org/developers/hidpage/
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver first appeared in
.Ox 5.6 .
.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Nm
driver was written by
.An Andre de Oliveira .
.Sh BUGS
The
.Nm
driver does not indicate device health via aggregate or
individual sensor status.
Users who wish to monitor
.Nm
status using
.Xr sensorsd 8
must manually establish
.Dq high
and
.Dq low
limits for sensor values of interest via
.Xr sensorsd.conf 5 .

@Add upd(4) to the tree, disabled. Please do not enable it yet.

At this moment upd(4) exposes data from usb-based uninterruptable power systems
(or just USB Power Devices), sysctl(8) sensors (read snmpd(8) friendly), it is
also an "in-base" alternative to other 3rdparty UPS-monitoring software, we
have plans to bring more features.

This is my first "something" into the tree. Lots of thanks:
sthen@@ and blambert@@ are the ones to blame for the idea/challenge.
mpi@@ is the one whom pushed me to get it correct (from uhub -> uhidev).
reyk@@ mentored me on OpenBSD-way with previous iked/relayd experiences.

ok mpi@@, deraadt@@ "get it in".

.Sh EXAMPLES
In this example, the upd0 device is a regular UPS.
We use an entry on
.Xr sensorsd 8
to take an action when the battery level is below a 70%:
.Bd -literal
hw.sensors.upd0.percent0:low=70:command=/etc/sensorsd/lowbattwarn %l
.Ed
.Pp
The contents of lowbattwarn could be:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
#!/bin/ksh

if [ $# -lt 1 ]; then
        return;
fi

if [ $1 -lt 70 ]; then
        logger "ups battery warning-level, halting"
        /sbin/halt -p
fi

.Sh CAVEATS
When the battery is not present, even with Battery Presence indicator set to
Off the remaining battery sensors will still be present, besides their values
cannot be trusted.
.Pp
Users of apcupsd port will notice either
.Xr ugen 4 ,
is missing, it is necessary to disable the
.Nm
driver
in order to use apcupsd.
