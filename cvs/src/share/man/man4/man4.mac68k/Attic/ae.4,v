.Sh NAME
.Nm ae
.Nd DP8390-based NuBus Ethernet device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "ae* at nubus?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
interface provides access to a 10 Mb/s Ethernet network via the
National Semiconductor DP8390 Ethernet chip set.
This set includes the DP83902.
.Sh HARDWARE
The
.Nm
interface is currently known to support the following NuBus cards:
.Bd -filled -offset indent
.Bl -item -compact
.It
3Com EtherLink NB
.It
Apple EtherTalk NB
.It
Asante MacCon Series

.Xr hostname.if 5 ,
.Xr ifconfig 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
interface first appeared in
.Nx 1.0 .
.Sh CAVEATS
Some Asante
.Nm
cards are not designed to auto negotiate with 100 Mb/s devices.

Each of the host's network addresses is specified at boot time with an
.Dv SIOCSIFADDR
.Xr ioctl 2 .
The
.Nm
interface employs the address resolution protocol described in
.Xr arp 4
to dynamically map between Internet and Ethernet addresses on the
local network.

@The proper order of the ``introductory'' macros in a man page is .Dd/.Dt/.Os.
Out of the approximately 1450 man pages, only about 90 of them were wrong.
Thanks to kwesterback@@home.com for coming up with a script and patch to repair
this. The patch also inserted a .Os macro in the few man pages that were
missing one.
