.Sh NAME
.Nm sn
.Nd SONIC-based Ethernet device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "sn* at obio?"
.Cd "sn* at nubus?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
interface provides access to a 10 Mb/s Ethernet network via the
National Semiconductor DP83932 (SONIC) Ethernet chip set.
.Sh HARDWARE
The
.Nm
interface is currently known to support the following NuBus cards:
.Bd -filled -offset indent
.Bl -item -compact
.It
Cayman Gatorcard PDS
.It
Dayna DaynaPort/E30
.El
.Ed
.Pp
In addition, the
.Nm
interface supports on-board Ethernet for 500-series PowerBooks and
non-AV Quadras.

.Xr ifmedia 4 ,
.Xr inet 4 ,

.Xr mc 4 ,
.Xr netintro 4 ,
.Xr hostname.if 5 ,
.Xr ifconfig 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
interface first appeared in
.Ox 2.1 .

.Pp
Each of the host's network addresses is specified at boot time with an
.Dv SIOCSIFADDR
.Xr ioctl 2 .
The
.Nm
interface employs the address resolution protocol described in
.Xr arp 4
to dynamically map between Internet and Ethernet addresses on the
local network.

@The proper order of the ``introductory'' macros in a man page is .Dd/.Dt/.Os.
Out of the approximately 1450 man pages, only about 90 of them were wrong.
Thanks to kwesterback@@home.com for coming up with a script and patch to repair
this. The patch also inserted a .Os macro in the few man pages that were
missing one.

@Cleanup xrefs under SEE ALSO.  Specifically:

  - Sort xrefs by section, and then alphabetically.
  - Add missing commas between xref items.
  - Remove commas from the last xref entry.
  - Remove duplicate entries.
