.Dt ZSC 4 mac68k
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm zsc
.Nd
.Tn Zilog
8530 (ZSCC) serial communications driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "zsc0 at obio?"
.Cd "zstty* at zsc?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for Z8530- and Z85230-compatible
.Tn EIA
.Tn RS-232C
.Pf ( Tn CCITT
.Tn V.28 )
Dual
.Tn UART
chips.
The Z8530 has a 3 character buffer, while the Z85230 has an 8 character buffer.
However, due to limitations in the design of the Z85230, the driver is unable
to distinguish it from the Z8530 and will not enable any enhanced features of
the device.
.Pp
Input and output for each line may be set to any baud rate in the
range from 50 to 115200 (though some machines will not support more than
38400 reliably).
.Pp
The
.Nm zstty
driver provides a terminal interface, supporting all the standard
.Xr tty 4
ioctl calls.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /dev/ttya -compact
.It Pa /dev/ttya
.It Pa /dev/ttyb
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr ioctl 2 ,
.Xr intro 4 ,
.Xr obio 4 ,
.Xr tty 4
.Sh BUGS
Due to the small character buffer on the
.Tn Zilog
8530 chip, the driver has very strict latency requirements for its interrupt
service routine.
As a result, data loss may occur when using high speeds, particularly on older
(68020 or 68030) Macintosh models and on busy systems.

1.6
log
@First pass at removing clauses 3 and 4 from NetBSD licenses.

Not sure what's more surprising: how long it took for NetBSD to
catch up to the rest of the BSDs (including UCB), or the amount of
code that NetBSD has claimed for itself without attributing to the
actual authors.
