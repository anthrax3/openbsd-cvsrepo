.Sh NAME
.Nm ulpt
.Nd USB printer support
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "ulpt*   at uhub?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for USB printers that follow the printer
bi- or uni-directional protocol.
The bits in the minor number select various features of the driver.
.Bl -column "Minor Bit" "Functionxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx" -offset indent
.It Em "Minor Bit" Ta Em Function
.It 64 Ta "Do not initialize the device on the port."
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width Pa
.It Pa /dev/ulpt?
.El
.Pp
For some HP LaserJet printer models (1000, 1005, 1018, 1020), the driver needs
at least version 1.0 of the following firmware files, which are loaded when a
printer is attached:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent -compact
.It /etc/firmware/ulpt-hp1000
.It /etc/firmware/ulpt-hp1005
.It /etc/firmware/ulpt-hp1018
.It /etc/firmware/ulpt-hp1020
.El
.Pp
These firmware files are not free because HP refuses to grant
distribution rights.
As a result, even though
.Ox
includes the driver, the firmware files cannot be included and
users have to download these files on their own.
A port which can download and install the firmware can be found in
.Pa /usr/ports/sysutils/firmware/ulpt .
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr intro 4 ,
.Xr lpt 4 ,
.Xr uhub 4 ,
.Xr usb 4
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver
appeared in
.Nx 1.4 .
.Ox
support was added in
.Ox 2.7 .

@make -column lists pretty again;

specifically, rewrite them to permit some markup in the column headers,
and use "Ta" instead of literal tabs; mandoc does not currently match groff
100%, but a mandoc fix may be some time off, and we've gone enough releases
with poorly formatting column lists.

in some cases i have rewritten the lists as -tag, where -column made
little sense.

@First pass at removing clauses 3 and 4 from NetBSD licenses.

Not sure what's more surprising: how long it took for NetBSD to
catch up to the rest of the BSDs (including UCB), or the amount of
code that NetBSD has claimed for itself without attributing to the
actual authors.
