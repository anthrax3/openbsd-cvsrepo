.Sh NAME
.Nm pckbc
.Nd PC (ISA) keyboard controller driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "pckbc* at isa? flags 0x00           " Pq "alpha, amd64, i386, loongson"
.Cd "pckbc* at ebus?                     " Pq "sparc64"
.Cd "pckbd* at pckbc?"
.Cd "pms*   at pckbc?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver handles resource allocation and device attachment for the
traditional PC/AT keyboard controller.
It provides two logical connections for child devices, the
.Dq keyboard
slot for a keyboard and the
.Dq auxiliary
slot for mice (the latter might be missing in older keyboard controllers).
.\" .Pp
.\" The optional
.\" .Dq slot
.\" locator argument can be used to force unusual connections of devices to
.\" logical slots.
.\" This feature is for experimentation only, it will not be
.\" useful in normal operation.
.Pp
To avoid attaching a phantom PS/2 keyboard device, the
.Nm
driver will attempt to detect USB legacy keyboard emulation on amd64 and i386
systems.
Unfortunately, the detection heuristics may fail on older systems with a real
PS/2 keyboard.
The keyboard can be forced to attach on these systems, by changing the
device flags to 1.

@Retire OpenBSD/cats. Hardware is nice but prone to catch fire, and the firmware
is anything but useful. Nevertheless this was a very good platform to use as
an OpenBSD/*arm* starting point, but nowadays this platform is not necessary
anymore.

Somehow these CATS motherboard are just like AUI hubs, with the difference that,
when my AUI hub caught fire, 10base5 support was not removed from the networking
code.
