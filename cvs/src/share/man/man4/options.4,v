.Dt OPTIONS 4
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm options
.Nd kernel configuration options
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd option ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This manual page describes a number of miscellaneous kernel
configuration options that may be specified in a kernel config file.
See
.Xr config 8
for information on how to configure and build kernels.
.Em Note:
options are passed to the compile process as
.Fl D
flags to the C compiler.
.Sh DEBUGGING OPTIONS
.Bl -ohang
.It Cd makeoptions DEBUG=""
Do not build the debug kernel
.Pa bsd.gdb .
Normally,
.Pa bsd.gdb
is built
(in addition to the regular
.Pa bsd
kernel)
and is used for debugging kernels and their crash dumps with
.Xr gdb 1 .
A crash dump can be debugged by starting gdb with
.Pa bsd.gdb
as an argument (no core file) and then using the gdb command
.Dq target kvm COREFILE .
.It Cd makeoptions PROF="-pg"
The
.Fl pg
flag causes the kernel to be compiled with support for profiling.
The
.Cm option GPROF
is required for the kernel compile to succeed.
.It Cd option ACCOUNTING
Adds support for the
.Xr acct 2
system call.
.It Cd option DDB
Compiles in a kernel debugger for diagnosing kernel problems.
See
.Xr ddb 4
for details.
.It Cd option DDB_SAFE_CONSOLE
Allows a break into the kernel debugger during boot.
Useful when debugging problems that can cause
.Xr init 8
to fail.
.It Cd option DDB_STRUCT
Compiles in symbolic information about the various data structures used by the
kernel, for use within the kernel debugger.
This option is currently not supported on alpha and m88k based platforms.
.It Cd option DEBUG
Turns on miscellaneous kernel debugging.
Since options are turned into preprocessor defines (see above),
.Cm option DEBUG
is equivalent to doing a
.Em #define DEBUG
throughout the kernel.
Much of the kernel has
.Em #ifdef DEBUG
conditional debugging code.
Note that many parts of the kernel (typically device drivers) include their own
.Em #ifdef XXX_DEBUG
conditionals instead.
.It Cd option DIAGNOSTIC
Adds code to the kernel that does internal consistency checks.
This code will cause the kernel to panic if corruption of internal data
structures is detected.

It defaults to 1536.
.El
.Sh FILE SYSTEMS
.Bl -ohang
.It Cd option CD9660
Includes code for the ISO 9660 + Rock Ridge file system, which is the
standard file system used on many CD-ROMs.
It also supports Joliet extensions.
See
.Xr mount_cd9660 8
for details.
.It Cd option EXT2FS
Includes code implementing the Second Extended File System
.Em ( EXT2FS ) ,
commonly used on the Linux operating system.
This option is provided here for compatibility.
Some specific features of
.Em EXT2FS
like the "behavior on errors" are not implemented.
This file system
can't be used with
.Li uid_t
or
.Li gid_t
values greater than 65535.
Also, the filesystem will not function correctly on architectures with
differing byte-orders.
That is, a big-endian machine will not be able to read an
ext2fs filesystem created on an i386 or other little-endian machine.
See
.Xr mount_ext2fs 8
for details.
.It Cd option FFS
Includes code implementing the Berkeley Fast File System
.Em ( FFS ) .
Most machines need this if they are not running diskless.
.It Cd option FFS2
Includes code implementing the enhanced Fast File System
.Em ( FFS2 ) .
.It Cd option MFS
Include the memory file system
.Em ( MFS ) .
This file system stores files in swappable memory, and produces
notable performance improvements when it is used as the file store
for
.Pa /tmp
or similar mount points.
See
.Xr mount_mfs 8
for details.
.It Cd option MSDOSFS
Includes support for the MS-DOS FAT file system.
The kernel also implements the Windows 95
extensions which permit the use of longer, mixed-case file names.
See
.Xr mount_msdos 8
and
.Xr fsck_msdos 8
for details.
.It Cd option NFSCLIENT
Include the client side of the
.Em NFS
(Network File System) remote file sharing protocol.
Although the bulk of the code implementing
.Em NFS
is kernel based, several user level daemons are needed for it to work.
See
.Xr mount_nfs 8
for details on NFS.
.It Cd option NTFS
Includes support for reading NTFS file systems.
See
.Xr mount_ntfs 8
for details.
.It Cd option UDF
Includes code for the UDF file systems typically found on DVD discs.
See
.Xr mount_udf 8
for details.
.It Cd option TMPFS
Includes code for the TMPFS efficient memory file system.
See
.Xr mount_tmpfs 8
for details.
.El
.Sh FILE SYSTEM OPTIONS
.Bl -ohang
.It Cd option BUFCACHEPERCENT= Ns Ar integer
Percentage of RAM to use as a file system buffer.
It defaults to 20.
.It Cd option EXT2FS_SYSTEM_FLAGS
This option changes the behavior of the APPEND and IMMUTABLE flags
for a file on an
.Em EXT2FS
filesystem.
Without this option, the superuser or owner of the file can set and clear them.
With this option, only the superuser can set them, and they can't be cleared
if the securelevel is greater than 0.
See also
.Xr chflags 1 .
.It Cd option FFS_SOFTUPDATES
Enables a scheme that uses partial ordering of buffer cache operations
to allow metadata updates in FFS to happen asynchronously, increasing write
performance significantly.
Normally, the FFS filesystem writes metadata updates synchronously which exacts
a performance penalty in favor of filesystem integrity.
With soft updates, the performance of asynchronous writes is gained while
retaining the safety of synchronous metadata updates.
.Pp
Soft updates must be enabled on a per-filesystem basis.
See
.Xr mount 8
for details.
.Pp
Processors with a small kernel address space, such as the sun4 and sun4c, do
not have enough kernel memory to support soft updates.
Attempts to use this option with these CPUs will cause a kernel hang or panic
after a short period of use as the kernel will quickly run out of memory.
This is not related to the amount of physical memory present in the machine --
it is a limitation of the CPU architecture itself.
.It Cd option FIFO
Adds support for
.At V
style FIFOs (i.e.,
.Dq named pipes ) .
This option is recommended in almost all cases as many programs use these.
.It Cd option NFSSERVER
Include the server side of the
.Em NFS
(Network File System) remote file sharing protocol.
Although the bulk of the code implementing
.Em NFS
is kernel based, several user level daemons are needed for it to
work.
See
.Xr mountd 8
and
.Xr nfsd 8
for details.
.It Cd option QUOTA
Enables kernel support for file system quotas.
See
.Xr quotaon 8 ,
.Xr edquota 8 ,
.Xr repquota 8 ,
and
.Xr quota 1
for details.
Note that quotas only work on
.Dq ffs
file systems, although
.Xr rpc.rquotad 8
permits them to be accessed over
.Em NFS .
.It Cd option UFS_DIRHASH
This option enables using an in memory hash table to speed lookups
in large directories.
.El
.Sh MISCELLANEOUS OPTIONS
.Bl -ohang
.It Cd option APERTURE

(vendor names and other information is printed, etc.).
.It Cd option PCMCIAVERBOSE
Makes the boot process more verbose for PCMCIA peripherals.
.It Cd option USER_PCICONF
Enables the user level access to the PCI bus configuration space
through ioctls on the
.Pa /dev/pci
device.
It's used by the
.Xr Xorg 1
server on some architectures.
See
.Xr pci 4
for details.
.It Cd option UVM_SWAP_ENCRYPT
Enables kernel support for encrypting pages that are written out to
swap storage.
Swap encryption prevents sensitive data from remaining
on the disk even after the operating system has been shut down.
This option should be turned on if cryptographic filesystems are used.
The sysctl variable
.Em vm.swapencrypt.enable
controls its behaviour.
See
.Xr sysctl 8
and
.Xr sysctl 3
for details.
.El
.Sh NETWORKING OPTIONS
.Bl -ohang
.It Cd option ENCDEBUG
This option enables debugging information to be conditionally logged
in case IPSEC encounters errors.
The option
.Em IPSEC
is required along with this option.
Debug logging can be turned on/off through the use of the
.Em net.inet.ip.encdebug
sysctl variable.
If
.Em net.inet.ip.encdebug
is 1, debug logging is on.
See
.Xr sysctl 8
and
.Xr sysctl 3
for details.
.It Cd option INET6
Includes support for the IPv6 protocol stack.
See
.Xr inet6 4
for details.
.Em INET6
enables multicast routing code as well.
.It Cd option IPSEC
This option enables IP security protocol support.
See
.Xr ipsec 4
for more details.
.It Cd option KEY
Enables PFKEYv2 (RFC 2367) support.
While not IP specific, this option is usually used in conjunction with option
.Em IPSEC .
.It Cd option MROUTING
Includes support for IP multicast routers.
Multicast routing is controlled by the
.Xr mrouted 8
daemon.
.It Cd option ND6_DEBUG
The option sets the default value of
.Em net.inet6.icmp6.nd6_debug
to 1,
for debugging IPv6 neighbor discovery protocol handling.
See
.Xr sysctl 3
for details.
.It Cd option PIPEX
Includes pipex in-kernel acceleration for PPPoE, L2TP or PPTP.
See
.Xr pipex 4
for details.
.It Cd option PPP_BSDCOMP
Enables BSD compressor for PPP connections.
.It Cd option PPP_DEFLATE
For use in conjunction with PPP_BSDCOMP; provides an interface to zlib for PPP
for deflate compression/decompression.
.It Cd option PPPOE_TERM_UNKNOWN_SESSIONS
Send PADT to terminate open sessions before connecting.
See
.Xr pppoe 4 .
.It Cd option SOCKET_SPLICE
Enables zero-copy socket splicing in the kernel.
See
.Dv SO_SPLICE
in
.Xr setsockopt 2
and
.Xr sosplice 9
for details.
.It Cd option TCP_ECN
Turns on Explicit Congestion Notification (RFC 3168).
.Em ECN
allows intermediate routers to use the Congestion Experienced
codepoint in the IP header as an indication of congestion, and allows
TCP to adjust the transmission rate using this signal.
Both communication endpoints negotiate enabling
.Em ECN
functionality at the TCP connection establishment.
.It Cd option TCP_FACK
Turns on forward acknowledgements allowing a more precise estimate of
outstanding data during the fast recovery phase by using
.Em SACK
information.
This option can only be used together with
.Em TCP_SACK .
.It Cd option TCP_SACK
Turns on selective acknowledgements.
Additional information about
segments already received can be transmitted back to the sender,
thus indicating segments that have been lost and allowing for
a swifter recovery.
Both communication endpoints need to support
.Em SACK .
The fallback behaviour is NewReno fast recovery phase, which allows
one lost segment to be recovered per round trip time.
When more than one segment has been dropped per window, the transmission can
continue without waiting for a retransmission timeout.
.It Cd option TCP_SIGNATURE
Turns on support for the TCP MD5 Signature option (RFC 2385).
This is used by
Internet backbone routers to provide per-packet authentication for the TCP
packets used to communicate BGP routing information.
You will also need a
routing daemon that supports this option in order to actually use it.
.El
.Sh OPERATION RELATED OPTIONS
.Bl -ohang -compact
.It Cd option BUFPAGES= Ns Ar value
.It Cd option NBUF= Ns Ar value
These options set the number of pages available for the buffer cache.
Their default value is a machine dependent value, often calculated as
between 5% and 10% of total available RAM.
.Pp
.It Cd option DST= Ns Ar value
If
.Ar value
is non-zero, indicates that the hardware realtime clock device
is one hour ahead of the offset given in
.Sq TIMEZONE ,
due to Daylight Saving Time (DST).
If
.Ar value
is zero, the hardware realtime clock device is not in Daylight Saving Time.
.Pp
.It Cd option NKMEMPAGES= Ns Ar value
.It Cd option NKMEMPAGES_MAX= Ns Ar value
Size of kernel malloc area in PAGE_SIZE-sized logical pages.
This area is covered by the kernel submap
.Em kmem_map .
The kernel attempts to auto-size this map based on the amount of
physical memory in the system.
Platform-specific code may place bounds on this computed size,
which may be viewed with the
.Xr sysctl 8
variable
.Em vm.nkmempages .
See
.Pa /usr/include/machine/param.h
for the default upper bound.
The related option
.Sq NKMEMPAGES_MAX
allows the bounds to be overridden in the kernel configuration file
in the event the computed value is insufficient resulting in an
.Dq out of space in kmem_map
panic.
.Pp
.It Cd option \&"TIMEZONE= Ns Ar value Ns Cm \&"
.Ar value
indicates the time zone offset of the hardware realtime clock device,
in minutes,
from UTC.
It is useful when the hardware realtime clock device is configured
with local time,
when dual-booting
.Ox
with other operating systems on a single machine.
For instance, if the hardware realtime clock is set to Tokyo time,
.Ar value
should be
.Li \&-540
as Tokyo local time is 9 hours ahead of UTC.
Double quotes are needed when specifying a negative
.Ar value .
.El
.Sh SCSI SUBSYSTEM OPTIONS
.Bl -ohang
.It Cd option SCSI_DELAY= Ns Ar value
Delay for
.Ar value
seconds before starting to probe the first SCSI bus.
This can be used if a SCSI device needs extra time to get ready.
.It Cd option SCSIDEBUG
Enable printing of SCSI subsystem debugging info to the console.
Each of
.Em SCSIDEBUG_LEVEL ,
.Em SCSIDEBUG_BUSES ,
.Em SCSIDEBUG_TARGETS
and
.Em SCSIDEBUG_LUNS
must have non-zero values for any debugging info to be printed.
Only
.Em SCSIDEBUG_LEVEL
has a default value (SDEV_DB1 | SDEV_DB2) that is non-zero.
.It Cd option SCSIDEBUG_BUSES= Ns Ar value
Define which SCSI buses will print debug info.
Each bit enables debugging info for the corresponding bus.
e.g. a value of 0x1 enables debug info for bus 0.
.It Cd option SCSIDEBUG_LEVEL= Ns Ar value
Define which of the four levels of debugging info are printed.
Each bit enables a level, and multiple levels are specified by setting multiple
bits.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
0x0010	(SDEV_DB1) SCSI commands, errors, and data
0x0020	(SDEV_DB2) routine flow
0x0040	(SDEV_DB3) routine internals
0x0080	(SDEV_DB4) miscellaneous addition debugging
.Ed
.Pp
If
.Em SCSIDEBUG_LEVEL
is undefined, a value of 0x0030 (SDEV_DB1|SDEV_DB2) is used.
.It Cd option SCSIDEBUG_LUNS= Ns Ar value
Define which SCSI luns will print debug info.
Each bit enables debugging info for the corresponding lun.
.It Cd option SCSIDEBUG_TARGETS= Ns Ar value
Define which SCSI targets will print debug info.
Each bit enables debugging info for the corresponding target.
.It Cd option SCSITERSE
Terser SCSI error messages.
This omits the table for decoding ASC/ASCQ info, saving about 30KB.
.El
.Sh SYSTEM V IPC OPTIONS
.Bl -ohang
.It Cd option SEMMNI= Ns Ar value
Number of semaphore identifiers (also called semaphore handles
and semaphore sets) available in the system.
Default value is 10.
The kernel allocates memory for the control structures at startup,
so arbitrarily large values should be avoided.
.It Cd option SEMMNS= Ns Ar value
Maximum number of semaphores in all sets in the system.
Default value is 60.
.It Cd option SEMMNU= Ns Ar value
Maximum number of semaphore undo structures in the system.
Default value is 30.
.It Cd option SEMUME= Ns Ar value
Maximum number of per-process undo operation entries in the
system.
Semaphore undo operations are invoked by the kernel when
.Xr semop 2
is called with the SEM_UNDO flag and the process holding
the semaphores terminates unexpectedly.
Default value is 10.
.It Cd option SHMMAXPGS= Ns Ar value
Sets the maximum number of
.At V
style shared memory pages that are available through the
.Xr shmget 2
system call.
Default value is 1024 on most architectures.

This option therefore can lead to a significant decrease in the performance
of certain code in the kernel if enabled.
Examples of such code include the

system call.
Default value is 1024 on most architectures.
See
.Pa /usr/include/machine/vmparam.h
for the default.
.It Cd option SEMMNI=value
Number of semaphore identifiers (also called semaphore handles
and semaphore sets) available in the system.
Default value is 10.
The kernel allocates memory for the control structures at startup,
so arbitrarily large values should be avoided.
.It Cd option SEMMNS=value
Maximum number of semaphores in all sets in the system.
Default value is 60.
.It Cd option SEMMNU=value
Maximum number of semaphore undo structures in the system.
Default value is 30.
.It Cd option SEMUME=value
Maximum number of per-process undo operation entries in the
system.
Semaphore undo operations are invoked by the kernel when
.Xr semop 2
is called with the SEM_UNDO flag and the process holding
the semaphores terminates unexpectedly.
Default value is 10.

.Ss Operation Related Options
.Pp
.Bl -ohang -compact
.It Cd option NKMEMPAGES=value
.It Cd option NKMEMPAGES_MIN=value
.It Cd option NKMEMPAGES_MAX=value
Size of kernel malloc area in PAGE_SIZE-sized logical pages.
This area is covered by the kernel submap
.Em kmem_map .
The kernel attempts to auto-size this map based on the amount of
physical memory in the system.
Platform-specific code may place bounds on this computed size,
which may be viewed with the
.Xr sysctl 8
variable
.Em vm.nkmempages .
See
.Pa /usr/include/machine/param.h
for the default upper and lower bounds.
The related options
.Sq NKMEMPAGES_MIN
and
.Sq NKMEMPAGES_MAX
allow the bounds to be overridden in the kernel configuration file.
These options are provided in the event the computed value is
insufficient resulting in an
.Dq out of space in kmem_map
panic.
.Pp
.It Cd option NBUF=value
.It Cd option BUFPAGES=value
These options set the number of pages available for the buffer cache.
Their default value is a machine dependent value, often calculated as
between 5% and 10% of total available RAM.
.Pp
.It Cd option APM_NOPRINT
This option is supported on the i386 architecture.
When enabled, kernel messages regarding the status of the automatic power
management system
.Tn ( APM )
are suppressed.
.Tn APM
status can still be obtained using
.Xr apm 8
and/or
.Xr apmd 8 .
.Pp
.It Cd option \&"TIMEZONE=value\&"
.Ar value
indicates the time zone offset of the hardware realtime clock device,
in minutes,
from UTC.
It is useful when the hardware realtime clock device is configured
with local time,
when dual-booting
.Ox
with other operating systems on a single machine.
For instance, if the hardware realtime clock is set to Tokyo time,
.Ar value
should be
.Li \&-540
as Tokyo local time is 9 hours ahead of UTC.
Double quotes are needed when specifying a negative
.Ar value .
.Pp
.It Cd option DST=value
If
.Ar value
is non-zero, indicates that the hardware realtime clock device
is one hour ahead of the offset given in
.Sq TIMEZONE ,
due to Daylight Saving Time (DST).
If
.Ar value
is zero, the hardware realtime clock device is not in Daylight Saving Time.

Includes code for a file system which can be mounted on

This filesystem permits access to the per-process file descriptor
space via special files in the file system.
See

Note that this facility is redundant, and thus unneeded on most

systems, since the

On most systems, instances of

.It Cd option UNION
Includes code for the union file system, which permits directories to
be mounted on top of each other in such a way that both file systems
remain visible -- this permits tricks like allowing writing (and the

mounting a local writable file system on top of the read-only file

With this option enabled, the machine

other machines.
Note that even without this option, the kernel will
still forward some packets (such as source routed packets) -- removing
.Em IPFORWARDING
is insufficient to stop all routing through a bastion host on a
firewall -- source routing is controlled independently.

.It Cd option NVNODE=integer
This option sets the size of the cache used by the name-to-inode translation
routines, (a.k.a. the
.Fn namei
cache, though called by many other names in the kernel source).
By default,
this cache has
.Dv NPROC
(set as 20 + 16 * MAXUSERS) * (80 + NPROC / 8) entries.
A reasonable way to derive a value of
.Dv NVNODE ,
should a large number of namei cache misses be noticed with a tool such as
.Xr systat 1 ,
is to examine the system's current computed value with
.Xr sysctl 8 ,
(which calls this parameter "kern.maxvnodes") and to increase this value
until either the namei cache hit rate improves or it is determined that
the system does not benefit substantially from an increase in the size of
the namei cache.

@Remove ipf.  Darren Reed has interpreted his (old, new, whichever)
licence in a way that makes ipf not free according to the rules we
established over 5 years ago, at www.openbsd.org/goals.html (and those
same basic rules govern the other *BSD projects too).  Specifically,
Darren says that modified versions are not permitted.  But software
which OpenBSD uses and redistributes must be free to all (be they
people or companies), for any purpose they wish to use it, including
modification, use, peeing on, or even integration into baby mulching
machines or atomic bombs to be dropped on Australia.  Furthermore, we
know of a number of companies using ipf with modification like us, who
are now in the same situation, and we hope that some of them will work
with us to fill this gap that now exists in OpenBSD (temporarily, we
hope).

.It Cd option MCLSHIFT=value
This option is the base-2 logarithm of the size of mbuf clusters.  The
BSD networking stack keeps network packets in a linked list, or chain,
of kernel buffer objects called mbufs.  The system provides larger mbuf
clusters as an optimization for large packets, instead of using long
chains for large packets.  The mbuf cluster size, or
.Em MCLBYTES,
must be a power of two, and is computed as two raised to the power
.Em MCLSHIFT.
On systems with Ethernet network adaptors,
.Em	MCLSHIFT
is often set to 11, giving 2048-byte mbuf clusters, large enough to
hold a 1500-byte Ethernet frame in a single cluster.  Systems with
networks supporting larger frame sizes like ATM, FDDI, or HIPPI may
perform better with MCLSHIFT set to 12 or 13, giving mbuf cluster
sizes of 4096 and 8192 bytes, respectively.

This causes the kernel to keep a list of "friendly" hosts, that is IP

addresses are allowed to proceed. Connections from other addresses
trigger a mechanism for determining whether those are "friendly". The
list of friendly addresses is controlled by the
.Em TCK_NFRIENDS
option, which is by default set to 16. Unfortunately, hosts behind

.It Cd option NTP
Turns on in-kernel precision timekeeping support used by software
implementing

(Network Time Protocol, RFC1305).
The

option adds an in-kernel phase-locked loop (PLL) for normal
.Em NTP
operation, and a frequency-locked loop (FLL) for intermittently-connected
operation.
.Xr xntpd 8
will employ a user-level PLL when kernel support is unavailable,
but the in-kernel version has lower latency and more precision, and
so typically keeps much better time.
The interface to the kernel
.Em NTP
support is provided by the
.Xr ntp_adjtime 2
and
.Xr ntp_gettime 2
system calls, which are intended for use by
.Xr xntpd 8
and are enabled by the option.
On systems with sub-microsecond resolution timers, or where (HZ / 100000)

.Em NTP
option also enables extended-precision arithmetic to keep track of
fractional clock ticks at NTP time-format precision.
.It Cd option SETUIDSCRIPTS
Allows scripts with the setuid bit set to execute as the effective

NOTE: Using this option will also enable

(Universal Coordinated Time, once known as

The

option is used on some ports (such as the i386) to tell the kernel
that the hardware clock is offset from
.Em UTC
by the specified number of minutes. This is typically used when a
machine boots several operating systems and one of them wants the
hardware clock to run in the local time zone and not in

means
the hardware clock is set to US Eastern Time (300 minutes behind

(Note:
.Em RTC_OFFSET

which is the source actually used to determine the clock offset, and
which may be accessed via the kern.rtc_offset sysctl variable.
See

This option enables a kernel serial line discipline for receiving time
phase signals from an external reference clock such as a radio clock.
(The

option (which see) must be on if the
.Em PPS
option is used.)
Some reference clocks generate a pulse per second (PPS) signal in
phase with their time source. The
.Em PPS
line discipline receives this signal on either the data leads
or the DCD control lead of a serial port.
.Em NTP
uses the PPS signal to discipline the local clock oscillator to a high
degree of precision (typically less than 50 microseconds in time and
0.1 ppm in accuracy).
.Em PPS
can also generate a serial output pulse when the system receives a PPS
interrupt.  This can be used to measure the system interrupt latency
and thus calibrate
.Em NTP
to account for it.
Using
.Em PPS
usually requires a
gadget box
to convert from TTL to RS-232 signal levels.
The gadget box and PPS are described in more detail in the HTML documentation
