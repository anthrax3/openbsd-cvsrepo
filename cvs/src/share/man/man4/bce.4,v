.Nd Broadcom BCM4401 10/100 Ethernet device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "bce* at pci?"
.Cd "bmtphy* at mii?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
provides support for the Broadcom BCM4401 10/100 Ethernet card.
.Pp
The following media types and options (as given to
.Xr ifconfig 8 )
are supported:
.Bl -tag -width xxx -offset indent
.It Cm media No autoselect
Enable autoselection of the media type and options (default).
.It Cm media No 100baseTX Cm mediaopt No full-duplex
Set 100Mbps (Fast Ethernet) operation and force full-duplex mode.
.It Cm media No 100baseTX Cm mediaopt No half-duplex
Set 100Mbps (Fast Ethernet) operation and force half-duplex mode.
.It Cm media No 10baseT Cm mediaopt No full-duplex
Set 10Mbps operation and force full-duplex.
.It Cm media No 10baseT Cm mediaopt No half-duplex
Set 10Mbps operation and force half-duplex.
.El
.Pp
If no media options are present, the
.Nm
driver places the card into autoselect mode.

@Remove the BUGS and DIAGNOSTICS section. The DMA limitation is no longer
a problem and it does not make sense to explain error messages with
"A fatal initialization error has occurred." this should be fairly
obvious when the interface does not show up in ifconfig.

.It "bce%d: unable to find mem space"
A fatal initialization error has occurred.
.It "bce%d: unable to wake up from power state D%d"
The card has lost its configuration data during power save mode.
.It "bce%d: couldn't map interrupt"
A fatal initialization error has occurred.
.It "bce%d: couldn't establish interrupt"
A fatal initialization error has occurred.

A fatal initialization error has occurred.
.It "bce%d: unable to create rx DMA map, error = %d"

.It "bce%d: Tx packet consumes too many DMA segments, dropping..."
An outgoing packet didn't fit in the allocated number of segments.
.It "bce%d: unable to load Tx buffer, error = %d"
Short on resources when transmitting a packet, it will be retried later.
.It "bce%d: device timeout"
The device has stopped responding to the network or there is a problem
with the network connection (cable).
.It "bce%d: transmit fifo underflow"
An error occurred, the interface will be reinitialized.
.It "bce%d: receive fifo overflow"
An error occurred, the interface will be reinitialized.
.It "bce%d: receive descriptor underflow"
An error occurred, the interface will be reinitialized.
.It "bce%d: descriptor protocol error"
An error occurred, the interface will be reinitialized.
.It "bce%d: data error"
An error occurred, the interface will be reinitialized.
.It "bce%d: descriptor error"
An error occurred, the interface will be reinitialized.
.It "bce%d: general purpose timeout"
An error occurred, the interface will be reinitialized.
.It "bce%d: unable to allocate or map rx(%d) mbuf, error = %d"
Failed to initialize the interface.
.It "bce%d: timed out writing pkt filter ctl"
Failed to add MAC address.
.It "bce%d: timed out disabling ethernet mac"
A problem occurred when resetting the interface.
.It "bce%d: receive dma did not go idle after error"

.It "bce%d: timed out resetting ethernet mac"
A problem occurred when resetting the interface.
.It "bce%d: while resetting core, reject did not set"
A problem occurred when resetting the interface.
.It "bce%d: while resetting core, busy did not clear"
A problem occurred when resetting the interface.
.It "bce%d: PHY read timed out reading phy %d, reg %d, val = %x"
An error occurred when reading a PHY register on the MII.
.It "bce%d: PHY read timed out writing phy %d, reg %d, val = %x"
An error occurred when writing a PHY register on the MII.

.Sh BUGS
The BCM4401 hardware can not do DMA to addresses above 1GB.
Since the
.Nm
driver makes no effort to circumvent this problem, it is likely that
the device will not work properly on machines with more than 1GB of
system memory.

log
@First pass at removing clauses 3 and 4 from NetBSD licenses.

Not sure what's more surprising: how long it took for NetBSD to
catch up to the rest of the BSDs (including UCB), or the amount of
code that NetBSD has claimed for itself without attributing to the
actual authors.
