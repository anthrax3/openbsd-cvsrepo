.Sh NAME
.Nm uthum
.Nd TEMPer HID thermometer and hygrometer
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "uthum* at uhidev?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for pcsensors TEMPer devices.
The following devices are supported by the
.Nm
driver:
.Bl -column "TEMPerNTCXXX" "Sensors" -offset indent
.It Em "Device" Ta Em "Sensors"
.It Li "TEMPerHUM" Ta "1 Temperature and 1 Humidity"
.It Li "TEMPer" Ta "1 Temperature (internal)"
.It Li "TEMPer1" Ta "1 Temperature (external)"
.It Li "TEMPer2" Ta "2 Temperature (internal/external)"
.It Li "TEMPerNTC" Ta "2 Temperature (internal/external)"
.El
.Pp
The sensor possesses a collection of sensor values which are
made available through the
.Xr sysctl 8
interface.
The humidity data unit is "%RH" (relative humidity) and the
temperature data unit is "degC".
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr intro 4 ,
.Xr uhidev 4 ,
.Xr sensorsd 8 ,
.Xr sysctl 8
.Sh AUTHORS
.An -nosplit
The
.Nm
driver was written by
.An Yojiro UO Aq Mt yuo@@nui.org .
.Sh BUGS
There is not enough support for the external temperature sensor
of the TEMPerNTC.
Currently the
.Nm
driver supports about 0 degC to 120 degC for the sensor.
