.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm autoconf
.Nd diagnostics from the autoconfiguration code
.Sh DESCRIPTION
When
.Ox
bootstraps it probes the innards of the machine
on which it is running
and locates controllers, drives, and other devices, printing out
what it finds on the console.
This procedure is driven by a system configuration table which is processed by
.Xr config 8
and compiled into each kernel.
Devices which exist in the machine but are not configured into the
kernel are usually not detected.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr intro 4 ,
.Xr boot_amd64 8 ,
.Xr config 8

@Very timid start at an amd64 man4 section. intro(4) is pathetic because it
matches GENERIC at the moment.
