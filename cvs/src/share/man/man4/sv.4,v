.Sh NAME
.Nm sv
.Nd S3 SonicVibes audio device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "sv* at pci?"
.Cd "audio* at sv?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for S3 SonicVibes (S3-617) chipset-based
cards.
Disabling the SRS 3-D spatial feature of the chip is recommended for higher
quality audio.
This can be done in software by issuing the following command:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ mixerctl outputs.spatial=off
.Ed
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr audio 4 ,
.Xr intro 4 ,
.Xr pci 4
.Sh HISTORY
This driver is based on the
.Xr eap 4
driver by Lennart Augustsson.
The
.Nm
device driver first appeared in
.Ox 2.6 .
.Sh BUGS
The "FM" DAC, wavetable synth, and MIDI port are not
supported.
Recording at a rate different from playback is supported by
the chip but not the driver.
The mixer does not allow control of reverb, digital loopback, or 3-D SRS
features.
The chip does not support exact record speeds (it seems) of 11025Hz,
22050Hz, and so on, used by Windows audio.
Usually, the actual record is rate is around +/- 50Hz of the specified.

@Incomplete section 4 mi manual page cleanup.
- make configuration lines match GENERIC files
- more Xr (hopefully usefule Xr)
- never mention intro(4) on non-physical devices (i.e. protocols), always
mention it for physical devices
- random text style and quoting fixes
- drivers ported from FreeBSD did mention rc.conf instead of hostname.if as
the place to put mediaopt
- some .Tn UNIX -> .Ox replacements
- etc, etc...

@- remove all trailing whitespace
     * except when it is escaped with a `\' at the end of the line
- fix remaining .Nm usage as well
- this is from a patch I received from kwesterback@@home.com, who has been
  working on some scripts for fixing formatting errors in mdoc'd man pages

Ok, so there could be a cost/benefit debate with this commit, but since I have
the patch we might as well commit it...
