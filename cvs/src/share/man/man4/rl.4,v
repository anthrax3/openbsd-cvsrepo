.Nd Realtek 8129/8139 10/100 Ethernet device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "rl* at pci?"
.Cd "rl* at cardbus?"
.Cd "rlphy* at mii?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for PCI Ethernet adapters and embedded
controllers based on the Realtek 8129 and 8139 Fast Ethernet controller
chips.
This includes, among others, the following cards:
.Pp
.Bl -item -offset indent -compact

.It

.It

.It

.It

.It

.It

.It
SMC EZ Card 10/100 PCI 1211-TX
.It
TRENDnet TE100-PCBUSR CardBus
.El
.Pp
The Realtek controllers use bus master DMA but do not use a
descriptor-based data transfer mechanism.
The receiver uses a single fixed size ring buffer from which packets must be
copied into mbufs.
For transmission, there are only four outbound packet
address registers which require all outgoing packets to be stored
as contiguous buffers.
Furthermore, outbound packet buffers must be longword aligned or else
transmission will fail.
.Pp
The 8129 differs from the 8139 in that the 8139 has an internal
PHY which is controlled through special direct access registers
whereas the 8129 uses an external PHY via an MII bus.
The 8139 supports both 10 and 100Mbps speeds in either full or half duplex.
The 8129 can support the same speeds and modes given an appropriate
PHY chip.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media types:
.Bl -tag -width full-duplex
.It autoselect
Enable autoselection of the media type and options.
This is only supported if the PHY chip attached to the Realtek controller
supports NWAY autonegotiation.
The user can manually override the autoselected mode by adding media options
to the appropriate
.Xr hostname.if 5
file.
.It 10baseT
Set 10Mbps operation.
The
.Ar mediaopt
option can also be used to select either
.Ar full-duplex
or
.Ar half-duplex
modes.
.It 100baseTX
Set 100Mbps (Fast Ethernet) operation.
The
.Ar mediaopt
option can also be used to select either
.Ar full-duplex
or
.Ar half-duplex
modes.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media options:
.Bl -tag -width full-duplex
.It full-duplex
Force full duplex operation.
.It half-duplex
Force half duplex operation.
.El
.Pp
Note that the 100baseTX media type is only available if supported
by the adapter.
For more information on configuring this device, see
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "rl0: couldn't map memory"
A fatal initialization error has occurred.
.It "rl0: couldn't map interrupt"
A fatal initialization error has occurred.
.It "rl0: watchdog timeout"
The device has stopped responding to the network, or there is a problem with
the network connection (cable).
.It "rl0: no memory for rx list"
The driver failed to allocate an mbuf for the receiver ring.
.It "rl0: no memory for tx list"
The driver failed to allocate an mbuf for the transmitter ring when
allocating a pad buffer or collapsing an mbuf chain into a cluster.

.Re
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
device driver first appeared in
.Fx 3.0 .
.Ox
support first appeared in
.Ox 2.5 .
.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Nm
driver was written by
.An Bill Paul Aq Mt wpaul@@ctr.columbia.edu .
.Sh BUGS
Since outbound packets must be longword aligned, the transmit
routine has to copy an unaligned packet into an mbuf cluster buffer
before transmission.
The driver abuses the fact that the cluster buffer
pool is allocated at system startup time in a contiguous region starting
at a page boundary.
Since cluster buffers are 2048 bytes, they are
longword aligned by definition.
The driver probably should not be
depending on this characteristic.
.Pp
The Realtek data sheets are of especially poor quality: the grammar
and spelling are awful and there is a lot of information missing,
particularly concerning the receiver operation.
One particularly important fact that the data sheets fail to mention
relates to the way in which the chip fills in the receive buffer.
When an interrupt is posted to signal that a frame has been received,
it is possible that another frame might be in the process of being
copied into the receive buffer while the driver is busy handling
the first one.
If the driver
manages to finish processing the first frame before the chip is done
DMAing the rest of the next frame, the driver may attempt to process
the next frame in the buffer before the chip has had a chance to finish
DMAing all of it.
.Pp
The driver can check for an incomplete frame by inspecting the frame
length in the header preceding the actual packet data: an incomplete
frame will have the magic length of 0xFFF0.
When the driver encounters this value, it knows that it has finished
processing all currently available packets.
Neither this magic value nor its significance are
documented anywhere in the Realtek data sheets.

.It "rl0: chip is in D3 power state -- setting to D0"
This message applies only to adapters which support power
management.
Some operating systems place the controller in low power
mode when shutting down, and some PCI BIOSes fail to bring the chip
out of this state before configuring it.
The controller loses all of its PCI configuration in the D3 state, so if
the BIOS does not set it back to full power mode in time, it won't be able
to configure it correctly.
The driver tries to detect this condition and bring the adapter back to the D0
(full power) state, but this may not be enough to return the driver to a fully
operational condition.
If this message appears at boot time and the driver fails to attach
the device as a network interface, a second warm boot will have to be
performed to have the device properly configured.
.Pp
Note that this condition only occurs when warm booting from another
operating system.
If the system is powered down prior to booting
.Ox ,
the card should be configured correctly.

- make configuration lines match GENERIC files
- more Xr (hopefully usefule Xr)
- never mention intro(4) on non-physical devices (i.e. protocols), always
mention it for physical devices
- random text style and quoting fixes
- drivers ported from FreeBSD did mention rc.conf instead of hostname.if as
the place to put mediaopt
- some .Tn UNIX -> .Ox replacements
- etc, etc...

out of this state before configuring it. The controller loses all of
its PCI configuration in the D3 state, so if the BIOS does not set
it back to full power mode in time, it won't be able to configure it
correctly. The driver tries to detect this condition and bring
the adapter back to the D0 (full power) state, but this may not be
enough to return the driver to a fully operational condition. If

important fact that the data sheets fail to mention relates to the
way in which the chip fills in the receive buffer. When an interrupt
is posted to signal that a frame has been received, it is possible that
another frame might be in the process of being copied into the receive
buffer while the driver is busy handling the first one. If the driver

this value, it knows that it has finished processing all currently
