.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm uath
.Nd Atheros USB IEEE 802.11a/b/g wireless network device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "uath* at uhub? port ?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver supports USB 2.0 wireless network devices based on Atheros
Communications fifth generation AR5005UG and AR5005UX chipsets.
.Pp
The AR5005UG chipset is made of an AR5523 multiprotocol MAC/baseband processor
and an AR2112 Radio-on-a-Chip that can operate between 2300 and 2500 MHz
(802.11b/g).
.Pp
The AR5005UX chipset is made of an AR5523 multiprotocol MAC/baseband processor
and an AR5112 dual band Radio-on-a-Chip that can operate between 2300 and
2500 MHz (802.11b/g) or 4900 and 5850 MHz (802.11a).
.Pp
The AR5005UG and AR5005UX chipsets both have an integrated 32-bit MIPS
R4000-class processor that runs a firmware and manages, among other things,
the automatic control of the transmit rate and the calibration of the radio.
.Pp
These are the modes the
.Nm
driver can operate in:
.Bl -tag -width "IBSS-masterXX"
.It BSS mode
Also known as
.Em infrastructure
mode, this is used when associating with an access point, through
which all traffic passes.
This mode is the default.
.It monitor mode
In this mode the driver is able to receive packets without
associating with an access point.
This disables the internal receive filter and enables the card to
capture packets from networks which it wouldn't normally have access to,
or to scan for access points.
.El
.Pp
.Nm
supports hardware WEP.
It can be typically configured in one of three modes:
no encryption; 40-bit encryption; or 104-bit encryption.
It is strongly recommended that WEP
not be used as the sole mechanism
to secure wireless communication,
due to serious weaknesses in it.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver can be configured at runtime with
.Xr ifconfig 8
or on boot with
.Xr hostname.if 5 .
.Sh FILES
The following firmware file is loaded when a device is plugged:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent -compact
.It /etc/firmware/uath-ar5523
.El
.Pp
This firmware file is not freely redistributable.
.Pp
A prepackaged version of the firmware can be installed using
.Xr fw_update 1 .

dhcp
.Ed
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "uath0: error N, could not read firmware ..."
For some reason, the driver was unable to read the firmware image from the
filesystem.
The file might be missing or corrupted.
.It "uath0: could not load firmware (error=...)"
An error occurred while attempting to upload the firmware to the onboard
MIPS R4000 processor.
.It "uath0: could not initialize adapter"
The firmware was uploaded successfully but did not initialize properly or
in time.
.It "uath0: could not send command 0xXX (error=...)"
An attempt to send a command to the firmware failed.
.It "uath0: timeout waiting for command reply"
A read command was sent to the firmware but the firmware failed to reply in
time.
.It "uath0: device timeout"
A frame dispatched to the hardware for transmission did not complete in time.
The driver will reset the hardware.
This should not happen.

@make -column lists pretty again;

specifically, rewrite them to permit some markup in the column headers,
and use "Ta" instead of literal tabs; mandoc does not currently match groff
100%, but a mandoc fix may be some time off, and we've gone enough releases
with poorly formatting column lists.

in some cases i have rewritten the lists as -tag, where -column made
little sense.

Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) is the de facto encryption standard
for wireless networks.
d66 4
a69 4
Unfortunately, due to serious weaknesses in WEP protocol
it is strongly recommended that it not be used as the
sole mechanism to secure wireless communication.
WEP is not enabled by default.
@


1.23
log
@as with other list types, column lists generally do not need a Pp/-compact
construct;

this also sidesteps what seems to be a problem with mandoc, in that
"-column -compact" seems to mess up the formatting. thus these pages should
now have their lists formatted nicely (i.e. correctly aligned and with indent
applied);

as a side note, the fact that headers are not properly marked up is another
issue which will be addressed separately (a mandoc fix is needed, i think).
i have fudged a few of these to mark up properly, since the workaround does
make sense for some pages.

as another side note, i haven;t fixed man7, as i need to prepare a separate
diff for kristaps and ingo.

@remove the CONFIGURATION section from the wireless pages:
the addition of the wpa options have shown just how unwieldy it had
become, it's already in ifconfig(8) anyway, and "ifconfig -m" will
get the relevant ones.

where
.Sq n
specifies which of the keys will be used for transmitted packets,
and the four keys,
.Dq k1
through
.Dq k4 ,
are configured as WEP keys.
If a set of keys is specified, a comma
.Pq Sq \&,
within the key must be escaped with a backslash.
Note that if multiple keys are used, their order must be the same within
the network.
.Nm
is capable of using both 40-bit (5 characters or 10 hexadecimal digits)
or 104-bit (13 characters or 26 hexadecimal digits) keys.

log
@Initial import of uath(4), a driver for Atheros USB2.0 AR5005UG/AR5005UX
chipsets.  Based on a black-box analysis of the Windows binary driver.
Requires a firmware that is not freely redistributable (see man uath).
The driver handles both pre- and post-firmware devices.

Still a bit experimental but Tx/Rx works great in BSS mode (on i386).
No 802.11a, IBSS, or HostAP modes yet but there's more to come.

Great thanks to jsg@@ for digging the USB IDs out of the Windows driver.

Committed over a D-Link DWL-G132.
