.Nd SMC91C9x and SMC91C1xx-based 10/100 Ethernet device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "sm0 at isa? port 0x300 irq 10"
.Cd "sm* at pcmcia?"
.Cd "nsphy* at mii?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
device driver supports SMC91C9x and SMC91C1xx-based Ethernet interfaces.
.Pp
The ISA attachment of the
.Nm
driver supports any SMC91C9x-based Ethernet interface on the ISA
bus, including the EFA Info*Express SVC VLB interface, and the
on-board SMC91C9x Ethernet found in many embedded PCs and laptop
docking stations.
.Pp
The PCMCIA attachment of the
.Nm
driver supports Megahertz X-JACK Ethernet cards, NewMedia BASICS Ethernet
cards, and SMC EtherEZ 8020 series cards.
.Sh MEDIA SELECTION
The SMC91C1xx supports the following media types:
.Bl -tag -width full-duplex
.It autoselect
Enable autoselection of the media type and options.
The user can manually override the autoselected mode by adding media options
to the appropriate
.Xr hostname.if 5
file.
.It 10baseT
Set 10Mbps operation.
The
.Ar mediaopt
option can also be used to select either
.Ar full-duplex
or
.Ar half-duplex
modes.
.It 100baseTX
Set 100Mbps (Fast Ethernet) operation.
The
.Ar mediaopt
option can also be used to select either
.Ar full-duplex
or
.Ar half-duplex
modes.
.El
.Pp
The SMC91C9x supports AUI and UTP media types:
.Pp
To enable the AUI media, select the
.Em 10base5
or
.Em aui
media type with
.Xr ifconfig 8 Ns 's
.Sq media
directive.
To select UTP, select the
.Em 10baseT
or
.Em utp
media type.
.Pp
For more information on configuring this device, see
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "sm0: unable to read MAC address from CIS"
This indicates that the Ethernet address, which is stored in the
CIS information on the Megahertz X-JACK PCMCIA Ethernet card, is
corrupted.

@Remove an OpenBSD-specific tweak regarding .Xr spacing
and make it compatible with bsd.lv mandoc and with groff-1.21.
This tweak was originally added for compatibility with groff-1.15,
which is no longer needed.

@First pass at removing clauses 3 and 4 from NetBSD licenses.

Not sure what's more surprising: how long it took for NetBSD to
catch up to the rest of the BSDs (including UCB), or the amount of
code that NetBSD has claimed for itself without attributing to the
actual authors.

@Incomplete section 4 mi manual page cleanup.
- make configuration lines match GENERIC files
- more Xr (hopefully usefule Xr)
- never mention intro(4) on non-physical devices (i.e. protocols), always
mention it for physical devices
- random text style and quoting fixes
- drivers ported from FreeBSD did mention rc.conf instead of hostname.if as
the place to put mediaopt
- some .Tn UNIX -> .Ox replacements
- etc, etc...
