All of these NICs are capable of 10, 100 and 1000Mbps speeds over CAT5
copper cable.
The DP83820 supports TBI (ten bit interface) and GMII
transceivers, which means it can be used with either copper or 1000baseX
fiber applications.
The DP83820 supports IPv4 receive IP/TCP/UDP checksum offload
as well as a 2048-bit multicast hash filter and up to 4 pattern match
buffers.

Most cards also use the DP83861 10/100/1000 copper Gigabit transceiver
chip, which supports autonegotiation of 10, 100 and 1000Mbps modes in

The DP83820 also supports Jumbo frames, which can be configured

The
.Nm
driver also supports one special link option for 1000baseT cards:
.Bl -tag -width full-duplex
.It Cm link0
With 1000baseT cards, establishing a link between two ports requires
that one port be configured as a master and the other a slave.
With autonegotiation,
the master/slave settings will be chosen automatically.
However when manually selecting the link state, it is necessary to
force one side of the link to be a master and the other a slave.
The
.Nm
driver configures the ports as slaves by default.
Setting the
.Cm link0
flag with
.Xr ifconfig 8
will set a port as a master instead.

.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "nge%d: couldn't map memory"
A fatal initialization error has occurred.
.It "nge%d: couldn't map ports"
A fatal initialization error has occurred.
.It "nge%d: couldn't map interrupt"
A fatal initialization error has occurred.
.It "nge%d: no memory for softc struct!"
The driver failed to allocate memory for per-device instance information
during initialization.
.It "nge%d: failed to enable memory mapping!"
The driver failed to initialize PCI shared memory mapping.
This might
happen if the card is not in a bus-master slot.
.It "nge%d: no memory for jumbo buffers!"
The driver failed to allocate memory for Jumbo frames during
initialization.
.It "nge%d: watchdog timeout"
The device has stopped responding to the network, or there is a problem with
the network connection (cable).

Most cards also use the DP83861 10/100/1000 copper gigabit transceiver

If the MTU is set to be larger than the NIC's transmit buffer
(typically 8152 bytes), hardware output checksumming is disabled
as the NIC cannot handle this case.

- more Xr (hopefully usefule Xr)
- never mention intro(4) on non-physical devices (i.e. protocols), always
mention it for physical devices
- random text style and quoting fixes
- drivers ported from FreeBSD did mention rc.conf instead of hostname.if as
the place to put mediaopt
- some .Tn UNIX -> .Ox replacements
- etc, etc...
