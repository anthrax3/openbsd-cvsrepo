.Cd "lc0 at isa? port 0x200"
.Cd "lc1 at isa? port 0x280"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
device driver supports DEC EtherWORKS III Ethernet interfaces, which
are based on the LEMAC Ethernet chip.
This includes the DE203, DE204, and DE205.
.Sh MEDIA SELECTION
The EtherWORKS III series supports various combinations of media, depending
on model.
Some models also support media autoselect.
Media is selected with
.Xr ifconfig 8 Ns 's
.Sq media
directive.

.Xr arp 4 ,
.Xr ifmedia 4 ,
.Xr intro 4 ,
.Xr isa 4 ,
.Xr netintro 4 ,
.Xr hostname.if 5 ,
.Xr ifconfig 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver first appeared in
.Nx 1.3 ,
.Ox
support was added in
.Ox 3.0 .
.Sh AUTHORS

by
.An Niklas Hallqvist Aq Mt niklas@@openbsd.org
.Sh BUGS
The
.Nm
does not currently support EISA LEMAC interfaces.

log
@Remove an OpenBSD-specific tweak regarding .Xr spacing
and make it compatible with bsd.lv mandoc and with groff-1.21.
This tweak was originally added for compatibility with groff-1.15,
which is no longer needed.

@First pass at removing clauses 3 and 4 from NetBSD licenses.

Not sure what's more surprising: how long it took for NetBSD to
catch up to the rest of the BSDs (including UCB), or the amount of
code that NetBSD has claimed for itself without attributing to the
actual authors.

@Incomplete section 4 mi manual page cleanup.
- make configuration lines match GENERIC files
- more Xr (hopefully usefule Xr)
- never mention intro(4) on non-physical devices (i.e. protocols), always
mention it for physical devices
- random text style and quoting fixes
- drivers ported from FreeBSD did mention rc.conf instead of hostname.if as
the place to put mediaopt
- some .Tn UNIX -> .Ox replacements
- etc, etc...
