.Sh NAME
.Nm urng
.Nd USB Random Number Generator devices
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "urng* at uhub?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for various true random number generator
(TRNG) devices connected via USB.
.Nm
reads raw entropy from the device at a (hardware dependent) interval
and stirs it into the system entropy pool with
.Xr add_true_randomness 9 .
.Sh HARDWARE
The following devices are supported by this driver:
.Bl -tag -width "Altusmetrum"
.It Araneus Alea II
Capable of delivering 100kbit/sec of hardware-generated entropy.
The product documentation states that the USB interface used by the
Alea II is the same as that used by its predecessor the Alea I;
theoretically this means that the Alea I should work but this has not
been tested.
.It Altusmetrum ChaosKey 1.0
This device is capable of providing entropy at 10Mbit/s.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver first appeared in
.Ox 6.2 .
.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Nm
driver was written by

1.1
log
@Add urng(4) which supports various USB RNG devices. Instead of adding one
driver per device, start bundling them into a single driver.

urng(4) supports the device currently supported by ualea(4) and adds support for
the Altusmetrum ChaosKey 1.0, by abieber@@

This was tested by abieber@@ with a ChaosKey and Sean Levy with an Alea II
