.Sh NAME
.Nm aps
.Nd ThinkPad Active Protection System accelerometer
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "aps0 at isa? port 0x1600"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for several sensors found in some ThinkPad laptops.
.Pp
The sensors currently exposed via the
.Xr sysctl 8
interface are:
.Bl -column "Keyboard Active" "Unknown" "Typical Use" -offset indent
.It Sy "Sensor" Ta Sy "Units" Ta Sy "Typical Use"
.It Li "X_ACCEL" Ta "Unknown" Ta "X Acceleration"
.It Li "Y_ACCEL" Ta "Unknown" Ta "Y Acceleration"
.It Li "X_VAR" Ta "Unknown" Ta "Weighted X Acceleration?"
.It Li "Y_VAR" Ta "Unknown" Ta "Weighted Y Acceleration?"
.It Li "Temp1" Ta "uK" Ta "Unknown"
.It Li "Temp2" Ta "uK" Ta "Unknown"
.It Li "Keyboard Active" Ta "boolean" Ta "Keyboard activity"
.It Li "Mouse Active" Ta "boolean" Ta "Mouse activity"
.It Li "Lid Open" Ta "boolean" Ta "Lid state"
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr isa 4 ,
.Xr sensorsd 8 ,
.Xr sysctl 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver first appeared in
.Ox 3.8 .
.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Nm
driver was written by
.An Jonathan Gray Aq Mt jsg@@openbsd.org .
.Sh CAVEATS
The
.Nm
driver does not yet maintain state and subsequently does not take
evasive action when it thinks the hard drive is in danger.
.Pp
The Y axis on X40 and possibly other models seems to be inverted.
It is unknown how to distinguish between different versions of the
accelerometer to compensate for this in the driver at this time.
.Pp
As IBM provides no documentation, it is not known what all the available
sensors are used for.

log
@make -column lists pretty again;

specifically, rewrite them to permit some markup in the column headers,
and use "Ta" instead of literal tabs; mandoc does not currently match groff
100%, but a mandoc fix may be some time off, and we've gone enough releases
with poorly formatting column lists.

in some cases i have rewritten the lists as -tag, where -column made
little sense.

1.1
log
@Start of a driver for the "Active Protection System" accelerometer
found in recentish ThinkPads.

Sensors are reported via hw.sensors in sysctl but sensor numbers
and presence is likely to change.  Units and use of all of the
sensors is not yet known as IBM has not released any documentation.

Driver is based on information reverse engineered from the windows
driver by Anurag Sharma and Mark Smith.
