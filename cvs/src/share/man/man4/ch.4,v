.Sh NAME
.Nm ch
.Nd SCSI media-changer (juke box) driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "ch? at scsibus?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for SCSI juke boxes.
It allows many slots of media to be multiplexed between a number of drives.
.Pp
A SCSI adapter and a logical scsibus must also be separately configured
into the system before a SCSI changer can be configured.
.Pp
As the SCSI adapter is probed during boot, the SCSI bus is scanned for devices.
Any devices found which answer as
.Qq Changer
type devices will be
.Dq attached
to the
.Nm
driver.
The first device found will be attached as
.Em ch0
and the next
.Em ch1 ,
etc.
It is also possible to specify what
.Nm
unit a device should come on-line as; refer to
.Xr scsi 4
for details on kernel configuration.
.\" .Sh IOCTLS
.\" The following
.\" .Xr ioctl 2
.\" call applies to the changer.
.\" It is defined in the header file
.\" .Aq Pa sys/chio.h .
.\" .Bl -tag -width DIOCSDINFO
.\" .It Dv CHIOOP
.\" This appears to be a
.\" .Dq do-everything
.\" call.

@Remove old FreeBSDisms:
- drop the "KERNEL CONFIGURATION" section which is confusing (these are
  not pseudo-devices!) except for st.4 where might be worth keeping.
- drop the "DISCLAIMER" section in ch.4.
- mention cdio and chio in cd.4 and ch.4 respectively.

.Sh KERNEL CONFIGURATION
In configuring, if an optional
.Ar count
is given in the specification, that number of SCSI media changers
are configured.
Most storage for them is allocated only when found
so a large number of configured devices is cheap (once the first
has included the driver).
.Sh IOCTLS
The following
.Xr ioctl 2
call applies to the changer.
It is defined in the header file
.Aq Pa sys/chio.h .
.Bl -tag -width DIOCSDINFO
.It Dv CHIOOP
This appears to be a
.Dq do-everything
call.

.Sh DISCLAIMER
These manpages were derived from the

documentation of the generic SCSI drivers.
Since naming and calling conventions may have diverged or suffered port
specific changes, please review the appropriate header files and configuration
file for your port.

log
@Incomplete section 4 mi manual page cleanup.
- make configuration lines match GENERIC files
- more Xr (hopefully usefule Xr)
- never mention intro(4) on non-physical devices (i.e. protocols), always
mention it for physical devices
- random text style and quoting fixes
- drivers ported from FreeBSD did mention rc.conf instead of hostname.if as
the place to put mediaopt
- some .Tn UNIX -> .Ox replacements
- etc, etc...

@- remove all trailing whitespace
     * except when it is escaped with a `\' at the end of the line
- fix remaining .Nm usage as well
- this is from a patch I received from kwesterback@@home.com, who has been
  working on some scripts for fixing formatting errors in mdoc'd man pages

Ok, so there could be a cost/benefit debate with this commit, but since I have
the patch we might as well commit it...

who apparently had such a device
however It appears as though no-one I have heard of has ever used this

Stefan appears to have suffered net.death (or at least net.disconnection).
I (julian) have never used this device. If you do please re-write this
