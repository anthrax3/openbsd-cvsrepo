.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm msts
.Nd Meinberg Standard Time String timedelta sensor
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "pseudo-device msts" Op Ar count
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This line discipline interfaces serial Meinberg devices.
.Pp
The line discipline is enabled by the following sequence:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
#include <sys/ioctl.h>
int ldisc = MSTSDISC, fildes; ...
ioctl(fildes, TIOCSETD, &ldisc);
.Ed
.Pp
The byte stream is unaltered by the line discipline which
maintains a timedelta sensor using the MSTS data.
The timedelta sensor will appear as msts* in the list of sensors and the delta
(in nanoseconds) between the received time information and the local time can
be accessed through the
.Xr sysctl 8
interface.
.Pp
The Meinberg radio clocks use the following default baudrates:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "GPS-receivers (external and PCI, COM0)XXX" -offset indent -compact
.It GPS-receivers (external and PCI, COM0)
19200/8N1
.It GPS-receivers (external, COM1)
9600/8N1
.It DCF77-receivers (external)
9600/7E2
.It DCF77-receivers (PCI)
4800/8N1
.El
.Sh SENSOR STATES
The quality of the timedelta is reported as the sensor status:
.Bl -tag -width "CRITICALXX" -offset indent
.It OK
The time information is valid.
The timedelta is safe to use for applications like
.Xr ntpd 8 .
.It WARN
The attached receiver has been indicating a warning condition
for at least the last ten minutes.
The timedelta should be used with care.
.It CRITICAL
tty timestamping has been turned on but there is no PPS signal present or the
receiver indicated a warning condition for at least the last twenty minutes.
Check your hardware.
Some receiver units need PPS to be manually turned on.
.El
.Pp
The status of a second sensor is used to report the status of the
device itself:
.Bl -tag -width "CRITICALXX" -offset indent
.It OK
The clock is synchronized, e.g. a GPS receiver has a fix.
.It WARN
The device issued a warning condition, e.g. a GPS receiver has no fix.

1.1
log
@Add support for the Meinberg Standard Time String format that all Meinberg
radio clocks can transmit over serial ports.  This is implemented as a
line discipline similar to nmea(4) and provides a timedelta sensor.

See http://www.meinberg.de/english/specs/timestr.htm for details on the
MSTS format.

ldattach(8) is extended to support the "msts" line discipline and two stopbits
(which some radio clocks, e.g. the C51 use).  Do a "make includes" before your
next system build.

Initially from Maurice Janssen based on nmea(4).  "go for it" deraadt
