.Sh NAME
.Nm yds
.Nd Yamaha DS-XG audio device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "yds* at pci? flags 0x0000"
.Cd "audio* at yds?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver supports Yamaha DS-XG based sound chips, as found in, e.g., many
Sony Vaio notebooks.
.Pp
The flags can be used to pass additional information
to the
.Nm
driver.
.Pp
A value of 0x1000 forces the driver to disable the Sound Blaster
legacy mode.
This is needed to make the floppy work on some machines
but is disabled by default because it is known to break
.Xr apm 4
support.
.Sh FILES
The driver needs a firmware file,
which is loaded on demand when the device is attached:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent -compact
.It Pa /etc/firmware/yds
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr ac97 4 ,
.Xr audio 4 ,
.Xr intro 4 ,
.Xr pci 4
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver first appeared in
.Ox 2.9 .
.Sh AUTHORS
.An -nosplit
.An Kazuki Sakamoto
and
.An Minoura Makoto .
