@First pass at removing clauses 3 and 4 from NetBSD licenses.

Not sure what's more surprising: how long it took for NetBSD to
catch up to the rest of the BSDs (including UCB), or the amount of
code that NetBSD has claimed for itself without attributing to the
actual authors.

.Dt UMIDI 4
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm umidi
.Nd USB MIDI devices
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "umidi* at uhub?"
.Cd "midi*  at umidi?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver supports USB MIDI devices that follow the USB MIDI standard.
It also supports the following vendor specific devices:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Dv -offset indent -compact
.It Tn Roland UM1
.It Tn Yamaha UX256
.It Tn Yamaha UX96
.It Tn other Yamaha MIDI devices (hopefully)
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver is accessible through the
.Xr midi 4
driver.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr midi 4 ,
.Xr uhub 4 ,
.Xr usb 4
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver
appeared in
.Ox 3.2 .
.Sh CAVEATS
Some USB MIDI devices provide a switch for selecting between
a vendor specific mode and standard USB MIDI mode.
Selecting standard USB MIDI mode may allow a device to attach as
.Nm
rather than
.Xr ugen 4 .
This is particularly true for Roland branded devices.
@


1.7
log
@suggest tweaking the "usb descriptor" switch (if any) if the device attaches
as ugen(4) rather than umidi(4).
