@Retire hp300, mvme68k and mvme88k ports. These ports have no users, keeping
this hardware alive is becoming increasingly difficult, and I should heed the
message sent by the three disks which have died on me over the last few days.

Noone sane will mourn these ports anyway. So long, and thanks for the fish.

.Sh NAME
.Nm wdsc
.Nd WD33c93 SCSI controller
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "wdsc* at hpc?                    " Pq sgi
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the Western Digital WD33c93 and WD33c93B SCSI
controllers.
.Pp
In addition to sending the required SCSI commands to
target devices on the SCSI bus, the
.Nm
driver deals with DMA, device interrupts, sync/async negotiation,
and target disconnects/reconnects.
.Sh DEVICE FLAGS
.Bl -tag -width "Bits XX-XX" -compact
.It Bits 0-7
Disable disconnect/reselect for the corresponding target
.It Bits 8-15
Disable synchronous negotiation for target "[bit - 8]"
.It Bits 16-23
Disable tagged queuing for target "[bit - 16]"
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
device flags may be OR'd together to enable any combination of
the features listed above.
Tape devices should be allowed to disconnect for the SCSI bus to operate
acceptably.
