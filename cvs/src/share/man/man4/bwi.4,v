.Sh NAME
.Nm bwi
.Nd Broadcom AirForce IEEE 802.11b/g wireless network device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "bwi* at cardbus?"
.Cd "bwi* at pci?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for Broadcom AirForce based
PCI/Cardbus network adapters.
.Pp
These are the modes the
.Nm
driver can operate in:
.Bl -tag -width "IBSS-masterXX"
.It BSS mode
Also known as
.Em infrastructure
mode, this is used when associating with an access point, through
which all traffic passes.
This mode is the default.
.It monitor mode
In this mode the driver is able to receive packets without
associating with an access point.
This disables the internal receive filter and enables the card to
capture packets from networks which it wouldn't normally have access to,
or to scan for access points.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver can be configured to use
Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) or
Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA-PSK and WPA2-PSK).
WPA is the current encryption standard for wireless networks.
It is strongly recommended that WEP
not be used as the sole mechanism
to secure wireless communication,
due to serious weaknesses in it.
The
.Nm
driver relies on the software 802.11 stack for both encryption and decryption
of data frames.
.Pp
The transmit speed is user-selectable or can be adapted automatically by the
driver depending on the received signal strength and on the number of hardware
transmission retries.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver can be configured at runtime with
.Xr ifconfig 8
or on boot with
.Xr hostname.if 5 .
.Sh FILES
The driver needs a firmware file which is loaded when an interface is
brought up:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent -compact
.It Pa /etc/firmware/bwi-airforce
.El
.\".Pp
.\"These firmware files are not free because Broadcom refuses
.\"to grant distribution rights.
.\"As a result, even though
.\".Ox
.\"includes the driver, the firmware files cannot be included and
.\"users have to download these files on their own.
.Pp
A prepackaged version of the firmware can be installed using
.Xr fw_update 1 .
.Sh HARDWARE
The following cards are among those supported by the
.Nm
driver:
.Bl -column "TRENDnet TEW-401PCplus" "BCM4306" "CardBus" "Standard" -offset 6n
.It Em Card Ta Em Chip Ta Em Bus Ta Em Standard
.It "Apple Airport Extreme" Ta BCM4306 Ta PCI Ta b/g
.It "Apple Airport Extreme" Ta BCM4318 Ta PCI Ta b/g
.It "ASUS WL-138g" Ta BCM4318 Ta PCI Ta b/g
.It "Buffalo WLI-CB-G54" Ta BCM4306 Ta CardBus Ta b/g
.It "Compaq R4035 onboard" Ta BCM4306 Ta PCI Ta b/g
.It "HP nx6125" Ta BCM4319 Ta PCI Ta b/g
.It "Linksys WPC54G Ver 3" Ta BCM4318 Ta CardBus Ta b/g
.It "Linksys WPC54GS Ver 2" Ta BCM4318 Ta CardBus Ta b/g
.It "TRENDnet TEW-401PCplus" Ta BCM4306 Ta CardBus Ta b/g
.It "US Robotics 5411" Ta BCM4318 Ta CardBus Ta b/g
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following example scans for available networks:
.Pp
.Dl # ifconfig bwi0 scan
.Pp
The following
.Xr hostname.if 5
example configures bwi0 to join network
.Dq mynwid ,
using WPA key
.Dq mywpakey ,
obtaining an IP address using DHCP:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
nwid mynwid
wpakey mywpakey
dhcp
.Ed
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr arp 4 ,
.Xr cardbus 4 ,
.Xr ifmedia 4 ,
.Xr intro 4 ,
.Xr netintro 4 ,
.Xr pci 4 ,
.Xr hostname.if 5 ,
.\".Xr hostapd 8 ,
.Xr ifconfig 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver first appeared in
.Ox 4.3 .
.Sh AUTHORS
.An -nosplit
The
.Nm
driver was written for
.Dx
by
.An Sepherosa Ziehau
and ported to
.Ox
by
.An Jonathan Gray
and
.An Marcus Glocker .
.Sh CAVEATS
Some chips are incorrectly calibrated due to the lack of documentation,
which can slow the amount of traffic to the point of being unusable.
Furthermore this driver only supports firmware version 3.

@make -column lists pretty again;

specifically, rewrite them to permit some markup in the column headers,
and use "Ta" instead of literal tabs; mandoc does not currently match groff
100%, but a mandoc fix may be some time off, and we've gone enough releases
with poorly formatting column lists.

in some cases i have rewritten the lists as -tag, where -column made
little sense.

@as with other list types, column lists generally do not need a Pp/-compact
construct;

this also sidesteps what seems to be a problem with mandoc, in that
"-column -compact" seems to mess up the formatting. thus these pages should
now have their lists formatted nicely (i.e. correctly aligned and with indent
applied);

as a side note, the fact that headers are not properly marked up is another
issue which will be addressed separately (a mandoc fix is needed, i think).
i have fudged a few of these to mark up properly, since the workaround does
make sense for some pages.

as another side note, i haven;t fixed man7, as i need to prepare a separate
diff for kristaps and ingo.

are configured as WEP keys.
If a set of keys is specified, a comma
.Pq Sq \&,
within the key must be escaped with a backslash.
Note that if multiple keys are used, their order must be the same within
the network.
.Nm
is capable of using both 40-bit (5 characters or 10 hexadecimal digits)
