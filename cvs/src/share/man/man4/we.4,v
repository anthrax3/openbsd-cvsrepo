.Sh NAME
.Nm we
.Nd Western Digital/SMC WD80x3, SMC Elite Ultra, and SMC EtherEZ Ethernet device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "we0 at isa? port 0x280 iomem 0xd0000 irq 9"
.Cd "we1 at isa? port 0x300 iomem 0xcc000 irq 10"
.Cd "we* at isapnp?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
device driver supports Western Digital/SMC WD80x3, SMC Elite Ultra, and
SMC EtherEZ Ethernet cards.
.Sh MEDIA SELECTION
The ability to select media from software is dependent on the particular
model of WD/SMC card.
The following models support only manual configuration: WD8003S, WD8003E,
and WD8013EBT.
.Pp
Other WD/SMC 80x3 interfaces support two types of media on a single card.
All support the AUI media type.
The other media is either BNC or UTP being a transceiver.
Software cannot differentiate between BNC and UTP cards.
On some models, the AUI port is always active.
.Pp
The SMC Elite Ultra and SMC EtherEZ interfaces support three media on
a single card: AUI, BNC, and UTP.
If the transceiver is active, the BNC media is selected.
Otherwise, the AUI and UTP ports are both active.
Cards of this vintage may also be found which lack one or two of the
connectors.
These cards also know what interrupt they are configured for, and will
correct such problems (for further interrupt issues, see
.Xr isa 4
and
.Xr pci 4 ) .
.Pp
The SMC EtherEZ does not yet work correctly in
.Xr isapnp 4
mode.
The SMC Elite Ultra does not work in
.Dq soft configuration
mode.
.Pp
To enable the AUI media, select the
.Em 10base5
or
.Em aui
media type with
.Xr ifconfig 8 Ns 's
.Sq media
directive.
To select the other media (transceiver), select the
.Em 10base2
or
.Em bnc
media type.
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "we0: overriding IRQ <n> to <m>"
The IRQ specified in the kernel configuration file is different from that
found in the card's configuration registers.
The value in the kernel configuration file is being overridden by the one
configured into the card.
.It "we0: can't wildcard IRQ on a <model>"
The IRQ was wildcarded in the kernel configuration file, and the card is
a WD8003S, WD8003E, or WD8013EBT, which do not support software IRQ
configuration.
.It "we0: failed to clear shared memory at offset <off>"
The memory test was unable to clear the interface's shared memory
region.
This often indicates that the card is configured at a conflicting
.Em iomem
address.

@Remove an OpenBSD-specific tweak regarding .Xr spacing
and make it compatible with bsd.lv mandoc and with groff-1.21.
This tweak was originally added for compatibility with groff-1.15,
which is no longer needed.

@First pass at removing clauses 3 and 4 from NetBSD licenses.

Not sure what's more surprising: how long it took for NetBSD to
catch up to the rest of the BSDs (including UCB), or the amount of
code that NetBSD has claimed for itself without attributing to the
actual authors.

- more Xr (hopefully usefule Xr)
- never mention intro(4) on non-physical devices (i.e. protocols), always
mention it for physical devices
- random text style and quoting fixes
- drivers ported from FreeBSD did mention rc.conf instead of hostname.if as
the place to put mediaopt
