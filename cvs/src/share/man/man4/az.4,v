.Sh NAME
.Nm az
.Nd Aztech/PackardBell FM radio device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "az0   at isa? port 0x350"
.Cd "az1   at isa? port 0x358"
.Cd "radio* at az?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the Aztech/PackardBell radio cards.
.Pp
The Aztech/PackardBell cards are stereo FM tuners that can tune
in the 87.5-108.0 MHz range.
They are capable of reporting signal status
(tuned/not tuned, stereo/mono signal) and forcing audio output to mono.
.Pp
The card is based on the LM7001 chip; see
.Xr radio 4
for details.
.Pp
The Aztech cards use only one I/O port.
The I/O port is set by the driver to the value specified in the configuration
file.
The I/O port must be one of
0x350 and 0x358.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr intro 4 ,
.Xr isa 4 ,
.Xr radio 4 ,
.Xr radio 9
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
device driver appeared in
.Ox 3.0 .
.Sh AUTHORS
.An -nosplit
The
.Nm
driver was written by
.An Vladimir Popov Aq Mt jumbo@@narod.ru
and
.An Maxim Tsyplakov Aq Mt tm@@oganer.net .
The man page was written by
.An Vladimir Popov Aq Mt jumbo@@narod.ru .
.Sh BUGS
It is impossible to determine which frequency the card is tuned to.
Thus, the driver will report an internally stored value even if it is not
correct (changed by some program that uses direct port access).

log
@Incomplete section 4 mi manual page cleanup.
- make configuration lines match GENERIC files
- more Xr (hopefully usefule Xr)
- never mention intro(4) on non-physical devices (i.e. protocols), always
mention it for physical devices
- random text style and quoting fixes
- drivers ported from FreeBSD did mention rc.conf instead of hostname.if as
the place to put mediaopt
- some .Tn UNIX -> .Ox replacements
- etc, etc...
