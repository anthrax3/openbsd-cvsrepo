@Retire hp300, mvme68k and mvme88k ports. These ports have no users, keeping
this hardware alive is becoming increasingly difficult, and I should heed the
message sent by the three disks which have died on me over the last few days.

Noone sane will mourn these ports anyway. So long, and thanks for the fish.

.Nd MVME328, MVME328S and MVME328XT high performance SCSI controller
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "vs0 at vmes0 addr 0xffff9000 ipl 2"
.Cd "vs1 at vmes0 addr 0xffff9800 ipl 2"
.Cd "vs2 at vmes0 addr 0xffff4800 ipl 2"

.Cd "vs4 at vmes0 addr 0xffff7000 ipl 2"
.Cd "vs5 at vmes0 addr 0xffff7800 ipl 2"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
provides access to the Interphase 4210
.Sq Jaguar ,
4220 and 4220W
.Sq Cougar ,
also sold as the Motorola MVME328, MVME328S and MVME328XT
VME boards.
Depending on the version, these boards provide up to two
single-ended or differential, narrow or wide SCSI interfaces.
Dual-channel boards do not necessarily have channels of the same type.
On
.Sq Jaguar
boards, the
.Nm
driver cannot report whether a channel is single-ended or differential.
It is recommended to be very careful if the type of the channel is not
known with certitude.
.Ss MVME328 channel configuration
The following table lists the channel configuration for Motorola MVME328
boards.
.Bl -column "Model Number" "Single-ended" "Single-ended" -offset indent

.Ss MVME328S channel configuration
The following table lists the channel configuration for Motorola MVME328S
boards.

.It Sy "Model Number" Ta Sy "Channel 0" Ta Sy "Channel 1"

.El
.Sh HARDWARE CONFIGURATION
The card's base address
.Po
matching the
.Em addr
locator on the configuration line
.Pc
is defined through a set of jumpers on the card.
.Ss MVME328, MVME328S and Interphase 4210 jumper configuration
The card address is controlled with nine jumpers, labeled
.Dq JB1
on the board, near the fuse in a corner of the card.
They are contiguous to the
.Dq JA7
single jumper and
.Dq JA8
dual jumper, located immediately to the left of the
.Dq JB1
block.
.Pp
The only supported configurations are:
.Bl -column "xxxxxxxxx" "0xffffffff" "Configuration" -offset indent
.It Sy JB1 Ta Sy Address Ta Sy Configuration
.It Li "___X_XX__" Ta "0xffff9000" Ta "1st board"
.It Li "_____XX__" Ta "0xffff9800" Ta "2nd board"
.It Li "____XX_X_" Ta "0xffff4800" Ta "3rd board"
.It Li "_____X_X_" Ta "0xffff5800" Ta "4th board"
.It Li "___X___X_" Ta "0xffff7000" Ta "5th board"
.It Li "_______X_" Ta "0xffff7800" Ta "6th board"
.El
.Ss MVME328XT and Interphase 4220 and 4220W jumper configuration
The card address is controlled with two sets of eleven jumpers \(en
which label will depend on the card model and artwork revision.
These jumpers are located between the two VME P1 and P2 connectors.
With the card oriented so that the VME connectors are at the bottom,
the bottom row of eleven jumpers should have the leftmost jumper set
and the ten rightmost jumpers open.
.Pp
The only supported configurations for the top row are:
.Bl -column "xxxxxxxxxxx" "0xffffffff" "Configuration" -offset indent
.It Sy Jumpers Ta Sy Address Ta Sy Configuration
.It Li "___X_XX____" Ta "0xffff9000" Ta "1st board"
.It Li "_____XX____" Ta "0xffff9800" Ta "2nd board"
.It Li "____XX_X___" Ta "0xffff4800" Ta "3rd board"
.It Li "_____X_X___" Ta "0xffff5800" Ta "4th board"
.It Li "___X___X___" Ta "0xffff7000" Ta "5th board"
.It Li "_______X___" Ta "0xffff7800" Ta "6th board"

@make -column lists pretty again;

specifically, rewrite them to permit some markup in the column headers,
and use "Ta" instead of literal tabs; mandoc does not currently match groff
100%, but a mandoc fix may be some time off, and we've gone enough releases
with poorly formatting column lists.

in some cases i have rewritten the lists as -tag, where -column made
little sense.
