@Retire hp300, mvme68k and mvme88k ports. These ports have no users, keeping
this hardware alive is becoming increasingly difficult, and I should heed the
message sent by the three disks which have died on me over the last few days.

Noone sane will mourn these ports anyway. So long, and thanks for the fish.

.Cd "vmes0  at vme0"
.Cd "vmel0  at vme0"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides access to the VMEbus.
On MVME180 and MVME181 boards, it operates the VMEbus part of the
.Xr angelfire 4
device.
On MVME187 and MVME197 boards, it operates the VMEchip2 ASIC connected to the
.Xr pcctwo 4
PCCchip2 local bus controller.
On MVME188 boards, it operates the VMEbus part of the
.Xr syscon 4
device.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver exposes the D16 and D32 access spaces through the
.Nm vmes
and
.Nm vmel
drivers, respectively.
.Pp
The currently supported VMEbus drivers are:
