@Retire hp300, mvme68k and mvme88k ports. These ports have no users, keeping
this hardware alive is becoming increasingly difficult, and I should heed the
message sent by the three disks which have died on me over the last few days.

Noone sane will mourn these ports anyway. So long, and thanks for the fish.

.Sh NAME
.Nm dart
.Nd MC68681 or MC68692 dual UART
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "dart0 at angelfire0 offset 0x640000 ipl 5"
.Cd "dart0 at syscon0 offset 0x82000 ipl 3"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The MC68681 and MC68692 dual asynchronous receiver/transmitter
.Pq Tn DUART
component provides two serial ports, as well as a 16-bit programmable
counter/timer.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the two serial ports found onboard
MVME180, MVME181 and MVME188 systems.
.Pp
The
.Nm
serial ports have a two character buffer on the transmit path, and a four
character buffer on the receive path.
.Pp
The following link speeds are supported by the
.Nm
driver:
50, 75, 110, 134.5, 150, 200, 300, 600, 1050, 1200, 1800, 200, 2400, 4800,
7200, 9600, 19200 and 38400 bps.
.Pp
On MVME180 and MVME181, the counter/timer is used to provide the
scheduling clock, while on MVME188, the counter/timer is used to provide
the statistics clock.
