@Retire hp300, mvme68k and mvme88k ports. These ports have no users, keeping
this hardware alive is becoming increasingly difficult, and I should heed the
message sent by the three disks which have died on me over the last few days.

Noone sane will mourn these ports anyway. So long, and thanks for the fish.

i82596CA 32-bit
Local Area Network Coprocessor for
.Tn Ethernet .
.Pp
The i82596CA chip is integrated on both the
.Tn MVME187
and
.Tn MVME197
Single-Board Computers.

.Pp
Each of the host's network addresses
is specified at boot time with an
.Dv SIOCSIFADDR
.Xr ioctl 2 .
The
.Nm
interface employs the address resolution protocol described in
.Xr arp 4
to dynamically map between Internet and
.Tn Ethernet
addresses on the local network.

@Use the ``official'' description for the MVME3xx cards, and provide jumper
information for the 328S and 376. Also remove the media section for ethernet
drivers, which does not apply.

The available external connector depends on the P2 converter board.
In most cases either a BNC or AUI connector is provided.
.Pp
By default, the system will select the media type automatically, but the
.Xr ifconfig 8
command can be used to force the media selection.
The media types are shown below:
.Bl -tag -width "media autoselect" -offset indent
.It media autoselect
Attempt to autoselect the media type (default)
.It media 10base5
Use the AUI connector
.It media 10base2
Use the BNC connector
