@Retire hp300, mvme68k and mvme88k ports. These ports have no users, keeping
this hardware alive is becoming increasingly difficult, and I should heed the
message sent by the three disks which have died on me over the last few days.

Noone sane will mourn these ports anyway. So long, and thanks for the fish.

.Nd MVME376 AMD LANCE Ethernet device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "le0 at vmes0 addr 0xffff1200 ipl 3"
.Cd "le1 at vmes0 addr 0xffff1400 ipl 3"
.Cd "le2 at vmes0 addr 0xffff1600 ipl 3"

.Cd "le4 at vmes0 addr 0xffff5600 ipl 3"
.Cd "le5 at vmes0 addr 0xffffa400 ipl 3"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides access to the AMD 7990/LANCE-based Interphase 3207
.Sq Hawk ,
also sold as Motorola MVME376,
VME boards.
This in turn provides an interface to the
.Tn Ethernet
network.
.Sh HARDWARE CONFIGURATION
The card's base address
.Po
matching the
.Em addr
locator on the configuration line
.Pc
is defined through three sets of DIP switches,
.Dq SW1
and
.Dq SW2 ,
located in the middle of the board, near the space between the two
VME connectors, and
.Dq SW3 ,
closer to the AM7990DC chip at the bottom edge.
.Pp
The only supported configurations are:
.Bl -column "xxxxxxxx" "xxxxxxxx" "xxxxxxxx" "0xffffffff" -offset indent
.It Sy SW1 Ta Sy SW2 Ta Sy SW3 Ta Sy Address
.It Li "UUU_UU_U" Ta "U__U____" Ta "______U_" Ta "0xffff1200"

@make -column lists pretty again;

specifically, rewrite them to permit some markup in the column headers,
and use "Ta" instead of literal tabs; mandoc does not currently match groff
100%, but a mandoc fix may be some time off, and we've gone enough releases
with poorly formatting column lists.

in some cases i have rewritten the lists as -tag, where -column made
little sense.
