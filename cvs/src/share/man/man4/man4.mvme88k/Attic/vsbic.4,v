@Retire hp300, mvme68k and mvme88k ports. These ports have no users, keeping
this hardware alive is becoming increasingly difficult, and I should heed the
message sent by the three disks which have died on me over the last few days.

Noone sane will mourn these ports anyway. So long, and thanks for the fish.

.Sh NAME
.Nm vsbic
.Nd MVME327A SCSI and floppy controller
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "vsbic0 at vmes0 addr 0xffffa600 ipl 2"
.Cd "vsbic1 at vmes0 addr 0xffffa700 ipl 2"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver supports the SCSI interface of the Motorola MVME327A
SCSI and floppy VME controller.
The WD33C93 SCSI controller found on this board is not directly accessible;
instead, the
.Nm
driver runs SCSI commands through the MVME327A firmware interface.
.Sh HARDWARE CONFIGURATION
The card's base address
.Po
matching the
.Em addr
locator on the configuration line
.Pc
is defined through a block of eight jumpers, labeled
.Dq J5
on the board, near its center.
.Pp
With the card oriented with its faceplate at the bottom and the VME connectors
at the top, the supported configurations are:
.Bl -column "xxxxxxxx" "0xffffffff" -offset indent
.It Sy J5 Ta Sy Address Ta Sy Configuration
.It Li "_X_XX__X" Ta "0xffffa600" Ta "1st board"
.It Li "_X_XX___" Ta "0xffffa700" Ta "2nd board"

.Xr cd 4 ,
.Xr ch 4 ,
.Xr intro 4 ,
.Xr scsi 4 ,
.Xr sd 4 ,
.Xr st 4 ,
.Xr uk 4 ,
.Xr vme 4
.Sh BUGS
Due to firmware limitations, SCSI commands using command blocks larger than
12 bytes are not supported.
Therefore, only the first 2TB of SCSI disks are accessible.

@make -column lists pretty again;

specifically, rewrite them to permit some markup in the column headers,
and use "Ta" instead of literal tabs; mandoc does not currently match groff
100%, but a mandoc fix may be some time off, and we've gone enough releases
with poorly formatting column lists.

in some cases i have rewritten the lists as -tag, where -column made
little sense.
