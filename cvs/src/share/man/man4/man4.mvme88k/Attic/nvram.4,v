@Retire hp300, mvme68k and mvme88k ports. These ports have no users, keeping
this hardware alive is becoming increasingly difficult, and I should heed the
message sent by the three disks which have died on me over the last few days.

Noone sane will mourn these ports anyway. So long, and thanks for the fish.

.Sh NAME
.Nm nvram
.Nd Mostek MK48T0x battery-backed realtime clock
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "nvram0  at pcctwo0 offset 0xc0000" Pq MVME1x7
.Cd "nvram0  at syscon0 offset 0x80000" Pq MVME188
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the
Mostek MK48T02
.Pq on MVME188
or MK48T08
.Pq on MVME1x7
realtime clocks chips.
.Pp
In addition to the clock itself, these chips embed 2KB
.Pq MK48T02
or 8KB
.Pq MK48T08
of battery-backed memory, which is accessible through the special
.Pa /dev/nvram0
file.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width Pa -compact

.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr intro 4 ,
.Xr pcctwo 4 ,
.Xr syscon 4
.Sh CAVEATS
The last 8 bytes of the battery-backed memory contains the realtime clock
registers.
Writing to these locations will interfere with proper clock operation.
.Pp
The second half of the battery-backed memory (including the clock registers)
is reserved by Motorola for use by the BUG firmware to store its configuration
data.
The
.Nm
driver does not prevent access to this reserved part.
