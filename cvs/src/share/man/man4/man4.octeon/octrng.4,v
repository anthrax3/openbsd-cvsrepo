.Sh NAME
.Nm octrng
.Nd octeon random number generator
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "octrng* at iobus?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver supports the random number generator found on the CN50XX chip.
.Pp
After the 5 seconds it takes for the device to be initialized, the
.Nm
driver feeds the random subsystem's entropy pool 32 bits of data every
10 milliseconds through the
.Xr add_true_randomness 9
API.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr intro 4 ,
.Xr arc4random 9
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver first appeared in
.Ox 5.5 .
.Sh AUTHORS
.An -nosplit
The
.Nm
driver was written by
.An Paul Irofti Aq Mt pirofti@@openbsd.org .
