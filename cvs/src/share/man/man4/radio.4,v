.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "radio* at bktr?"
.Cd "radio* at fms?"
.Cd "radio* at udsbr?"
.Pp
.In sys/types.h
.In sys/ioctl.h
.In sys/radioio.h
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for various FM radio cards.
It provides an uniform programming interface layer above different underlying
radio hardware drivers.
.Pp
For radio tuner controlling there is a single device file available:
.Pa /dev/radio .
.Pp
The following
.Xr ioctl 2
commands are supported:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width indent -compact
.It Dv RIOCSSRCH (int)
This command assumes that a signal search is required and gives direction
of search to the driver \- 0 to search down and any non-zero value to search up.
.It Dv RIOCGINFO (struct radio_info)
.It Dv RIOCSINFO (struct radio_info)
Get or set the current hardware device information into the struct radio_info
structure.
.Bd -literal
struct radio_info {
	int	mute;
	int	volume;
	int	stereo;
	int	rfreq;	/* reference frequency */
	int	lock;	/* locking field strength */
	u_int32_t	freq;	/* in kHz */
	u_int32_t	caps;	/* card capabilities */
#define RADIO_CAPS_DETECT_STEREO	(1<<0)
#define RADIO_CAPS_DETECT_SIGNAL	(1<<1)
#define RADIO_CAPS_SET_MONO		(1<<2)
#define RADIO_CAPS_HW_SEARCH		(1<<3)
#define RADIO_CAPS_HW_AFC		(1<<4)
#define RADIO_CAPS_REFERENCE_FREQ	(1<<5)

	u_int32_t	chan;
	u_int32_t	chnlset;
};
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Va mute
field is a boolean.
.Pp
The
.Va volume
field holds the card volume information and can be at most 255.
.Pp
The
.Va stereo
field is a boolean.
.Pp
The
.Va rfreq
holds information about the card reference frequency (not all cards support
this feature).
.Pp
The
.Va lock
field holds information about the card locking field strength during
an automatic search for cards that support this feature.
.Pp
The
.Va freq
field is the frequency in kHz the card is tuned to.
.Pp
The
.Va tuner_mode
field is the current tuning mode of the tuner.
Valid modes are:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width indent -compact
.It Dv RADIO_TUNER_MODE_RADIO
The tuner operates in FM radio mode.
.It Dv RADIO_TUNER_MODE_TV
The tuner operates in TV mode.
.El
.Pp
The
.Va caps
field is read-only and describes the card capabilities.
The capabilities can have the following values:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width indent -compact
.It Dv RADIO_CAPS_DETECT_STEREO
The device can determine if it is tuned to a stereo signal.
.It Dv RADIO_CAPS_DETECT_SIGNAL
The device can determine if it is tuned or not.
.It Dv RADIO_CAPS_SET_MONO
The device is capable of forcibly setting its output to mono.
.It Dv RADIO_CAPS_HW_SEARCH
The device can do hardware search.
.It Dv RADIO_CAPS_HW_AFC
The device has an internal hardware automatic frequency control.
.It Dv RADIO_CAPS_REFERENCE_FREQ
The device allows changing the reference frequency of a received signal.
.It Dv RADIO_CAPS_LOCK_SENSITIVITY
The device allows changing the station lock sensitivity used during search
operation.
.It Dv RADIO_CARD_TYPE
Some cards have several different incarnations.
This allows the variant of the card to be determined.
Currently not used.
.El
.Pp
The
.Va info
field is read-only and describes the current state of the card \-
tuned/not tuned, stereo signal/mono signal.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width indent -compact
.It Dv RADIO_INFO_STEREO
Informs whether the device receives a stereo or mono signal.
.It Dv RADIO_INFO_SIGNAL
Informs whether the device receives a valid signal or noise.
.El
.Pp
The
.Va chan
holds the TV channel the card is tuned to.
.Pp
The
.Va chnlset
specifies the TV channel set currently being used.
The tuner uses the current channel set to derive the tuning frequency
from the channel number.
Western Europe is the default channel set.
The following is a list of valid channel sets:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width indent -compact
.It 1
U.S.A. Broadcast
.It 2
U.S.A. Cable IRC
.It 3
U.S.A. Cable HRC
.It 4
Western Europe
.It 5
Japan Broadcast
.It 6
Japan Cable
.It 7
Former U.S.S.R. and C.I.S. Countries
.It 8
Australia
.It 9
France
.El
.El
.Pp
Either
.Va freq
or
.Va chan
can be used to tune to FM radio stations or TV channels,
respectively.
Some devices may not support both functionalities.
.Sh CHIPSETS
The TEA5757; TEA5759 is a 44-pin integrated AM/FM stereo radio circuit.
The radio part is based on the TEA5712.
The TEA5757 is used in FM-standards in which the local oscillator frequency
is above the radio frequency (e.g. European and American standards).
The TEA5759 is the version in which the oscillator frequency is below
the radio frequency (e.g. Japanese standards).
To conform with the Japanese standards, it is necessary to set the flags' least
significant bit to 1.
The TEA5757; TEA5759 has a 25-bit read-write shift register.
The TEA5757 chips are used in
.Xr fms 4
cards.

LM700x is a frequency synthesizer IC.
The LM700x is programmed through a 24-bit write-only shift register.
The first 14 bits are frequency data.
The next 2 bits are LSI test bits, and should always be zero.
The next 4 bits are band data and time base data.
They can be programmed to force a given reference frequency, or they can be
set to zero and the next 3 bits can be used to set the reference frequency.
The final bit selects the divider selection, which is 1 for FM and 0 for AM.
The LM700x chips are used in
.Xr az 4

.Xr rt 4

@improve support for TV tuning via radio(4) by:
- adding a TV or radio mode flag to struct radio_info for radio(4)
  and a similar flag to struct TUNER for bktr(4) to make tuning
  mode explicit
- reporting the proper frequency when in TV mode
- documenting the mode flag and cleaning up some grammar

@Incomplete section 4 mi manual page cleanup.
- make configuration lines match GENERIC files
- more Xr (hopefully usefule Xr)
- never mention intro(4) on non-physical devices (i.e. protocols), always
mention it for physical devices
- random text style and quoting fixes
- drivers ported from FreeBSD did mention rc.conf instead of hostname.if as
the place to put mediaopt
- some .Tn UNIX -> .Ox replacements
- etc, etc...

You can have only one card of the same type.
For example, if you have two aztech FM tuners, the first card with jumper
set to port 0x358 and the second one - to 0x350, you can use only one
aztech card (in the kernel, that is) either with port 0x350 or 0x358.
Don't even try to compile support for the second card into the kernel.

.Cd option RADIO_TEA5759
a51 11
Philips Semiconductors released two almost identical chips TEA5757 and
TEA5759.
The TEA5757 is used in FM-standards in which the local oscillator frequency
is above the radio frequency (e.g. European and American standards).
The TEA5759 is the version in which the oscillator frequency is below
the radio frequency (e.g. Japanese standards).
The option
.Va RADIO_TEA5759
changes the algotithm of frequency calculation for the tea5757 based cards
to conform with the Japanese standards.
