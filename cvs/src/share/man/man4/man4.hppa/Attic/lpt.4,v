.Sh NAME
.Nm lpt
.Nd Printer port controller
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "lpt0 at gsc? irq 7"
.Pp
.Cd "lpt0 at isa? port" \&"IO_LPT1\&" irq 7
.Sh INTRODUCTION
Parallel port controller provides Centronics port for unidirectional
data communications
.Tn ( IEEE 1284 ) .
.Pp
The
.Nm
ports on
.Xr isa 4
comes in whole rainbow of flaivours.
The parallel port controller on
.Xr gsc 4
(core) bus comes in several chip implementations:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -compact -width WD16C552
.It WD16C552
contains both serial ports and a parallel port;
.It LASI
incorporated into the
.Xr lasi 4
megacell hyperchip.
.El
.Pp
In either case the bus interface is the same and compatible with
PC parallel ports.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr com 4 ,
.Xr gsc 4 ,
.Xr isa 4 ,
.Xr lasi 4
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver was originally developed by William F. Jolitz, TeleMuse.
The implementation for hppa port is using MI implementation of this
driver and first appeared in
.Ox 2.4 .

@o) We don't like .Pp before/after .Sh;
o) .Nm always has argument in .Sh SYNOPSIS;
o) We always closes .Bl and .Bd tags;

@Cleanup xrefs under SEE ALSO.  Specifically:

  - Sort xrefs by section, and then alphabetically.
  - Add missing commas between xref items.
  - Remove commas from the last xref entry.
  - Remove duplicate entries.
