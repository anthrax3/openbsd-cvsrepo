.Dt MEM 4 hppa
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm mem ,
.Nm kmem
.Nd memory files and memory controller
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "mem* at mainbus0 flags 0x0000"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver controls and restricts access to the systems memory
by the hardware buses and the processor.
.Pp
It also provides an interface to userland through the special files
.Pa /dev/mem
and
.Pa /dev/kmem .
Physical memory is accessed through
.Pa /dev/mem ,
while kernel virtual memory is accessed through
.Pa /dev/kmem .
Access to kernel virtual addresses not currently mapped to memory will fail.
On hppa, the physical memory range is always contiguous and starts at
address 0; kernel virtual memory begins at address 0 as well.
.Pp
The writeability of the
.Pa /dev/mem
and
.Pa /dev/kmem
special files are controlled by the system
.Xr securelevel 7 ,
in addition to the filesystem permissions.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /dev/kmem -compact
.It Pa /dev/mem
.It Pa /dev/kmem
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr securelevel 7
.Sh CAVEATS
On some systems featuring a
.Dq Viper
memory controller,
.Ox
may not configure bus arbitration correctly, causing the boot process
to freeze during either
.Nm
or
.Xr cpu 4
device probe.
.Pp
In this case, a different initialization strategy can be achieved by
setting
.Ar flags
to 0x0001
.Po
see
.Xr boot_config 8
for details
.Pc .

@Document /dev/{k,}mem as usual, as well as the mem0 attachment flags and why
one might want to use them; mdoc tweaks jmc, feedback from mickey as well.
