.Cd "rgephy*" at mii?
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for various Ethernet controllers based on the
Synopsis Designware GMAC core.

A20/A31 and Rockchip RK3288/RK3399 ARM SoCs.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports several media types, which are selected via the
.Xr ifconfig 8
command.
The supported media types are:
.Bl -tag -width "media" -offset indent
.It media autoselect
