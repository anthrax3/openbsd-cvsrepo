@Add an intermediate layer driver, cbus(4), to manage its own
interrupts of PC-9801 extension board slot bus (so-called 'C-bus') on
LUNA-88K2.

Existing pcex(4) is now attached at cbus(4), i.e.

cbus0 at mainbus0
pcex0 at cbus0

With this driver, some other PC-9801 boards might be supported on luna88k
in the (near?) future:-)

.Nd NEC PC-9801 extension board slot
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "pcex0 at cbus0"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The file
.Pa /dev/pcexmem
is an
.Xr mmap 2
capable interface to the memory area of the installed board at "NEC PC-9801
extension board slot" on LUNA-88K2.
Byte offsets in this file are interpreted as relative memory addresses
of the installed board.
The range should be between 0x0 and 0xffffff.
.Pp
The I/O port area of the installed board is accessed via the file
.Pa /dev/pcexio
in the same manner as
.Pa /dev/pcexmem .
The range should be between 0x0 and 0xffff.
.Pp
The following
.Xr ioctl 2
calls apply to
.Pa /dev/pcexmem
and
.Pa /dev/pcexio
in order to handle interrupts of this extension slot.
Currently 7 levels of interrupt (0 to 6) are supported.
.Bl -tag -width PCEX
.It Dv PCEXSETLEVEL Fa "u_int *"
Register the specified interrupt level with this driver to handle.
.It Dv PCEXRESETLEVEL Fa "u_int *"
Unregister the specified interrupt level with this driver.
.It Dv PCEXWAITINT Fa "u_int *"
Wait for the interrupt with the specified level.

@The pcexmem(4) and pcexio(4) should be attached on LUNA-88K2 only.

Actually, there seems to be no PC-9801 extension board slot on
'original' LUNA-88K.

1.1
log
@Add generic driver for "NEC PC-9801(*) extension board slot" on
LUNA-88K.

LUNA-88K{,2} has one or two slot(s) that can attach the extension
board designed for PC-9801.  This driver provides dedicated mmap(2)
and capability for waiting specified interrupt on that slot so that we
can use the extension board from userland program.

(*)PC-9801 is a Japanese popular personal computer, mainly used in
   1980-90's. (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NEC_PC-9801)
