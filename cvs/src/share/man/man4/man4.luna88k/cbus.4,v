log
@Add an audio driver, necsb(4), for NEC PC-9801-86 sound board on
cbus(4).

This work is based on the source code of NetBSD/pc98, an unofficial
NetBSD port for NEC PC-9801 series, written about 16 years ago.
Thanks to NetBSD/pc98 porting staff for their work, especially NAGAO
Tadaaki and N. Honda who wrote the original driver.

log
@Add an intermediate layer driver, cbus(4), to manage its own
interrupts of PC-9801 extension board slot bus (so-called 'C-bus') on
LUNA-88K2.

Existing pcex(4) is now attached at cbus(4), i.e.

cbus0 at mainbus0
pcex0 at cbus0

With this driver, some other PC-9801 boards might be supported on luna88k
in the (near?) future:-)
