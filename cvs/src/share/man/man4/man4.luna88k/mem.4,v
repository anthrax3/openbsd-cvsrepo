.Sh NAME
.Nm mem ,
.Nm kmem
.Nd memory files
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The file
.Pa /dev/mem
is an interface to the physical memory of the
computer.
Byte offsets in this file are interpreted as physical memory addresses.
Reading and writing this file is equivalent to reading and writing
memory itself.
An error will be returned if an attempt is made to reference
an offset outside of
.Pa /dev/mem .
.Pp
Kernel virtual memory is accessed via the file
.Pa /dev/kmem
in the same manner as
.Pa /dev/mem .
Only kernel virtual addresses that are currently mapped to memory are allowed.
.Pp
On the luna88k, physical memory is always contiguous;
kernel virtual memory begins at
.Ad 0x00000000 .
.Pp
Even with sufficient file system permissions,
these devices can only be opened when the
.Xr securelevel 7
is insecure or when the
.Va kern.allowkmem
.Xr sysctl 3
variable is set.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /dev/kmem -compact

.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr securelevel 7
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Pa /dev/mem
and
.Pa /dev/kmem
files appeared in
