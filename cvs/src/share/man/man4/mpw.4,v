.Sh NAME
.Nm mpw
.Nd MPLS pseudowire
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "pseudo-device mpw"
.Pp
.In sys/types.h
.In netmpls/mpls.h
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
interface is used to create an MPLS layer 2 tunnel between two points.
.Pp
A
.Nm
interface can be created at runtime using the
.Sy ifconfig Nm Ns Ar N Cm create
command or by setting up a
.Xr hostname.if 5
configuration file for
.Xr netstart 8 .
The interface itself can be configured with
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
.Pp
The supported pseudowire operation modes are
.Ql ethernet
and
.Ql ethernet-tagged .
The
.Ql ethernet
operating mode passes all Ethernet packets transparently through the
interface, meanwhile the
.Ql ethernet-tagged
requires that the client uses at least one VLAN to pass the traffic.
The
.Nm
interface labels, neighbor, encapsulation and administrative state are normally
configured by
.Xr ldpd 8 ,
but it is also possible to configure them manually.
The configuration information that will be used by the ioctl are
defined below:
.Bd -literal
#define IMR_TYPE_NONE                   0
#define IMR_TYPE_ETHERNET               1
#define IMR_TYPE_ETHERNET_TAGGED        2

#define IMR_FLAG_CONTROLWORD            0x1

struct ifmpwreq {
        uint32_t        imr_flags;
        uint32_t        imr_type; /* pseudowire type */
        struct          shim_hdr imr_lshim; /* local label */
        struct          shim_hdr imr_rshim; /* remote label */
        struct          sockaddr_storage imr_nexthop;
};
.Ed
.Pp
.Nm
interfaces support the following unique ioctls:
.Bl -tag -width "SIOCSETMPWCFG" -offset 3n
.It Dv SIOCSETMPWCFG
Configure mpw using the supplied configuration.
.It Dv SIOCGETMPWCFG
Report the mpw configuration.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
Create a pseudowire to neighbor 10.254.0.1 using Ethernet encapsulation
with local label 20 and encapsulate MPLS packets with label 21:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# ifconfig mpw5 neighbor 10.254.0.1 encap ethernet mpwlabel 20 21 up
.Ed
.Pp
Create a pseudowire to neighbor 10.254.0.3 using Ethernet encapsulation
with local label 30 and encapsulate MPLS packets with label 31 and
control-word:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# ifconfig mpw5 neighbor 10.254.0.3 encap ethernet mpwlabel 30 31 controlword
.Ed
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr hostname.if 5 ,
.Xr ifconfig 8 ,
.Xr ldpd 8 ,
.Xr netstart 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
kernel interface first appeared in
.Ox 5.8 .
.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Nm
driver was written by
.An Rafael Zalamena Aq Mt rzalamena@@openbsd.org .
