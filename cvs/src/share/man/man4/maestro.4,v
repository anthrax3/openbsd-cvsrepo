.Dt MAESTRO 4
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm maestro
.Nd ESS Maestro 1 and 2 audio device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "maestro* at pci?"
.Cd "audio* at maestro?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver supports ESS maestro 1, 2 and 2E, including OEM products that
identify as NEC Versa, or NEC VersaProNX VA26D, as long as they use
an AC'97 compliant codec, which is always the case, except for very
early models.
It does not support maestro 3 cards, which are entirely different and
supported by the
.Xr esa 4
driver.
.Pp
Maestro cards have direct support for 16 bit signed little-endian
mono and stereo, 8 bit signed and unsigned mono and stereo.
Other encodings are emulated in software.
Sampling range is 4000 - 48000 Hz, with roughly a 2 Hz resolution.
.Pp
Maestro cards have some DSP and Dolby Digital 5.1 hardware, but this driver
does not support it.
.Pp
Other functions of maestro cards (modem, joystick) are not supported.
.Pp
PCI interrupt sharing works, as long as other devices comply too.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr ac97 4 ,
.Xr audio 4 ,
.Xr esa 4 ,
.Xr intro 4 ,
.Xr pci 4
.Sh HISTORY
Maestro hardware information was gleaned from the
.Fx
and Linux OSS drivers.
.Sh AUTHORS
.An -nosplit
.An David Leonard
and
.An Marc Espie .
.Sh BUGS
Very old cards with a PT101 mixer component should have partial support, e.g.,
the mixer does not work.
.Pp
Recording should work soon.

@Incomplete section 4 mi manual page cleanup.
- make configuration lines match GENERIC files
- more Xr (hopefully usefule Xr)
- never mention intro(4) on non-physical devices (i.e. protocols), always
mention it for physical devices
- random text style and quoting fixes
- drivers ported from FreeBSD did mention rc.conf instead of hostname.if as
the place to put mediaopt
- some .Tn UNIX -> .Ox replacements
- etc, etc...
