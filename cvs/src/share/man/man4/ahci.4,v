.Sh NAME
.Nm ahci
.Nd Advanced Host Controller Interface for Serial ATA
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "ahci* at fdt?"
.Cd "ahci* at pci?"
.Cd "ahci* at jmb?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for Serial ATA controllers conforming to the
Advanced Host Controller Interface specification.
.Pp
Several AHCI capable controllers also provide a compatibility mode that
causes them to appear as a traditional ATA controller supported by
.Xr pciide 4 .
.Pp
Although
.Nm
controllers are actual ATA controllers, the driver emulates SCSI via a
translation layer.
.Pp
Setting the lowest bit (0x1) of the driver flags forces
.Nm
to negotiate SATA 1 (1.5 Gb/s) transfer speeds only.
It may be useful where higher speeds are unstable.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr intro 4 ,
.Xr jmb 4 ,
.Xr pci 4 ,
.Xr pciide 4 ,
.Xr scsi 4
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver first appeared in
.Ox 4.1 .
.Sh AUTHORS
.An -nosplit
The
.Nm
driver was written by
.An David Gwynne Aq Mt dlg@@openbsd.org
and
.An Christopher Pascoe Aq Mt pascoe@@openbsd.org .

@the start of a driver for ahci controllers. this does nothing but map the

is going into the tree so i can work on it.
