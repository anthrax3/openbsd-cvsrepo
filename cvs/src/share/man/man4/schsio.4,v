.Sh NAME
.Nm schsio
.Nd SMSC SCH311x LPC Super I/O
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "schsio* at isa? port 0x2e   flags 0x0000"
.Cd "schsio* at isa? port 0x4e   flags 0x0000"
.Cd "schsio* at isa? port 0x162e flags 0x0000"
.Cd "schsio* at isa? port 0x164e flags 0x0000"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the SMSC SCH3112, SCH3114, and SCH3116
ICs.
Among other things, the devices contain environment sensors, a watchdog
timer, and fan control.
The
.Nm
driver supports the environment sensors and the watchdog timer.
.Pp
The hardware provides the following sensors:
.Bl -column "Internal diode" "Units" "Typical" -offset indent
.It Sy "Sensor" Ta Sy "Units" Ta Sy "Typical use"
.It Li "Internal diode" Ta "uK" Ta "IC internal thermal diode"
.It Li "Remote diode 1" Ta "uK" Ta "External thermal diode"
.It Li "Remove diode 2" Ta "uK" Ta "External thermal diode"
.It Li "FAN1" Ta "RPM" Ta "Fan tachometer"
.It Li "FAN2" Ta "RPM" Ta "Fan tachometer"
.It Li "FAN3" Ta "RPM" Ta "Fan tachometer"
.It Li "+2.5V" Ta "uV" Ta "Voltage"
.It Li "+1.5V (Vccp)" Ta "uV" Ta "Voltage"
.It Li "+3.3V (VCC)" Ta "uV" Ta "Voltage"
.It Li "+5V" Ta "uV" Ta "Voltage"
.It Li "+12V" Ta "uV" Ta "Voltage"
.It Li "+3.3V (VTR)" Ta "uV" Ta "Voltage"
.It Li "+3V (Vbat)" Ta "uV" Ta "Voltage"
.El
.Pp
.Nm
provides the standard
.Xr watchdog 4
interface and may be used with
.Xr watchdogd 8 .
The watchdog timer may be configured to a value from 1 second to 255
minutes.
The watchdog timer has a resolution of 1 second in the timeout interval
1 to 255 seconds.
Outside this interval, the resolution is 1 minute.
.Pp
Note that the pin used for signalling the timer expiration is
configurable and may on some boards be intended for other uses than this.
Because of this, the chip may not by default be configured to use the
pin for watchdog operation.
To force the
.Nm
device to use the pin for watchdog operation, the driver may be
configured with an
.Xr autoconf 9
.Ar flags
setting of 0x0001.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver first appeared in
.Ox 4.5 .

The

driver was written by

1.1
log
@Add schsio(4), a driver for SMSC SCH311x LPC Super I/O ICs providing
environment sensors.  These are found at least on VIA Epia SN18000G
boards.

Not enabled at 0x162e and 0x164e because probing these may not be
safe according to kettenis (guess where my schsio is).

Much help from kettenis.  Input from const and fgs.
