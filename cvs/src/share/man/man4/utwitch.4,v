@within Rs/Re reference blocks, use %U instead of %O (or any other
variants) for URLs, allowing mandoc -Thtml to properly generate links;

(sendmail.8 changes are simply using Lk, which i somehow missed in previous)

ingo reminded me to verify that gnu groff recognises %U: 1.20.1 does not,
but 1.21 does;
