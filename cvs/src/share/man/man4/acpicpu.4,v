.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm acpicpu
.Nd ACPI processor power and performance state
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "acpicpu* at acpi?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for extracting processor power and performance
levels from ACPI tables.
This information is used to enter deeper CPU power states when idle,
and can be used to throttle processor speed to reduce
power usage and extend battery life through the
.Va hw.setperf
.Xr sysctl 3
mechanism.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr sysctl 3 ,
.Xr acpi 4 ,
.Xr cpu 4 ,
.Xr intro 4 ,
.Xr apmd 8 ,
.Xr sysctl 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver first appeared in
.Ox 3.9 .
.Sh AUTHORS
.An -nosplit
The
.Nm
driver was written by
.An Marco Peereboom Aq Mt marco@@openbsd.org .
CPU power state (C-state) support was added by
.An Philip Guenther Aq Mt guenther@@openbsd.org .
