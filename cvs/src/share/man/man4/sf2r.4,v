.Sh NAME
.Nm sf2r
.Nd SoundForte RadioLink SF16-FMR2 FM radio device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "sf2r0   at isa? port 0x384 flags 0x00"
.Cd "radio* at sf2r?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the SF16-FMR2 FM radio tuners.
.Pp
The SF16-FMR2 is a stereo FM tuner that can tune in the range
87.5 \- 108.0 MHz, report signal status on the current frequency, force
audio output to mono, perform hardware signal search, and has an internal
AFC.
.Pp
The card is based on the TEA5757 chip; see
.Xr radio 4
for details.
.Pp
The SF16-FMR2 cards take only one I/O port.
The I/O port is set by the driver to the value specified in the configuration
file and must be 0x384.
.Pp
The flags control the driver behavior.
For example, with flags 0x01 the driver
will assume that there is a TEA5759 chip.
.Pp
MediaForte made two variants of the SF16-FMR2 cards, the first one has
an internal amplifier (PT2254A chip) of the output sound, the second one
does not have such an amplifier.
The current driver supports both variants.

@Incomplete section 4 mi manual page cleanup.
- make configuration lines match GENERIC files
- more Xr (hopefully usefule Xr)
- never mention intro(4) on non-physical devices (i.e. protocols), always
mention it for physical devices
- random text style and quoting fixes
- drivers ported from FreeBSD did mention rc.conf instead of hostname.if as
the place to put mediaopt
- some .Tn UNIX -> .Ox replacements
- etc, etc...
