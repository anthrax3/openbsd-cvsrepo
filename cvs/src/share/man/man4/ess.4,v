@First pass at removing clauses 3 and 4 from NetBSD licenses.

Not sure what's more surprising: how long it took for NetBSD to
catch up to the rest of the BSDs (including UCB), or the amount of
code that NetBSD has claimed for itself without attributing to the
actual authors.

.Sh NAME
.Nm ess
.Nd ESS Technology AudioDrive family audio device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.\" .Cd "ess0   at isa? port 0x220 irq 5 drq 1 drq2 5"
.Cd "ess*   at isapnp?"
.\" .Cd "ess*   at ofisa?"
.Cd "audio* at ess?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the ESS 1788, 1888, 1887, and 888 AudioDrive
audio devices.
.Pp
The AudioDrive 1788 is a half-duplex device, while the 1888, 1887, and
888 are full-duplex.
All are capable of 8- and 16-bit audio sample recording and playback
at rates up to 44.1kHz.
.Pp
The AudioDrive takes 16 I/O ports.
The I/O port range, IRQ, and DRQ channels are set by the driver
to the values specified in the configuration file (or for isapnp or ofisa,
the values assigned from the firmware).
The I/O port base must be one of 0x220, 0x230, 0x240,
0x250.
The IRQ must be one of 5, 7, 9, 10 (or 15 on the 1887 only).
The first DRQ channel must be selected from 0, 1, 3.
The second DRQ channel (used for playback by the full-duplex 1888/1887, ignored
by the 1788) can additionally be set to 5.
If both DRQ channels are used they must be different.
.Pp
The joystick interface (if enabled) is handled by the
.Xr joy 4
driver.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr audio 4 ,
.Xr intro 4 ,
.\" .Xr isa 4 ,
.Xr isapnp 4 ,
.Xr joy 4 ,
.Xr sb 4
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
device driver appeared in
.Ox 2.2 .
.Sh BUGS
The AudioDrive devices have a SoundBlaster compatibility mode, and may
be detected by the SoundBlaster driver (see
.Xr sb 4 )
rather than the AudioDrive driver.
The workaround is to remove or disable the SoundBlaster driver from the kernel
configuration.

@Incomplete section 4 mi manual page cleanup.
- make configuration lines match GENERIC files
- more Xr (hopefully usefule Xr)
- never mention intro(4) on non-physical devices (i.e. protocols), always
mention it for physical devices
- random text style and quoting fixes
- drivers ported from FreeBSD did mention rc.conf instead of hostname.if as
the place to put mediaopt
- some .Tn UNIX -> .Ox replacements
- etc, etc...
