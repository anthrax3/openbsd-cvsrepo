.Nd JMicron JMC25x/JMC26x 10/100/Gigabit Ethernet device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "jme* at pci?"
.Cd "jmphy* at mii?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver supports PCI Express Ethernet adapters based on the JMicron
JMC260 10/100 and JMC250 10/100/Gigabit Ethernet chips.
The Ethernet portion of the JMC261 10/100 and
JMC251 10/100/Gigabit chips,
which incorporate a card reader,
is also supported.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports IPv4 receive/transmit IP/TCP/UDP checksum offload, IPv6
receive/transmit TCP/UDP checksum offload and VLAN tag insertion and
stripping.
.Pp
The following
.Ar media
types are supported:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width autoselect -compact
.It Cm autoselect
Enable autoselection of the media type and options.
.It Cm 10baseT
Set 10Mbps operation.
.It Cm 100baseTX
Set 100Mbps (Fast Ethernet) operation.
.It Cm 1000baseT
Set 1000Mbps (Gigabit Ethernet) operation (some models only).

1.1
log
@Add drivers for the JMicron JMC250/JMC260 Ethernet controllers
and JMicron JMP202/JMP211 Ethernet PHYs.

Written by Pyun YongHyeon for FreeBSD, ported to DragonFlyBSD
by Sepherosa Ziehau and then ported to OpenBSD by me.

Thanks once again to JMicron for supplying hardware and
information which made this possible.

Some cleanup still needs to be done, and checksum offload
needs to be sorted out, but the driver otherwise seems
to work great.  Comitted over a JMC250 card.
