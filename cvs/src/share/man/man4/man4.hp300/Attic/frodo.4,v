@Retire hp300, mvme68k and mvme88k ports. These ports have no users, keeping
this hardware alive is becoming increasingly difficult, and I should heed the
message sent by the three disks which have died on me over the last few days.

Noone sane will mourn these ports anyway. So long, and thanks for the fish.

is found on HP 9000/4xx series workstations,
as well as HP 9000/362 and HP 9000/382 workstations.
It provides four
.Xr apci 4
serial ports, the first one being used to connect the
Domain keyboard.
On system with ISA slots,
.Nm
also provides ISA interrupt logic.

@Identify HP 9000/362 and HP 9000/382 models, and attach frodo on them.
Model 382 can be identified with a unique MMUID value; model 362 is told
from model 360 by probing for the frodo chip. Their built-in frame buffer
is not supported at the moment.

Matching information derived from messages to the NetBSD mailing lists.

@Driver for the Apollo Domain keyboard and mouse, for the HP 9000/4xx series.

Claims the console keyboard if a keyboard is detected at boot time,
otherwise HIL is preferred (but due to wsmux both can be used simultaneously).
