@Your average hp300 manual page overhaul for the release:
- clean/rewrite frame buffer manual page, with correct names, and add hyper.
- add missing manual pages, mostly from NetBSD
- harmonize texts, rebalance .Bl lists, sprinkle useful .Xr

.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm tc
.Nd
.Tn HP98544
98550 ``Topcat'' and ``Catseye'' frame buffer
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This driver is for the
.Tn HP98544 ,
98545 and 98547 ``Topcat''
and
.Tn HP98548 ,
98549, and 98550 ``Catseye'' display cards.
This driver merely checks for the existence of the device
and does minimal set up, as it is expected the applications will initialize
the device to their requirements.
The Topcat and Catseye are nearly identical in common usage and only the
Topcat will be referred to from now on.
.Pp
The Topcat display cards are not user configurable.
If one is present on a
system, it will always have a frame buffer address of 0x200000 and a control
register address of 0x560000.
These are the
.Tn HP
series 300
.Tn ITE
(Internal
Terminal Emulator) defaults.
The device can also be used as a graphics output device.
.Pp
The
.Xr ioctl 2
calls supported by the
.Ox
system for the Topcat are:
.Bl -tag -width GRFIOCGINFO
.It Dv GRFIOCGINFO
Get Graphics Info
.Pp
Get info about device, setting the entries in the
.Ar grfinfo
structure, as defined in
.Aq Pa machine/grfioctl.h .
For the 98544 or 98549,
the number of planes should be 1, as they are monochrome devices.
The number of planes for a 98545 is 4, translating to 15 colors,
excluding black.
The 98547 and 98548 cards have 6 planes, yielding 63 colors and black.
The 98550 has 8 planes, yielding 255 colors and black.
The displayed frame buffer size for the 98549 and 98550 is 1280 x 1024,
for the others it is 1024 x 768.
.It Dv GRFIOCON
Graphics On
.Pp
Turn graphics on by enabling
.Tn CRT
output.
The screen will come on, displaying whatever is in the frame buffer,
using whatever colormap is in place.
.It Dv GRFIOCOFF
Graphics Off
.Pp
Turn graphics off by disabling output to the
.Tn CRT .
The frame buffer contents
are not affected.
.It Dv GRFIOCMAP
Map Device to user space
.Pp
Map in control registers and frame buffer space.
Once the device file is mapped, the frame buffer structure is accessible.
The frame buffer structure describing Topcat/Catseye devices is defined in
.Aq Pa machine/grf_tcreg.h .
.El
.Pp
For further information about the use of
.Xr ioctl 2
see the man page.

@More manpage cleaning:
- coherent .Xr
- fix or add .Cd lines, fix device nodes names, etc.
- put sections in right order
- coherent ``frame buffer'' spelling
- KNF code examples (open("foo",1) my ass)
- provide an hp300 specific sd(4) as hp300 does not use the regular scsi
  subsystem (...yet).
- .Bx -> .Ox whenever appropriate
- other various random sweeping

- fix remaining .Nm usage as well
- this is from a patch I received from kwesterback@@home.com, who has been
  working on some scripts for fixing formatting errors in mdoc'd man pages

Ok, so there could be a cost/benefit debate with this commit, but since I have
the patch we might as well commit it...
