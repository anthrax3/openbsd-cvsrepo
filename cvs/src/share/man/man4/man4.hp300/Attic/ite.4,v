@Switch OpenBSD/hp300 to wscons, still using on-board ROM fonts for now.

Main features:
- MI hil drivers, allowing live plug/unplug of devices, and the keyboard
  does not need to be at id 1 anymore.
- SGC bus support on 4xx models. SGC frame buffers are supported too, but
  not as console, though you can use them as a regular glass terminal if
  you run a getty on ttyC0. Currently not compiled-in, awaiting for an sti(4)
  fix to be commited.
- HP-UX compatibility interfaces are removed. grfinfo and hilinfo are removed.

X11 support is currently broken by these changes; X.org X11R6 support will
be available very soon.

Tested on hyperion and 4 different flavours of catseye/topcat/kathmandu; other,
older frame buffers (davinci, gatorbox and renaissance) could not been tested
but should work; please report any regression.

.Dt ITE 4 hp300
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm ite
.Nd
.Tn HP
Internal Terminal Emulator
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "ite* at grf?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Tn TTY
special files of the form
.Pa /dev/ttye?
are interfaces to the
.Tn HP ITE
for bit-mapped displays as implemented under
.Ox .
An
.Tn ITE
is the main system console on most
.Tn HP300
workstations and
is the mechanism through which a user communicates with the machine.
If more than one display exists on a system,
any or all can be used as
.Tn ITE Ns s
with the limitation that only the first
one opened will have a keyboard (since only one keyboard is supported).
.Pp
.Tn ITE
devices use the
.Tn HP-UX
.Sq Li 300h
.Xr termcap 5
or
.Xr terminfo 5
entries.
However, as currently implemented,
the
.Tn ITE
does not support the full range of
.Tn HP-UX
capabilities for this device.
Missing are multiple colors, underlining, blinking, softkeys,
programmable tabs, scrolling memory and keyboard arrow keys.
The keyboard does not have any of the international character
support of
.Tn HP Ns 's
.Tn NLS
system.
It does use the left and right
.Em extend char
keys as meta keys, in that it will set the eighth bit of the character code.
.Pp
Upon booting, the kernel will first look for an
.Tn ITE
device
to use as the system console
.Pq Pa /dev/console .
If a display exists at any hardware address, it will be the console.
.Pp
When activated as an
.Tn ITE
(special file opened),
all displays go through a standard initialization sequence.
The frame buffer is cleared,
the
.Tn ROM
fonts are unpacked and loaded into off-screen storage and
a cursor appears.
The
.Tn ITE
initialization routine also sets the colormap entry used to white.
Variable colors are not used, mainly for reasons of simplicity.
The font pixels are all set to 0xff and the colormap entry corresponding
to all planes is set to R=255, G=255 and B=255.
The actual number of planes used to display the characters depends
on the hardware installed.
Finally, if the keyboard
.Tn HIL
device is not already assigned to another
.Tn ITE
device, it is placed in ``cooked'' mode and assigned to this
.Tn ITE .
.Pp
On most systems,
a display is used both as an
.Tn ITE
.Pf ( Pa /dev/ttye?
aka
.Pa /dev/console )
and as a graphics device
.Pq Pa /dev/grf? .
In this environment,
there is some interaction between the two uses that should be noted.
For example, opening
.Pa /dev/grf0
will deactivate the
.Tn ITE ,
that is, write over whatever may be on the
.Tn ITE
display.
When the graphics application is finished and
.Pa /dev/grf0
closed, the
.Tn ITE
will be reinitialized with the frame buffer cleared and the
.Tn ITE
colormap installed.

@More manpage cleaning:
- coherent .Xr
- fix or add .Cd lines, fix device nodes names, etc.
- put sections in right order
- coherent ``frame buffer'' spelling
- KNF code examples (open("foo",1) my ass)
- provide an hp300 specific sd(4) as hp300 does not use the regular scsi
  subsystem (...yet).
- .Bx -> .Ox whenever appropriate
- other various random sweeping

o Fixed up device sections to matchg config.new
o Added /dev/cua* to FILES sections where sensible
o We don't have an RMP option since rbootd uses bpf
