@Retire hp300, mvme68k and mvme88k ports. These ports have no users, keeping
this hardware alive is becoming increasingly difficult, and I should heed the
message sent by the three disks which have died on me over the last few days.

Noone sane will mourn these ports anyway. So long, and thanks for the fish.

.Sh NAME
.Nm tvrx
.Nd HP98705 PersonalVRX
.Dq TigerShark
frame buffer
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "tvrx*      at dio?"
.Cd "wsdisplay* at tvrx?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The PersonalVRX frame buffer is an accelerated, high resolution
.Pq 1280x1024
external display, connected to a 98702 DIO-II interface board.
The external display is composed of one (66570) or two (66570 with 66571 option)
8-bit color frame buffer boards.
Other option boards for the PersonalVRX family include the 66572
.Sq Z-buffer ,
the
66573
.Sq Transform Engine and Scan
board, and the 66574
.Sq Colormap .
All models also have four overlay planes.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver provides a frame buffer abstraction to the
.Xr wscons 4
console framework.
.Pp
Currently, the driver can only use the overlay planes, and will run as an
unaccelerated 16 color frame buffer.
.Pp
2D acceleration is not available until the appropriate microcode has been
downloaded into the framebuffer control logic; unfortunately, neither
the microcode nor documentation about the download interface seem to be
available.
.Pp
The PersonalVRX devices can be configured using the 5 DIP switches selector on
the interface board to define the
.Dq select code .
The select code value is computed by adding 133 to the number made from the
five binary digits.
The default settings, with the two MSB switches set to 1 and the three LSB
switches set to 0, provide a select code of 157.

@I had the opportunity to glance at HP-UX's /etc/conf/graf/gr_98705.h, so
after hours of tinkering with my frame buffer debugger, here comes color
support for tvrx(4) - by making use of all overlay planes. Access to the
regular planes remains a mystery, and seems to require a download of
microcode into the board first. Still slightly better...
