@Retire hp300, mvme68k and mvme88k ports. These ports have no users, keeping
this hardware alive is becoming increasingly difficult, and I should heed the
message sent by the three disks which have died on me over the last few days.

Noone sane will mourn these ports anyway. So long, and thanks for the fish.

.Dd $Mdocdate: May 31 2007 $
.Dt ISABR 4 hp300
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm isabr
.Nd Frodo ISA bridge
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "isabr0 at frodo?"
.Cd "isa* at isabr?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides access to the ISA slot found in model
.Sq t
HP 9000/4xx workstations.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr frodo 4 ,
.Xr intro 4 ,
.Xr isa 4
.Sh CAVEATS
Interrupt numbers 0, 1, 2 and 8 are permanently masked on hp300 systems.
Therefore ISA devices should not configured to use them.
.Sh BUGS
ISA interrupts are not handled correctly.
Some devices cause the
.Xr frodo 4
chip to interrupt, but without any change in its status registers;
others will correctly interrupt, but
.Xr frodo 4
will not ack the interrupt, resulting in an interrupt storm.
.Pp
The 4-slot EISA bridge found in model
.Sq s
workstations is not supported yet.
