@Retire hp300, mvme68k and mvme88k ports. These ports have no users, keeping
this hardware alive is becoming increasingly difficult, and I should heed the
message sent by the three disks which have died on me over the last few days.

Noone sane will mourn these ports anyway. So long, and thanks for the fish.

.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm apci
.Nd Apollo utility chip serial communications interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "apci* at frodo?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver supports the non-keyboard 8250-like UART connected to the
.Xr frodo 4
Apollo utility chip.
The first UART is used to communicate with the Domain keyboard.
The second is the serial console port when the firmware is in Domain/OS
mode, and is mapped to select code 9 by the HP-UX firmware (except
on 425e models).
As such, the second UART is handled by the
.Xr dca 4
driver on all models but the 425e.
.Pp
There is no tty attached to the first UART as it lacks modem/flow
control and is directly connected to the keyboard connector.
.Pp
Input and output for each line may be set to one of the following baud rates:
50, 75, 110, 134.5, 150, 300, 600, 1200, 1800, 2400, 4800, 9600,
19200, or 38400.
.Sh FILES

.It Pa /dev/ttya[0-3]
.It Pa /dev/cuaa[0-3]
.El
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It apci0: silo overflow.
The single-character input
.Dq silo
has overflowed and incoming data has been lost.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr dnkbd 4 ,
.Xr frodo 4 ,
.Xr intro 4 ,
.Xr tty 4
.Sh BUGS
Much of the code in the
.Nm
driver could be shared with the
.Xr dca 4
driver.

is not supported at the moment.
