@Retire hp300, mvme68k and mvme88k ports. These ports have no users, keeping
this hardware alive is becoming increasingly difficult, and I should heed the
message sent by the three disks which have died on me over the last few days.

Noone sane will mourn these ports anyway. So long, and thanks for the fish.

log
@Switch OpenBSD/hp300 to wscons, still using on-board ROM fonts for now.

Main features:
- MI hil drivers, allowing live plug/unplug of devices, and the keyboard
  does not need to be at id 1 anymore.
- SGC bus support on 4xx models. SGC frame buffers are supported too, but
  not as console, though you can use them as a regular glass terminal if
  you run a getty on ttyC0. Currently not compiled-in, awaiting for an sti(4)
  fix to be commited.
- HP-UX compatibility interfaces are removed. grfinfo and hilinfo are removed.

X11 support is currently broken by these changes; X.org X11R6 support will
be available very soon.

Tested on hyperion and 4 different flavours of catseye/topcat/kathmandu; other,
older frame buffers (davinci, gatorbox and renaissance) could not been tested
but should work; please report any regression.
