.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm cons
.Nd
.Tn HP300
console interface
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This release supports a
.Dq virtual
console device used for
.Em kernel printf
messages and accessed in user mode via
.Pa /dev/console .
It is virtual in the sense that it is attached to a hardware interface
at boot time.
Currently the choices are limited to:
a bit-mapped display
.Pq Xr grf 4
acting as an
.Em Internal Terminal Emulator
.Pq Tn ITE ,
a serial interface
.Pq Xr apci 4 \ or Xr dca 4 ,
or a null console, in that order.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /dev/console
.It Pa /dev/console
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr apci 4 ,
.Xr dca 4 ,
.Xr grf 4 ,
.Xr intro 4 ,
.Xr ite 4 ,
.Xr tty 4 ,
.Xr reboot 8
.Sh BUGS
.\" option CONSCODE="#" does this, but does not work on apci - needs to be
.\" fixed first.
It should be possible to specify potential console devices at
.Xr config 8
time.

@Your average hp300 manual page overhaul for the release:
- clean/rewrite frame buffer manual page, with correct names, and add hyper.
- add missing manual pages, mostly from NetBSD
- harmonize texts, rebalance .Bl lists, sprinkle useful .Xr

@More manpage cleaning:
- coherent .Xr
- fix or add .Cd lines, fix device nodes names, etc.
- put sections in right order
- coherent ``frame buffer'' spelling
- KNF code examples (open("foo",1) my ass)
- provide an hp300 specific sd(4) as hp300 does not use the regular scsi
  subsystem (...yet).
- .Bx -> .Ox whenever appropriate
- other various random sweeping

@o Minor updates from 4.4BSD
o Renamed rd.4 -> hd.4 since OpenBSD calls this device hd, not rd
o Fixed up device sections to matchg config.new
o Added /dev/cua* to FILES sections where sensible
o We don't have an RMP option since rbootd uses bpf
o A few other minor wording fixes
