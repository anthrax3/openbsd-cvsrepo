@Retire hp300, mvme68k and mvme88k ports. These ports have no users, keeping
this hardware alive is becoming increasingly difficult, and I should heed the
message sent by the three disks which have died on me over the last few days.

Noone sane will mourn these ports anyway. So long, and thanks for the fish.

@I had the opportunity to glance at HP-UX's /etc/conf/graf/gr_98705.h, so
after hours of tinkering with my frame buffer debugger, here comes color
support for tvrx(4) - by making use of all overlay planes. Access to the
regular planes remains a mystery, and seems to require a download of
microcode into the board first. Still slightly better...

@Work-in-progress driver for the HP ``Audio1'' device found on the HP 9000/425e
(hp300) and the HP9000/705 and 9000/710 (hppa). 8-bit mono, 8KHz, no surprise
since it is based upon a digital phone chip.
Tested on 425e only so far, and playback only; configured in, but disabled,
on hppa kernels until there are positive test reports (I am not sure the
interrupt assignment on hppa is correct).
And now people no longer can joke about audio on hp300.

@So, it turns out that models 362 and 382 built-in frame buffer only shows up
in DIO-II space, as a fat device spanning four select codes (i.e. 16MB of
memory). This is way too much for an at-most 2 Mpixel 8bit frame buffer, and
it turns out that this is because the device provides both a regular DIO-II
frame buffer (spanning two select codes) and a regular STI frame buffer
(spanning the other two select codes).
This commit introduces a straightforward sti@@dio attachment to get a working
sti(4) and wsdisplay(4) in a ridiculously small number of lines; however
the console code needs some changes to avoid duplicating globals.

While there, add sti@@dio support for the bootblocks, and I couldn't help
myself but clean the most rotten parts of them, and try to have them reuse
various files in sys/arch/hp300/dev instead of rolling their outdated ones.

Tested on a real 382 with the low-resolution frame buffer:
sti0 at dio0 scode 132: rev 8.02;129, ID 0x27134CB440A00499
sti0: 382V, 2048x512 frame buffer, 640x480x8 display
sti0: 8x16 font type 1, 16 bpc, charset 0-255
wsdisplay0 at sti0 mux 1: console (std, vt100 emulation)

Boot blocks updates tested on DIO-II 425t (serial/glass console), SGC 425e
(serial/glass console) and 382 (serial/glass console). And will be tested
on SGC 425t soon as well.

@First pass at removing clauses 3 and 4 from NetBSD licenses.

Not sure what's more surprising: how long it took for NetBSD to
catch up to the rest of the BSDs (including UCB), or the amount of
code that NetBSD has claimed for itself without attributing to the
actual authors.

@Switch OpenBSD/hp300 to wscons, still using on-board ROM fonts for now.

Main features:
- MI hil drivers, allowing live plug/unplug of devices, and the keyboard
  does not need to be at id 1 anymore.
- SGC bus support on 4xx models. SGC frame buffers are supported too, but
  not as console, though you can use them as a regular glass terminal if
  you run a getty on ttyC0. Currently not compiled-in, awaiting for an sti(4)
  fix to be commited.
- HP-UX compatibility interfaces are removed. grfinfo and hilinfo are removed.

X11 support is currently broken by these changes; X.org X11R6 support will
be available very soon.

Tested on hyperion and 4 different flavours of catseye/topcat/kathmandu; other,
older frame buffers (davinci, gatorbox and renaissance) could not been tested
but should work; please report any regression.
