@Retire hp300, mvme68k and mvme88k ports. These ports have no users, keeping
this hardware alive is becoming increasingly difficult, and I should heed the
message sent by the three disks which have died on me over the last few days.

Noone sane will mourn these ports anyway. So long, and thanks for the fish.

.Sh NAME
.Nm mem ,
.Nm kmem
.Nd memory files
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The file
.Pa /dev/mem
is an interface to the physical memory of the
computer.
Byte offsets in this file are interpreted as physical memory addresses.
Reading and writing this file is equivalent to reading and writing
memory itself.
An error will be returned if an attempt is made to reference
an offset outside of
.Pa /dev/mem .
.Pp
Kernel virtual memory is accessed via the file
.Pa /dev/kmem
in the same manner as
.Pa /dev/mem .
Only kernel virtual addresses that are currently mapped to memory are allowed.
.Sh HP300
On the
.Tn HP300 ,
the last byte of physical memory is always
.Li 0xFFFFFFFF .
Therefore, on an
.Tn HP300
with
8MB of memory, physical memory would start
at
.Li 0xFF800000 .
The kernel virtual memory runs from
.Li 0
to about
.Li 0x2400000 .
.Pp
Writeability of these devices is controlled by the system
.Xr securelevel 7 .
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /dev/kmem -compact
.It /dev/mem
.It /dev/kmem

@Your average hp300 manual page overhaul for the release:
- clean/rewrite frame buffer manual page, with correct names, and add hyper.
- add missing manual pages, mostly from NetBSD
- harmonize texts, rebalance .Bl lists, sprinkle useful .Xr

@o Minor updates from 4.4BSD
o Renamed rd.4 -> hd.4 since OpenBSD calls this device hd, not rd
o Fixed up device sections to matchg config.new
o Added /dev/cua* to FILES sections where sensible
o We don't have an RMP option since rbootd uses bpf
