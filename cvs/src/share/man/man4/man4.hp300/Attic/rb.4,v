@Your average hp300 manual page overhaul for the release:
- clean/rewrite frame buffer manual page, with correct names, and add hyper.
- add missing manual pages, mostly from NetBSD
- harmonize texts, rebalance .Bl lists, sprinkle useful .Xr

.Tn HP98720
``Renaissance'' frame buffer
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This driver is for the
.Tn HP98720
and 98721 graphics device, also known as
the Renaissance.
This driver has not been tested with all possible
combinations of frame buffer boards and scan boards installed in the device.
The driver merely checks for the existence of the device and does minimal set
up.
.Pp
The Renaissance can be configured at either the ``internal'' address
(frame buffer address 0x200000, control register space address 0x560000)
or at an external select code less than 32.
At the internal address it will be the ``preferred'' console device
(see
.Xr cons 4 ) .
The hardware installation manual describes the procedure for
setting these values.
.Pp
A user process communicates to the device initially by means of
.Xr ioctl 2
calls.
For the
.Tn HP-UX
.Xr ioctl 2
calls supported, refer to
.Tn HP-UX
manuals.
The
.Tn BSD
calls supported are:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Dv GRFIOCGINFO
Get Graphics Info
.Pp
Get info about device, setting the entries in the
.Ar grfinfo
structure, as defined in
.Aq Pa machine/grfioctl.h .
For the standard 98720, the number of planes should be 4.
The number of colors would therefore be 15, excluding black.
If one 98722A frame buffer board is installed, there will still
be 4 planes, with the 4 planes on the colormap board becoming overlay planes.
With each additional 98722 frame buffer board 4 planes will be added up to
a maximum of 32 planes total.
.It Dv GRFIOCON
Graphics On
.Pp
Turn graphics on by enabling
.Tn CRT
output.
The screen will come on, displaying
whatever is in the frame buffer, using whatever colormap is in place.
.It Dv GRFIOCOFF
Graphics Off
.Pp
Turn graphics off by disabling output to the
.Tn CRT .
The frame buffer contents
are not affected.
.It Dv GRFIOCMAP
Map Device to user space
.Pp
Map in control registers and frame buffer space.
Once the device file is mapped, the frame buffer structure is accessible.
The structure describing the 98720 is defined in
.Aq Pa machine/grf_rbreg.h .

.Sh EXAMPLES
This is a short segment of code showing how the device is opened and mapped
into user process address space assuming that it is grf0:
.Bd -literal
struct rboxfb *rbox;
u_char *Addr, frame_buffer;
struct grfinfo gi;
int disp_fd;

disp_fd = open("/dev/grf0", O_WRONLY);

if (ioctl(disp_fd, GRFIOCGINFO, &gi) < 0) return -1;

ioctl(disp_fd, GRFIOCON, 0);

if (ioctl(disp_fd, GRFIOCMAP, &Addr) < 0) {
	ioctl(disp_fd, GRFIOCOFF, 0);
	return -1;
}
rbox = (rboxfb *)Addr;                         /* Control Registers   */
frame_buffer = (u_char *)Addr + gi.gd_regsize; /* Frame buffer memory */
.Ed
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
None under
.Ox .
The
.Tn HP-UX
.Tn CE.utilities/Crtadjust
programs must be used.

Not tested for all configurations of scan board and frame buffer memory boards.

log
@More manpage cleaning:
- coherent .Xr
- fix or add .Cd lines, fix device nodes names, etc.
- put sections in right order
- coherent ``frame buffer'' spelling
- KNF code examples (open("foo",1) my ass)
- provide an hp300 specific sd(4) as hp300 does not use the regular scsi
  subsystem (...yet).
- .Bx -> .Ox whenever appropriate
- other various random sweeping

@o Minor updates from 4.4BSD
o Renamed rd.4 -> hd.4 since OpenBSD calls this device hd, not rd
o Fixed up device sections to matchg config.new
o Added /dev/cua* to FILES sections where sensible
o We don't have an RMP option since rbootd uses bpf
o A few other minor wording fixes
