@Retire hp300, mvme68k and mvme88k ports. These ports have no users, keeping
this hardware alive is becoming increasingly difficult, and I should heed the
message sent by the three disks which have died on me over the last few days.

Noone sane will mourn these ports anyway. So long, and thanks for the fish.

.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm autoconf
.Nd diagnostics from the autoconfiguration code
.Sh DESCRIPTION
When
.Ox
bootstraps it probes the innards of the machine
on which it is running
and locates controllers, drives, and other devices, printing out
what it finds on the console.
This procedure is driven by a system configuration table which is processed by
.Xr config 8
and compiled into each kernel.
Devices which exist in the machine but are not configured into the
kernel are not detected.
.Pp
Normally, the system uses the disk from which it was loaded as the root
filesystem.
If such a system is booted with the
.Dv RB_ASKNAME
option (see
.Xr reboot 2 ) ,
then the name of the root device is read from the console terminal at boot
time, and any available device may be used.

@autoconf(4) cleanup:
- remove blatant lies (missing diagnostics, unconfigured devices never
detected even on pci or such busses...)
- .Tn UNIX -> .Ox
- xref boot_`arch`(8) rather than boot(8) when boot(8) does not exist
- vague attempt to harmonize common texts

.Pp
Autoconfiguration on the
.Tn HP300 Ns s
is similar to that on the
.Tn VAX ,
the primary difference is in the naming conventions.
On the
.Tn HP300 ,
if devices exist which are not configured they will be ignored;
if devices exist of unsupported type they will be ignored.

If that is not possible,
a generic system will use
.Sq Li rd0
if it exists.

.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It CPU type not configured.
You tried to boot
.Tn UNIX
on a
.Tn CPU
type which it doesn't
(or at least this compiled version of
.Tn UNIX
doesn't) understand.
.Pp
.It hpib%d at sc%d, ipl %d.
An
.Tn HP-IB
was found at sc%d (the select code)
with ipl%d (interrupt priority level).
.Tn UNIX
will call it hpib%d.
.Pp
.It %s%d: %s.
.It %s%d at hpib%d, slave %d.
An
.Tn HP-IB
disk or tape controller was found.
For disks
.Ql %s%d
will look like
.Sq Li rd0 ,
for tapes like
.Sq Li ct0 .
The
.Ql %s
in the first line will be a product type like ``7945A'' or ``9144''.
The slave number comes from the address select switches on the drive.
.Pp
.It grf0 csr 0x560000
.It grf%d at sc%d
A bit mapped display was found either at the ``internal'' address (first case)
or at some ``external'' select code (second case).
If it exists, the internal display will always be unit 0.
.Pp
.It %s%d at sc%d, ipl %d flags %d
Another peripheral controller was found at the indicated select code
and with indicated interrupt priority level.
.Ql %s
will be one of
.Xr dca 4
(single-port serial interfaces),
.Xr dcm 4
(four-port serial interfaces), or
.Xr le 4
.Pf ( Tn LAN
cards).
The slave number comes from the address select switches on the interface card.

@o Minor updates from 4.4BSD
o Renamed rd.4 -> hd.4 since OpenBSD calls this device hd, not rd
o Fixed up device sections to matchg config.new
o Added /dev/cua* to FILES sections where sensible
o We don't have an RMP option since rbootd uses bpf
o A few other minor wording fixes
