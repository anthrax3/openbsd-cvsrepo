@Retire hp300, mvme68k and mvme88k ports. These ports have no users, keeping
this hardware alive is becoming increasingly difficult, and I should heed the
message sent by the three disks which have died on me over the last few days.

Noone sane will mourn these ports anyway. So long, and thanks for the fish.

cartridge tape interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "ct* at hpibbus?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The cartridge tape interface as found in the 7912, 7914, 7946, 9144, 9145,
and 88140 products provides a standard tape drive interface as described in
.Xr mtio 4
with the following exceptions:
.Bl -enum
.It
There is only one density.
.It
Only the
.Dq raw
interface is supported.
.It
The
.Dv MTIOCTOP
.Xr ioctl 2
is limited.
In particular, the command,
.Dv MTFSR
is not supported.
.It
The
.Dv MTIOCGET
.Xr ioctl 2
is not supported.
.It
The record size for read and write operations must be between
1K and 64K inclusive.
.El
.Pp
Special files
.Pa rct0
through
.Pa rct3
refer to rewind on close interfaces to drives 0 to 3.
Files
.Pa rct4
through
.Pa rct7
refer to no-rewind interfaces.
Files
.Pa rct8
through
.Pa rct11
refer to streaming rewind on close interfaces.
(Only 9144 type devices can stream.)
Lastly,
.Pa rct12
through
.Pa rct15
refer to streaming no-rewind interfaces.

@Replace the old 4.4BSD scsi code used on hp300 with a ``real'' driver
interfaced with the MI scsi code.

Adapted from NetBSD with some changes (especially to get tape and old

@More manpage cleaning:
- coherent .Xr
- fix or add .Cd lines, fix device nodes names, etc.
- put sections in right order
- coherent ``frame buffer'' spelling
- KNF code examples (open("foo",1) my ass)
- provide an hp300 specific sd(4) as hp300 does not use the regular scsi
  subsystem (...yet).
- .Bx -> .Ox whenever appropriate
- other various random sweeping
