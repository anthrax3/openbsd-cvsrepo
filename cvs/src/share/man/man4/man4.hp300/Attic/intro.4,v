@Retire hp300, mvme68k and mvme88k ports. These ports have no users, keeping
this hardware alive is becoming increasingly difficult, and I should heed the
message sent by the three disks which have died on me over the last few days.

Noone sane will mourn these ports anyway. So long, and thanks for the fish.

.Sh NAME
.Nm intro
.Nd introduction to special files and hardware support
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The manual pages in section 4 describe the special files,
related driver functions, and networking support
available in the system.
In this part of the manual, the SYNOPSIS section of
each configurable device gives a sample specification
for use in constructing a system description for the
.Xr config 8
program.
The DIAGNOSTICS section lists messages which may appear on the console
and/or in the system error log
.Pa /var/log/messages
due to errors in device operation;
see
.Xr syslogd 8
for more information.
.Pp
This section contains both devices
which may be configured into the system
and network related information.
The networking support is introduced in
.Xr netintro 4 .
.Sh DEVICE SUPPORT
This section describes the hardware supported on the
.Tn HP
9000/300 and 9000/400 series.
Software support for these devices comes in two forms.
A hardware device may be supported with a character or block
.Em device driver ,
or it may be used within the networking subsystem and have a
.Em network interface driver .
Block and character devices are accessed through files in the file
system of a special type; see
.Xr mknod 8 .
Network interfaces are indirectly accessed through the interprocess
communication facilities provided by the system; see
.Xr socket 2 .
.Pp
A hardware device is identified to the system at configuration time
and the appropriate device or network interface driver is then compiled
into the system.
When the resultant system is booted, the autoconfiguration facilities
in the system probe for the device and, if found, enable the software
support for it.
If a device does not respond at autoconfiguration
time it is not accessible at any time afterwards.
To enable a device which did not autoconfigure,
the system will have to be rebooted.
.Pp
The autoconfiguration system is described in
.Xr autoconf 4 .
A list of the supported devices is given below.
.Sh LIST OF DEVICES
The devices listed below are supported in this incarnation of
the system.
Pseudo-devices are not listed.
Devices are indicated by their functional interface.
Not all supported devices are listed.
.Pp
Occasionally, new devices of a similar type may be added
simply by creating appropriate table entries in the driver;
for example, new
.Tn CS/80
drives.

@I had the opportunity to glance at HP-UX's /etc/conf/graf/gr_98705.h, so
after hours of tinkering with my frame buffer debugger, here comes color
support for tvrx(4) - by making use of all overlay planes. Access to the
regular planes remains a mystery, and seems to require a download of
microcode into the board first. Still slightly better...

@Work-in-progress driver for the HP ``Audio1'' device found on the HP 9000/425e
(hp300) and the HP9000/705 and 9000/710 (hppa). 8-bit mono, 8KHz, no surprise
since it is based upon a digital phone chip.
Tested on 425e only so far, and playback only; configured in, but disabled,
on hppa kernels until there are positive test reports (I am not sure the
interrupt assignment on hppa is correct).
And now people no longer can joke about audio on hp300.

Claims the console keyboard if a keyboard is detected at boot time,
otherwise HIL is preferred (but due to wsmux both can be used simultaneously).

@Switch OpenBSD/hp300 to wscons, still using on-board ROM fonts for now.

Main features:
- MI hil drivers, allowing live plug/unplug of devices, and the keyboard
  does not need to be at id 1 anymore.
- SGC bus support on 4xx models. SGC frame buffers are supported too, but
  not as console, though you can use them as a regular glass terminal if
  you run a getty on ttyC0. Currently not compiled-in, awaiting for an sti(4)
  fix to be commited.
- HP-UX compatibility interfaces are removed. grfinfo and hilinfo are removed.

X11 support is currently broken by these changes; X.org X11R6 support will
be available very soon.

Tested on hyperion and 4 different flavours of catseye/topcat/kathmandu; other,
older frame buffers (davinci, gatorbox and renaissance) could not been tested
but should work; please report any regression.

- KNF code examples (open("foo",1) my ass)
- provide an hp300 specific sd(4) as hp300 does not use the regular scsi
  subsystem (...yet).
- .Bx -> .Ox whenever appropriate
- other various random sweeping

@Cleanup of the intro(4) manpages, suggested by ericj@@
Among other things:
- keep phrasing consistent across arches
- put "see also" and "history" sections at the end
- add history sections to i386 which lacks it
- name gdt and ubsec on i386 (.It nothing is bad)
- try to improve the nice look of the supported device list.
- remove "unsupported device" section (sparc only) and "supported systems"
  which is largealy out of date for, say, alpha, and completely off topic.
- correct /usr/adm/messages reference left in hp300 (gasp)
- provide intro(4) for sparc64.

Left to do:
- update supported device listings (even, create one for alpha).
- sprinkle .Tn macros where needed.

I wouldn't mind some help on this.

Software support for these devices comes in two forms.  A hardware
device may be supported with a character or block

autoconfiguration facilities in the system probe for the device
