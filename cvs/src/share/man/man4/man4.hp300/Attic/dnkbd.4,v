@Retire hp300, mvme68k and mvme88k ports. These ports have no users, keeping
this hardware alive is becoming increasingly difficult, and I should heed the
message sent by the three disks which have died on me over the last few days.

Noone sane will mourn these ports anyway. So long, and thanks for the fish.

.Dt DNKBD 4 hp300
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm dnkbd
.Nd Apollo Domain keyboard and mouse
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "dnkbd0   at frodo?"
.Cd "wskbd*   at dnkbd? mux 1"
.Cd "wsmouse* at dnkbd? mux 0"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver supports the first 8250-like UART connected to the
.Xr frodo 4
Apollo utility chip;
this UART is physically connected to the
.Sq Domain keyboard
connector.
The Apollo mouse plugs itself in a dedicated connector on the top left of
the keyboard.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver doesn't provide any direct entry point, but makes its functionality
available through the internal
.Xr wskbd 4
and
.Xr wsmouse 4
interfaces.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports all the keyboard layouts, which can be selected with
.Xr wsconsctl 8
(variable:
.Dq keyboard.encoding ) .
The layouts are:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent -compact
.It KB_DE
.Pq de
German with
.Dq dead accents .
.It KB_DK
.Pq dk
Norwegian/Danish with
.Dq dead accents .
.It KB_FR
.Pq fr
French.
.It KB_JP
.Pq jp
Japanese.
.It KB_SG
.Pq sg
Swiss German with
.Dq dead accents .
.It KB_SV
.Pq sv
Swedish/Finnish with
.Dq dead accents .
.It KB_UK
.Pq uk
UK English.
.It KB_US
.Pq us
US English (this is the default mapping).
.El
.Pp
All layouts with
.Dq dead accents
can be used in the KB_NODEAD
.Pq .nodead
variant.
This switches off the
.Dq dead accents .
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr apci 4 ,
.Xr frodo 4 ,
.Xr hilkbd 4 ,
.Xr hilms 4 ,
.Xr intro 4 ,
.Xr wskbd 4 ,
.Xr wsconsctl 8
.Sh CAVEATS
The Domain keyboard provides ten function keys, numbered
.Em F0
to
.Em F9 ,
while the common
.Ux
usage is to number them from
.Em F1
onwards.
To attempt minimizing confusion between the actual key labels and their
associated actions,
.Ox
assigns the
.Em F10
functionality to the
.Em F0
key, and the
.Em F1
to
.Em F9
functionality to the corresponding keys.
.Pp
Due to hardware peculiarities, it is not possible to remap the
.Sq Caps Lock
key as a modifier key, such as
.Sq Control .

@Caps Lock key is special, even in raw mode, on the Domain keyboard, exactly
like on ADB keyboards. Must have been the 80's keyboard fashion.

So when we see a Caps Lock event, produce the missing event as well for
acceptable behaviour.

This does not allow the Caps Lock key to be used for chording, though,
so document this in the manpage (honestly, Ctrl and Caps Lock being adjacent,
there is no point in swapping them on Domain keyboards, but you never know).
