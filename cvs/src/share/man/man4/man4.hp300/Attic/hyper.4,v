@Retire hp300, mvme68k and mvme88k ports. These ports have no users, keeping
this hardware alive is becoming increasingly difficult, and I should heed the
message sent by the three disks which have died on me over the last few days.

Noone sane will mourn these ports anyway. So long, and thanks for the fish.

.Sh NAME

.Tn HP A1096A
Hyperion frame buffer
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "hyper*     at dio?"
.Cd "wsdisplay* at hyper?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The Hyperion is a monochrome, high-resolution frame buffer.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver provides a frame buffer abstraction to the
.Xr wscons 4
console framework.
.Sh SELECT CODE
The
.Dq select code
for the Hyperion card can be set with the JP01 and JP02 jumpers.
These jumpers are located in the upper right corner of the board, when it is
placed component side up, with the video connector to the left.
Numbering the jumper pins from 1 to 3 from left to right,
the following combinations are available:
.Bl -column "JP02" "JP01" -offset indent
.It Sy "JP02" Ta Sy "JP01" Ta Sy "Select code"
.It Li "1-2" Ta "1-2" Ta 135
.It Li "1-2" Ta "2-3" Ta 134
.It Li "2-3" Ta "1-2" Ta "133 (factory settings)"
.It Li "2-3" Ta "2-3" Ta 132
.El
.Pp
Leaving a jumper open is equivalent to shorting pins 1 and 2.

@make -column lists pretty again;

specifically, rewrite them to permit some markup in the column headers,
and use "Ta" instead of literal tabs; mandoc does not currently match groff
100%, but a mandoc fix may be some time off, and we've gone enough releases
with poorly formatting column lists.

in some cases i have rewritten the lists as -tag, where -column made
little sense.

@Switch OpenBSD/hp300 to wscons, still using on-board ROM fonts for now.

Main features:
- MI hil drivers, allowing live plug/unplug of devices, and the keyboard
  does not need to be at id 1 anymore.
- SGC bus support on 4xx models. SGC frame buffers are supported too, but
  not as console, though you can use them as a regular glass terminal if
  you run a getty on ttyC0. Currently not compiled-in, awaiting for an sti(4)
  fix to be commited.
- HP-UX compatibility interfaces are removed. grfinfo and hilinfo are removed.

X11 support is currently broken by these changes; X.org X11R6 support will
be available very soon.

Tested on hyperion and 4 different flavours of catseye/topcat/kathmandu; other,
older frame buffers (davinci, gatorbox and renaissance) could not been tested
but should work; please report any regression.
