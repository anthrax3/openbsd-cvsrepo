@Retire hp300, mvme68k and mvme88k ports. These ports have no users, keeping
this hardware alive is becoming increasingly difficult, and I should heed the
message sent by the three disks which have died on me over the last few days.

Noone sane will mourn these ports anyway. So long, and thanks for the fish.

.Dt LE 4 hp300
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm le
.Nd AMD LANCE Ethernet device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "le* at dio?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm le
interface provides access to a 10 Mb/s Ethernet network via the
.Tn AMD
7990
.Tn LANCE
Ethernet chip set.
.Pp
The use of ``trailer'' encapsulation to minimize copying data on
input and output is supported by the interface but offers no advantage
due to the large
.Tn HP
page size.
The use of trailers is negotiated with
.Tn ARP .
This negotiation may be disabled, on a per-interface basis,
by setting the
.Dv IFF_NOTRAILERS
flag with an
.Dv SIOCSIFFLAGS
.Xr ioctl 2 .
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr arp 4 ,
.Xr ifmedia 4 ,
.Xr inet 4 ,

Each of the host's network addresses
is specified at boot time with an
.Dv SIOCSIFADDR
.Xr ioctl 2 .
The
.Nm
interface employs the address resolution protocol described in
.Xr arp 4
to dynamically map between Internet and Ethernet addresses on the local
network.
