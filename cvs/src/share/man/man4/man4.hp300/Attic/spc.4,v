@Retire hp300, mvme68k and mvme88k ports. These ports have no users, keeping
this hardware alive is becoming increasingly difficult, and I should heed the
message sent by the three disks which have died on me over the last few days.

Noone sane will mourn these ports anyway. So long, and thanks for the fish.

1.1
log
@Replace the old 4.4BSD scsi code used on hp300 with a ``real'' driver
interfaced with the MI scsi code.

Adapted from NetBSD with some changes (especially to get tape and old
cd-rom drives to not cause the driver to spin during probe).

Tested by millert@@ and I, ok millert@@
