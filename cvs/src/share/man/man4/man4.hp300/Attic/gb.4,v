@Your average hp300 manual page overhaul for the release:
- clean/rewrite frame buffer manual page, with correct names, and add hyper.
- add missing manual pages, mostly from NetBSD
- harmonize texts, rebalance .Bl lists, sprinkle useful .Xr

.Sh NAME

.Nd
.Tn HP98700
``Gatorbox'' frame buffer
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "gbox* at intio?"
.Cd "gbox* at dio? scode ?"
.Cd "grf* at gbox?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This driver is for the
.Tn HP98700
and 98710 graphics devices, also known as
the Gatorbox.
The term ``Gator'' will often be used, and it is not to be
confused with ``Gator'' used in reference to an
.Tn HP
9837 or 200/237 machine.
Also, the term Gatorbox is used for the 98700 alone, with the 98701 frame
buffer memory or with the 98710 accelerator installed.
This driver merely checks for the existence of the device and does minimal
set up, as it is expected the applications will initialize the device to their
requirements.
.Pp
The 98700 can be used as the only graphics device on a system, in which case
it will be used as the system console.
It can also be installed as a secondary display device.
For the first case, the
.Tn HP
.Tn 98287A M.A.D.
interface card
should be set to internal control space.
This will put the frame buffer at the DIO address 0x200000 and the control
registers at 0x560000.
At this address it will be the ``preferred'' console device (see
.Xr cons 4 ) .
For use as a secondary device,
the 98287A should be set to frame buffer address 0x300000,
and to an external select code.
.Pp
It should be noted that this configuration will conflict with the 98547
display card which has a 2 megabyte frame buffer starting at address 0x200000.
The 98700 should only be installed as a secondary device in a machine with a
1 bit 98544 display card or 4 bit 98545 card.
The
.%T 98700H Installation Guide
contains further configuration information.
.Pp
The
.Xr ioctl 2
calls supported by the
.Ox
system for the Gatorbox are:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Dv GRFIOCGINFO
Get Graphics Info
.Pp
Get info about device, setting the entries in the
.Em grfinfo
structure, as defined in
.Aq Pa machine/grfioctl.h .
For the standard 98700, the number of planes should be 4.
The number of colors would therefore be 15, excluding black.
With the 98701 option installed there will be another 4 planes for a total of 8,
giving 255 colors.
.It Dv GRFIOCON
Graphics On
.Pp
Turn graphics on by enabling
.Tn CRT
output.
The screen will come on, displaying whatever is in the frame buffer, using
whatever colormap is in place.
.It Dv GRFIOCOFF
Graphics Off
.Pp
Turn graphics off by disabling output to the
.Tn CRT .
The frame buffer contents
are not affected.
.It Dv GRFIOCMAP
Map Device to user space
.Pp
Map in control registers and frame buffer space.
Once the device file is mapped, the frame buffer structure is accessible.
The frame buffer structure describing the 98700
is given in
.Aq Pa machine/grf_gbreg.h .
.It Dv GRFIOCUNMAP
Unmap Device
.Pp
Unmap control registers and frame buffer space.
.Pp
For further information about the use of ioctl see the man page.

disp_fd = open("/dev/grf0", O_WRONLY);

ioctl(disp_fd, GRFIOCON, 0);

if (ioctl(disp_fd, GRFIOCMAP, &Addr) < 0) {
	ioctl (disp_fd, GRFIOCOFF, 0);
	return -1;
}
gbox = (gboxfb *)Addr;                         /* Control Registers   */
frame_buffer = (u_char *)Addr + gi.gd_regsize; /* Frame buffer memory */

.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
None under

log
@More manpage cleaning:
- coherent .Xr
- fix or add .Cd lines, fix device nodes names, etc.
- put sections in right order
- coherent ``frame buffer'' spelling
- KNF code examples (open("foo",1) my ass)
- provide an hp300 specific sd(4) as hp300 does not use the regular scsi
  subsystem (...yet).
- .Bx -> .Ox whenever appropriate
- other various random sweeping

@o Minor updates from 4.4BSD
o Renamed rd.4 -> hd.4 since OpenBSD calls this device hd, not rd
o Fixed up device sections to matchg config.new
o Added /dev/cua* to FILES sections where sensible
o We don't have an RMP option since rbootd uses bpf
o A few other minor wording fixes
