.Nd Adaptec AIC-6915 "Starfire" PCI 10/100 Ethernet device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "sf* at pci?"
.Cd "sqphy* at mii?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for Adaptec Duralink Fast Ethernet adapters
based on the Adaptec AIC-6915 "Starfire" chipset.
This includes the following:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -offset indent -compact
.It
ANA-62011 64-bit single port 10/100baseTX
.It
ANA-62022 64-bit dual port 10/100baseTX
.It
ANA-62044 64-bit quad port 10/100baseTX
.It
ANA-69011 32-bit single port 10/100baseTX
.It
ANA-62020 64-bit single port 100baseFX
.El
.Pp
The AIC-6915 is a bus master controller with an MII interface.
It supports high and low priority transmit and receive queues, TCP/IP
checksum offload, multiple DMA descriptor formats and both polling
and producer/consumer DMA models.
The AIC-6915 receive filtering options include a 16 entry perfect
filter, a 512-bit hash table for multicast addresses, a 512-bit hash
table for priority address matching and VLAN filtering.
An external MII-compliant transceiver is required for media interfacing.
.Pp
Multiport adapters consist of several AIC-6915 controllers connected
via a PCI to PCI bridge.
Each controller is treated as a separate interface by the
.Nm
driver.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media types:
.Bl -tag -width full-duplex
.It autoselect
Enable autoselection of the media type and options.
The user can manually override
the autoselected mode by adding media options to the
.Xr hostname.if 5
file.
.It 10baseT
Set 10Mbps operation.
The
.Ar mediaopt
option can also be used to select either
.Ar full-duplex
or
.Ar half-duplex
modes.
.It 100baseTX
Set 100Mbps (Fast Ethernet) operation.
The
.Ar mediaopt
option can also be used to select either
.Ar full-duplex
or
.Ar half-duplex
modes.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media options:
.Bl -tag -width full-duplex
.It full-duplex
Force full duplex operation.
.It half-duplex
Force half duplex operation.
.El
.Pp

.Xr ifconfig 8 .

The
.Nm
device driver first appeared in
.Ox 2.7 .
.Sh AUTHORS
.An -nosplit
The
.Nm
driver was written by
.An Jason R. Thorpe Aq Mt thorpej@@NetBSD.org
and ported to
.Ox
by
.An Martin Reindl Aq Mt martin@@openbsd.org .
.Sh BUGS
The
.Nm
driver does not support the IPv4/TCP/UDP checksum function of the AIC-6915.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver does not support the VLAN function of the AIC-6915.

- make configuration lines match GENERIC files
- more Xr (hopefully usefule Xr)
- never mention intro(4) on non-physical devices (i.e. protocols), always
mention it for physical devices
- random text style and quoting fixes
- drivers ported from FreeBSD did mention rc.conf instead of hostname.if as
the place to put mediaopt
- some .Tn UNIX -> .Ox replacements
- etc, etc...
