@Dynamically attach ommmc with fdt.  Offset the start of the memory region
by 0x100 for nodes compatible with "ti,omap4-hsmmc" to get the same
offsets as omap3.  Handle both the nintr 1 (omap3/am335x) and nintr 3
(omap4) cases in attach.  Ideally the "interrupts" property will be
handled by the interrupt controller drivers directly in future.
