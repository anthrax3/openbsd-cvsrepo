.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm amdisplay ,
.Nm nxphdmi
.Nd Texas Instruments AM335x LCD display driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm "amdisplay* at simplebus0"
.Nm "nxphdmi* at iic*"
.Nm "wsdisplay* at amdisplay*"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver supports the LCD controller integrated in Texas Instruments' line of
AM335x SoCs.
The LCDC reads a framebuffer from memory via DMA and scans it out
at the proper frequency to suit a display (along with the neccesary
hsync/vsync/etc. signals) to a PHY transmitter.
The BeagleBone Black uses NXP/Freescale's TDA19988 HDMI transmitter,
which is additionally supported by the
.Nm nxphdmi
driver.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr intro 4 ,
.Xr wsdisplay 4 ,
.Xr wsfb 4
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver first appeared in
.Ox 6.2 .
.Sh AUTHORS
.An -nosplit
The
.Nm
driver was written by
.An Ian Sutton Aq Mt ians@@openbsd.org .
The
.Nm nxphdmi
driver was written by
.An Oleksandr Tymoshenko Aq Mt gonzo@@freebsd.org
and later ported to
.Ox .
.Sh CAVEATS
On the BeagleBone Black, the LCDC and onboard eMMC NAND chip share the same set
of pads such that only one can be wired and used at a time.
To boot from or use the onboard storage, disable
.Nm
via
.Xr config 8
in the kernel.
.Pp
A display must be attached at boot time, otherwise
.Nm
will fail to configure.
.Pp
Hotplugging is not supported.
.Pp
Only 16-bit color depth is supported due to a silicon bug.
