.Sh NAME
.Nm wb
.Nd Winbond W89C840F 10/100 Ethernet device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "wb* at pci?"
.Cd "amphy* at mii?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for PCI Ethernet adapters and embedded
controllers based on the Winbond W89C840F Fast Ethernet controller chip.
This includes the TRENDnet TE100-PCIE and various other cheap boards.
The 840F should not be confused with the 940F, which is
an NE2000 clone and only supports 10Mbps speeds.
.Pp
The Winbond controller uses bus master DMA and is designed to be
a DEC "tulip" work-alike.
It differs from the standard DEC design
in several ways: the control and status registers are spaced 4
bytes apart instead of 8, and the receive filter is programmed through
registers rather than by downloading a special setup frame via
the transmit DMA engine.
Using an external PHY, the Winbond chip
supports both 10 and 100Mbps speeds in either full or half duplex.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media types:
.Bl -tag -width full-duplex
.It autoselect
Enable autoselection of the media type and options.
This is only supported if the PHY chip attached to the Winbond controller
supports NWAY autonegotiation.
The user can manually override
the autoselected mode by adding media options to the appropriate
.Xr hostname.if 5
file.
.It 10baseT
Set 10Mbps operation.
The
.Ar mediaopt
option can also be used to select either
.Ar full-duplex
or
.Ar half-duplex
modes.
.It 100baseTX
Set 100Mbps (Fast Ethernet) operation.
The
.Ar mediaopt
option can also be used to select either
.Ar full-duplex
or
.Ar half-duplex
modes.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media options:
.Bl -tag -width full-duplex
.It full-duplex
Force full duplex operation.
.It half-duplex
Force half duplex operation.
.El
.Pp
Note that the 100baseTX media type is only available if supported
by the adapter.
For more information on configuring this device, see
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "wb0: couldn't map memory"
A fatal initialization error has occurred.
.It "wb0: couldn't map interrupt"
A fatal initialization error has occurred.
.It "wb0: watchdog timeout"
The device has stopped responding to the network, or there is a problem with
the network connection (cable).
.It "wb0: no memory for rx list"
The driver failed to allocate an mbuf for the receiver ring.
.It "wb0: no memory for tx list"
The driver failed to allocate an mbuf for the transmitter ring when
allocating a pad buffer or collapsing an mbuf chain into a cluster.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
device driver first appeared in
.Fx 3.0 .
.Ox
support first appeared in
.Ox 2.5 .
.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Nm
driver was written by
.An Bill Paul Aq Mt wpaul@@ctr.columbia.edu .
.Sh BUGS
The Winbond chip seems to behave strangely in some cases when the
link partner switches modes.
If, for example, both sides are set to 10Mbps half-duplex, and the other end
is changed to 100Mbps full-duplex, the Winbond's receiver suddenly starts
writing trash all over the RX descriptors.
The
.Nm
driver handles this by forcing a reset of both the controller
chip and attached PHY.
This is drastic, but it appears to be the only way to recover properly from
this condition.

.It "wb0: chip is in D3 power state -- setting to D0"
This message applies only to adapters which support power management.
Some operating systems place the controller in low power
mode when shutting down, and some PCI BIOSes fail to bring the chip
out of this state before configuring it.
The controller loses all of its PCI configuration in the D3 state, so if the
BIOS does not set it back to full power mode in time, it won't be able
to configure it correctly.
The driver tries to detect this condition and bring
the adapter back to the D0 (full power) state, but this may not be
enough to return the driver to a fully operational condition.
If this message appears at boot time and the driver fails to attach
the device as a network interface, a second warm boot will have to be
performed to have the device properly configured.
.Pp
Note that this condition only occurs when warm booting from another
operating system.
If the system is powered down prior to booting
.Ox ,
the card should be configured correctly.

- random text style and quoting fixes
- drivers ported from FreeBSD did mention rc.conf instead of hostname.if as
