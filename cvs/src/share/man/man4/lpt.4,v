.Cd "# alpha/i386"

.Cd "# sparc64"
.Cd "lpt* at apio?"
.Cd "lpt* at ebus?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This driver provides access to parallel ports.
.Pp
The highest bit in the minor (bit 7, or add 128) number selects
whether to do polling or wait for interrupts.
If no IRQ is specified in the kernel configuration, or the IRQ specified is
not available at attach time, only the polling device may be used.
.Pp
The next lower bit (bit 6, or add 64) indicates the driver should
avoid initializing the printer.
.Pp
The next lower bit (bit 5, or add 32) requests that the driver do
automatic LF generation when printing CRs.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /dev/lpt0 -compact

first interrupt-driven parallel port device
.It Pa /dev/lpa0

log
@Incomplete section 4 mi manual page cleanup.
- make configuration lines match GENERIC files
- more Xr (hopefully usefule Xr)
- never mention intro(4) on non-physical devices (i.e. protocols), always
mention it for physical devices
- random text style and quoting fixes
- drivers ported from FreeBSD did mention rc.conf instead of hostname.if as
the place to put mediaopt
- some .Tn UNIX -> .Ox replacements
- etc, etc...
