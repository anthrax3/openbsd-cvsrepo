.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports IPv4 receive IP/TCP/UDP checksum offload and transmit IP/TCP
checksum offload, VLAN tag insertion and stripping,
as well as a 256-bit multicast hash filter.
The BCM5717, BCM5718, BCM5723, BCM5754, BCM5755, BCM5761, BCM5764, BCM5784,
BCM5785, BCM5787 and BCM577xx chips also support IPv6 receive TCP/UDP
checksum offload.
.Pp
The BCM5700, BCM5701, BCM5703, BCM5704, BCM5714, BCM5717, BCM5719, BCM5720,
BCM5762, BCM5780, BCM57765 and BCM57766
chips are capable of supporting jumbo frames.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media types:
.Bl -tag -width 1000baseSX
.It Cm autoselect
Enable autoselection of the media type and options.
The user can manually override
the autoselected mode by adding media options to the appropriate
.Xr hostname.if 5
file.
.It Cm 10baseT
Set 10Mbps operation.
The
.Xr ifconfig 8
.Ic mediaopt
option can also be used to select either
.Cm full-duplex
or
.Cm half-duplex
modes.
.It Cm 100baseTX
Set 100Mbps (Fast Ethernet) operation.
The
.Xr ifconfig 8
.Ic mediaopt
option can also be used to select either
.Cm full-duplex
or
.Cm half-duplex
modes.
.It Cm 1000baseT
Set 1000baseT operation over twisted pair.
Both
.Cm full-duplex
and
.Cm half-dupex
modes are supported.
.It Cm 1000baseSX
Set 1000Mbps (Gigabit Ethernet) operation.
Both
.Cm full-duplex
and
.Cm half-duplex
modes are supported.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media options:
.Bl -tag -width full-duplex
.It Cm full-duplex
Force full duplex operation.
.It Cm half-duplex
Force half duplex operation.
.El
.Pp
For more information on configuring this device, see
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS

.It "bge0: can't find mem space"
A fatal initialization error has occurred.
.It "bge0: couldn't map interrupt"
A fatal initialization error has occurred.
.It "bge0: watchdog timeout -- resetting"
The device has stopped responding to the network, or there is a problem with
the network connection (cable).

All of these NICs are capable of 10, 100 speeds over CAT5 copper cable;
the Gigabit controller chips also support 1000Mbps, except for the

Additional features may be provided via value-add firmware updates.
The BCM57xx supports TBI (ten bit interface) and GMII transceivers, which
means it can be used with either copper or 1000baseX fiber applications.
Note however the device only supports a single speed in TBI mode.

Most BCM5700-based cards also use the Broadcom BCM5401 or BCM5411 10/100/1000

The
.Nm
driver also supports one special link option for 1000baseT cards:
.Bl -tag -width link0
.It Cm link0
With 1000baseT cards, establishing a link between two ports requires
that one port be configured as a master and the other a slave.
With autonegotiation,
the master/slave settings will be chosen automatically.
However when manually selecting the link state, it is necessary to
force one side of the link to be a master and the other a slave.
The
.Nm
driver configures the ports as slaves by default.
Setting the
.Cm link0
flag with
.Xr ifconfig 8
will set a port as a master instead.

- make configuration lines match GENERIC files
- more Xr (hopefully usefule Xr)
- never mention intro(4) on non-physical devices (i.e. protocols), always
mention it for physical devices
- random text style and quoting fixes
- drivers ported from FreeBSD did mention rc.conf instead of hostname.if as
the place to put mediaopt
- some .Tn UNIX -> .Ox replacements
- etc, etc...
