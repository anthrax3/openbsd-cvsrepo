floppy interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "fd0 at fdc0 unit 0"
.Cd "fd1 at fdc0 unit 1"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This is an interface to the built-in and external floppy drives on the Atari.
Currently, there is no disklabel support for the floppy drives. Instead, the
floppy interface uses the partition number embedded in the minor device number
to distinguish between various floppy formats.
.Pp
Currently, the following formats are supported:
.Bl -column header Partition Size sides tracks sectors/track
.Sy    "Partition   Size   sides  tracks  sectors/track"
    a       360Kb    1      80          9
    b       720Kb    2      80          9
    c      1.44Mb    2      80         18
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /dev/rfd[01][abc] -compact
.It Pa /dev/fd[01][abc]
Block files
.It Pa /dev/rfd[01][abc]
Raw files
.El
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
None.
