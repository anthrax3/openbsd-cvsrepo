.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm arcofi
.Nd Siemens PSB2160 audio codec
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "arcofi* at gsc?"
.Cd "audio*  at arcofi?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver supports the HP
.Dq Audio1
audio devices, based upon the Siemens PSB2160
.Dq ARCOFI
codec, to implement the audio device interface described in
.Xr audio 4 .
.Pp
This device is found onboard HP 9000 workstations models 425e, 705 and 710.
.Pp
The
.Nm
is limited to a mono, 8000 KHz sound, either with 8-bit phone-quality mu-law or
a-law samples, or 16-bit signed linear samples in big-endian byte order.
.Ss AUDIOCTL SETTINGS
The following encodings are supported:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width AUDIO_ENCODING_SLINEAR_BE -offset indent -compact
.It Li AUDIO_ENCODING_ULAW
.It Li AUDIO_ENCODING_ALAW
.It Li AUDIO_ENCODING_SLINEAR_BE
Natively supported.
.Pp
.It Li AUDIO_ENCODING_SLINEAR
Software converted to
.Li AUDIO_ENCODING_ULAW
encoding.
.Pp
.It Li AUDIO_ENCODING_SLINEAR_LE
.It Li AUDIO_ENCODING_ULINEAR_LE
.It Li AUDIO_ENCODING_ULINEAR_BE
Software converted to
.Li AUDIO_ENCODING_SLINEAR_BE
encoding.
.El
.Ss MIXERCTL SETTINGS
The
.Nm
has three audio ports:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "outputs.lineXXX" -offset indent -compact
.It Cm inputs.line
The
.Sq line in
jack connector.
.It Cm outputs.line
The
.Sq line out
jack connector.
.It Cm outputs.spkr
The built-in speaker.
.El
.Pp
Each port has a volume control, and can be muted.
.Pp
The
.Cm outputs.line
and
.Cm outputs.spkr
volume settings are tied to the same hardware setting.

log
@Fix the documented CAVEAT by forcing the TX gain to minus infinity when
the user asks to only keep the input source enabled, and remember this
to keep reporting the previously configured volume values in mixerctl.
While there, document the supported encodings and the supported mixer items
in the manual page, and the fact that all output sources share the same
volume (GX gain) setting.

.Sh CAVEATS
Due to the
.Dq ARCOFI
chip being designed for phones, it is not possible to unmute the
.Sq line in
channel while muting
.Em all
output channels.
Attempting to do this will cause all channels (input and output) to be unmuted.

log
@Work-in-progress driver for the HP ``Audio1'' device found on the HP 9000/425e
(hp300) and the HP9000/705 and 9000/710 (hppa). 8-bit mono, 8KHz, no surprise
since it is based upon a digital phone chip.
Tested on 425e only so far, and playback only; configured in, but disabled,
on hppa kernels until there are positive test reports (I am not sure the
interrupt assignment on hppa is correct).
And now people no longer can joke about audio on hp300.
