.Sh NAME
.Nm dpt
.Nd DPT EATA SCSI RAID controller
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "dpt* at eisa?"
.Cd "dpt* at pci?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the following
.Tn SCSI
adapters:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent -compact
.It Tn DPT SmartCache III
.It Tn DPT SmartCache IV
.It Tn DPT SmartRAID III
.It Tn DPT SmartRAID IV
.El
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
None of these messages should be encountered under normal circumstances.
It should be noted that the list below is not complete.
.Bl -diag
.It dpt0: readcfg failed - see dpt(4)
The EATA configuration data did not appear upon request.
This may be caused by older firmware.
Generally the solution is to power-cycle the affected machine.
.It dpt0: spurious intr
A spurious interrupt was received from the HBA.
.It dpt0: bogus status (returned CCB id NNNN)
A corrupt or incomplete status packet was received from the HBA.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr cd 4 ,
.Xr ch 4 ,
.Xr eisa 4 ,
.Xr intro 4 ,
.Xr pci 4 ,
.Xr scsi 4 ,
.Xr sd 4 ,
.Xr st 4
.Sh HISTORY
This manpage is inadequate.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver first appeared in
.Ox 2.5 .
.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Nm
driver was written by
.An Andy Doran Aq Mt ad@@netbsd.org ,
based upon the
.Nm uha
and
.Nm bha
drivers, which are the work of others.
.Sh BUGS
EATA adapters other than listed may function correctly with the
.Nm
driver, however a definitive list is not available.
.Pp
Older firmware may prove problematic.
It is recommended that the latest available firmware be used.
Contact DPT for a firmware update.
.Pp
Older boards that do not support scatter-gather I/O or DMA are not supported.
.Pp
An ISA front-end is needed.
.Pp
ECC formatted disk and arrays (i.e., with a sector size of 528 bytes) do not
work correctly with the PM2041 and certain firmware revisions of the PM3334.
