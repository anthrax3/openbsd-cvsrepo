.Sh NAME
.Nm xnf
.Nd Xen Netfront networking interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "xnf* at xen?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for a paravirtual networking interface
.Dq Netfront
native to the Xen hypervisor.
.Pp
During attach the
.Nm
driver will ask the hypervisor to switch all configured virtual interfaces
over to the Netfront interface regardless of the VM configuration.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr autoconf 4 ,
.Xr intro 4 ,
.Xr xen 4
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver first appeared in
.Ox 5.9 .
.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Nm
driver was written by
.An Mike Belopuhov Aq Mt mikeb@@openbsd.org
from scratch, inspired by the
.Fx
implementation.

@All emulated networking interfaces are taken over by xnf(4) now

This follows the best practice and was brought to our attention by
Wei Liu <wei ! liu2 at citrix ! com>, thanks!  Implementation idea
from reyk@@.

.Sh IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
Both receive and transmit ring sizes are fixed at 256 entries due to
limitations of the interface.
.Pp
Currently
.Nm
will reassemble all packet chains consisting of more than 8 fragments
by calling
.Xr m_defrag 9 .
In case the chain still has more than 8 fragments, it will be dropped.
