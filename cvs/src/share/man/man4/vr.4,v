.Nd VIA Rhine I/II/III 10/100 Ethernet device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "vr* at pci?"
.Cd "amphy* at mii?"
.Cd "icsphy* at mii?"
.Cd "sqphy* at mii?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for PCI Ethernet adapters and embedded
controllers based on the VIA Technologies VT3043 Rhine I,
VT86C100A Rhine II, VT6102 Rhine II, and VT6105/VT6105M Rhine III
Fast Ethernet controller chips, including the following:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
AOpen/Acer ALN-320
.It
D-Link DFE-520TX, DFE-530TX
.It
Hawking Technologies PN102TX
.It
Soekris Engineering lan1741
.El
.Pp
The VIA Rhine chips use bus master DMA and have a software interface
designed to resemble that of the DEC 21x4x "tulip" chips.
The major differences are that the receive filter in the Rhine chips is
much simpler and is programmed through registers rather than by
downloading a special setup frame through the transmit DMA engine,
and that on older chips transmit and receive DMA buffers must be
longword aligned.
The Rhine chips are meant to be interfaced with external
physical layer devices via an MII bus.
They support both 10 and 100Mbps speeds in either full or half duplex.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver for the VT6105M controller supports IPv4 IP/TCP/UDP transmit/receive
checksum offload and VLAN tag insertion and stripping.
The
.Nm
driver additionally supports Wake on LAN (WoL).
See
.Xr arp 8
and
.Xr ifconfig 8
for more details.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media types:
.Bl -tag -width full-duplex
.It autoselect
Enable autoselection of the media type and options.
The user can manually override
the autoselected mode by adding media options to the appropriate
.Xr hostname.if 5
file.
.It 10baseT
Set 10Mbps operation.
The
.Ar mediaopt
option can also be used to select either
.Ar full-duplex
or
.Ar half-duplex
modes.
.It 100baseTX
Set 100Mbps (Fast Ethernet) operation.
The
.Ar mediaopt
option can also be used to select either
.Ar full-duplex
or
.Ar half-duplex
modes.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media options:
.Bl -tag -width full-duplex
.It full-duplex
Force full duplex operation.
.It half-duplex
Force half duplex operation.
.El
.Pp
Note that the 100baseTX media type is only available if supported
by the adapter.
.Pp
For more information on configuring this device, see
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "vr0: couldn't map memory"
A fatal initialization error has occurred.
.It "vr0: couldn't map interrupt"
A fatal initialization error has occurred.
.It "vr0: watchdog timeout"
The device has stopped responding to the network, or there is a problem with
the network connection (cable).
.It "vr0: no memory for rx list"
The driver failed to allocate an mbuf for the receiver ring.
.It "vr0: no memory for tx list"
The driver failed to allocate an mbuf for the transmitter ring when
allocating a pad buffer or collapsing an mbuf chain into a cluster.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
device driver first appeared in
.Fx 3.0 .
.Ox
support first appeared in
.Ox 2.5 .
.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Nm
driver was written by
.An Bill Paul Aq Mt wpaul@@ctr.columbia.edu .
.Sh CAVEATS
The
.Nm
driver copies transmit mbuf chains into longword-aligned buffers prior
to transmission in order to pacify the VT3043 and VT86C100A chips.
If buffers are not aligned correctly, the chip will round the
supplied buffer address and begin DMAing from the wrong location.
This buffer copying impairs transmit performance on slower systems but can't
be avoided.
On faster machines (e.g., a Pentium II), the performance
impact is much less noticeable.

.It "vr0: chip is in D3 power state -- setting to D0"
This message applies only to adapters which support power management.
Some operating systems place the controller in low power
mode when shutting down, and some PCI BIOSes fail to bring the chip
out of this state before configuring it.
The controller loses all of its PCI configuration in the D3 state, so if the
BIOS does not set it back to full power mode in time, it won't be able to
configure it correctly.
The driver tries to detect this condition and bring
the adapter back to the D0 (full power) state, but this may not be
enough to return the driver to a fully operational condition.
If this message appears at boot time and the driver fails to attach
the device as a network interface, a second warm boot will have to be
performed to have the device properly configured.
.Pp
Note that this condition only occurs when warm booting from another
operating system.
If the system is powered down prior to booting
.Ox ,
the card should be configured correctly.

@Second part of the man4 mi cleanup.
- more/better xrefs
- sync .Cd lines with actual configuration files
- intro(4) reference police
- huge usb(4) update
- follow mdoc.samples suggested man page section ordering when necessary
- add netintro(4) and hostname.if(5) xrefs to all ethernet drivers

@Incomplete section 4 mi manual page cleanup.
- make configuration lines match GENERIC files
- more Xr (hopefully usefule Xr)
- never mention intro(4) on non-physical devices (i.e. protocols), always
mention it for physical devices
- random text style and quoting fixes
- drivers ported from FreeBSD did mention rc.conf instead of hostname.if as
the place to put mediaopt
- some .Tn UNIX -> .Ox replacements
- etc, etc...
