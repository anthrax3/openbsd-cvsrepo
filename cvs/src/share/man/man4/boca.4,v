.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm boca
.Nd multiplexing serial communications interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
For 4-port BB1004 boards and 8-port BB1008 boards:
.Pp
.Cd "boca0 at isa? port 0x100 irq 5"
.Cd "com* at boca?"
.Pp
For 16-port BB2016 boards:
.Pp
.Cd "boca0 at isa? port 0x100 irq 5"
.Cd "boca1 at isa? port 0x140 irq 5"
.Cd "com* at boca?"
.Pp
(The BB2016 is functionally equivalent to two BB1008 boards,
and is configured as such.)
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for BOCA Research BB1004, BB1008, and BB2016
boards that multiplex together up to four, eight, or sixteen
.Tn EIA
.Tn RS-232C
.Pq Tn CCITT V.28
communications interfaces.
.Pp
Each
.Nm
device is the master device for up to eight
.Nm com
devices.
The kernel configuration specifies these
.Nm com
devices as slave devices of the
.Nm
device, as shown in
.Sx SYNOPSIS .
The slave ID given for each
.Nm com
device determines which bit in the interrupt multiplexing register is
tested to find interrupts for that device.
The
.Cd port
specification for the
.Nm
device is used to compute the base addresses for the
.Nm com
subdevices and the port for the interrupt multiplexing register.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width Pa
.It Pa /dev/tty??
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr com 4 ,
.Xr intro 4 ,
.Xr isa 4
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver was written by
.An Charles Hannum ,
based on the
.Nm ast
driver and source code from
.An David Muir Sharnoff .
David wishes to acknowledge the assistance of
.An Jason Venner
in determining how to use the BOCA boards.

@Incomplete section 4 mi manual page cleanup.
- make configuration lines match GENERIC files
- more Xr (hopefully usefule Xr)
- never mention intro(4) on non-physical devices (i.e. protocols), always
mention it for physical devices
- random text style and quoting fixes
- drivers ported from FreeBSD did mention rc.conf instead of hostname.if as
the place to put mediaopt
- some .Tn UNIX -> .Ox replacements
- etc, etc...
