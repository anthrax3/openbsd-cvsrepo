@As requested by deraadt, split acpi(4) up into individual driver pages.

While doing this, improve and add the text of some manuals.  Some of
these are simply revived versions of the pages back from when they were
individual pages.

Input and ok from jmc.

Note:  When we wrote these pages, people submitted new pages to jmc and
I.  At some point during this, we decided to merge all pages into acpi(4)
(which is now being undone), and I lost track of who sent what.  Thus,
if you think you should be the copyright owner of any of these files,
get back to me in private.
