@Add a note to ppp(4)'s BUGS section where it talks about lack of IPv6
support to make it clear that pppoe(4) does work with IPv6. Problem noted
by Simon Farnsworth. Add xrefs to pppoe(4) and pppx(4) to show that this
isn't the only PPP implementation on OpenBSD. ok/tweak stsp@@

.Sh NAME
.Nm ppp
.Nd Point-to-Point Protocol network interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "pseudo-device ppp"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
interface allows serial lines to be used as network interfaces using the
.Em Point-to-Point Protocol
(PPP).
.Pp
A
.Nm
interface can be created at runtime using the
.Ic ifconfig ppp Ns Ar N Ic create
command or by setting up a
.Xr hostname.if 5
configuration file for
.Xr netstart 8 .
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It ppp0: afX not supported
The interface was handed
a message with addresses formatted in an unsuitable address
family; the packet was dropped.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
device appeared in
.Ox 1.2 .
.Sh BUGS
Currently, only the
.Xr ip 4
protocol is supported by this device.
Note that the
.Xr pppoe 4
device does support
.Xr ip6 4 .

@Incomplete section 4 mi manual page cleanup.
- make configuration lines match GENERIC files
- more Xr (hopefully usefule Xr)
- never mention intro(4) on non-physical devices (i.e. protocols), always
mention it for physical devices
- random text style and quoting fixes
- drivers ported from FreeBSD did mention rc.conf instead of hostname.if as
the place to put mediaopt
- some .Tn UNIX -> .Ox replacements
- etc, etc...
