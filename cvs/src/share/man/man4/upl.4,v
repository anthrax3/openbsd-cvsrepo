@First pass at removing clauses 3 and 4 from NetBSD licenses.

Not sure what's more surprising: how long it took for NetBSD to
catch up to the rest of the BSDs (including UCB), or the amount of
code that NetBSD has claimed for itself without attributing to the
actual authors.

@Add driver for Prolific PL2301/PL2302 host-to-host adapter. From NetBSD.
/* XXX - untested */

Note: just reminding myself that I need to create a nice diff for Lennart
to further portablize the USB code (I fell behind in doing this). In
particular, for this driver, the IF_INPUT() macro just does ether_input()
in OpenBSD, but we really want to call the local upl_input() routine.
