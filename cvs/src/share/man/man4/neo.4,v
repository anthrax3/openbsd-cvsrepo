.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm neo
.Nd NeoMagic 256AV/ZX audio device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "neo* at pci?"
.Cd "audio* at neo?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for NeoMagic MagicMedia 256AV and 256ZX
audio chips found in many laptops, and perhaps on some PCI cards.
.Sh FILES
The driver needs a firmware file,
which is loaded on demand when the device is attached:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent -compact
.It Pa /etc/firmware/neo-coefficients
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr ac97 4 ,
.Xr audio 4 ,
.Xr intro 4 ,
.Xr pci 4
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
device driver appeared in
.Ox 2.7 .
.Sh BUGS
This driver has some bugs because Neomagic refuses to provide documentation,
even though they are discontinuing their products.
At the time of contact, all persons working at the company were hiding
behind their receptionist as if in a stage of siege.

1.7
log
@Incomplete section 4 mi manual page cleanup.
- make configuration lines match GENERIC files
- more Xr (hopefully usefule Xr)
- never mention intro(4) on non-physical devices (i.e. protocols), always
mention it for physical devices
- random text style and quoting fixes
- drivers ported from FreeBSD did mention rc.conf instead of hostname.if as
the place to put mediaopt
- some .Tn UNIX -> .Ox replacements
- etc, etc...
