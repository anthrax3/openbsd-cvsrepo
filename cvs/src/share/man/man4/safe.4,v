.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm safe
.Nd SafeNet crypto accelerator
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "safe* at pci?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver supports cards containing any of the following chips:
.Bl -tag -width "SafeNet 1141" -offset indent
.It SafeNet 1141
The original chipset.
Supports DES, Triple-DES, AES, MD5, and SHA-1 symmetric crypto operations,
RNG, public key operations, and full IPsec packet processing.
.It SafeNet 1741
A faster version of the 1141.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver registers itself to accelerate Triple-DES, AES, MD5-HMAC,
and SHA1-HMAC operations for
.Xr ipsec 4 .
.Pp
Additionally, the driver provides input to the
.Xr random 4
subsystem.
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "safe0: Reduce max DMA size to N words for rev X.Y"
The 1.0 silicon has major
.Xr pci 4
bugs and may lock the bus completely.
There is no easy workaround.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr crypt 3 ,
.Xr intro 4 ,
.Xr ipsec 4 ,
.Xr pci 4 ,
.Xr random 4 ,
.Xr crypto 9
.Sh BUGS
Early silicon revisions can wedge the PCI bus.
