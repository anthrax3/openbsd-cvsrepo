.Dt SWITCH 4
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm switch
.Nd network switch pseudo device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "pseudo-device switch"
.Pp
.In sys/types.h
.In net/if.h
.In netinet/in.h
.In netinet/if_ether.h
.In net/if_bridge.h
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides a network interface pseudo-device.
The interface is the forwarding part of a network switch
and it works along with a controller, usually
.Xr switchd 8
or
.Xr switchctl 8 ,
through the device
.Pa /dev/switchN .
The
.Nm
device and the controller communicate using the OpenFlow
1.3 protocol.
.Pp
A
.Nm
interface is created using
.Ic ifconfig switch Ns Ar N Ic create
or by opening the character device
.Pa /dev/switchN .
.Pp
.Pa /dev/switchN
is the OpenFlow channel of the interface
.Pa switchN .
It is used for exchanging OpenFlow messages.
The device behaves like a stream, which means that a
.Xr read 2
may return one or more OpenFlow messages depending on the number of
bytes requested.
It may also read the message partially (e.g.\&
.Xr read 2
the OpenFlow message header and then the complete message).
The same applies to
.Xr write 2
calls, so it may send one or more OpenFlow messages with a single write
or use more than one
.Xr write 2
calls to send a single message.
.Sh IOCTLS
A
.Nm
interface responds to all of the
.Xr ioctl 2
calls specific to other interfaces listed in
.Xr netintro 4 .
.Pp
The following
.Xr ioctl 2
calls and their structures are commonly used by
.Nm
and
.Xr bridge 4 :
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -offset indent -compact
.It
.Dv SIOCBRDGIFS
.It
.Dv SIOCBRDGADD
.It
.Dv SIOCBRDGDEL

.Dv SIOCBRDGGIFFLGS

.Pp
The following
.Xr ioctl 2
calls are used only by the
.Nm
interface,
as defined in
.In sys/sockio.h :
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Dv SIOCBRDGADDL Fa "struct ifbreq *"
Add the interface named in
.Va ifbr_ifsname
to the switch named in
.Va ifbr_name
as a local port which connects the local system's network stacks.
Only one
.Xr vether 4
interface can be added as a local port.
.It Dv SIOCSWGDPID
Retrieve the datapath_id in the OpenFlow protocol of the switch named in
.Va ifbrp_name
into the
.Va ifbrpu_datapath
field.
.It Dv SIOCSWSDPID Fa "struct ifbrparam"
Set the datapath_id in the OpenFlow protocol of the switch named in
.Va ifbrp_name
to the value in the
.Va ifbrpu_datapath
field.
.It Dv SIOCSWGMAXFLOW Fa "struct ifbrparam"
Retrieve the maximum number of flows in the OpenFlow protocol
of the switch named in
.Va ifbrp_name
into the
.Va ifbrp_maxflow
field.
.It Dv SIOCSWSMAXFLOW Fa "struct ifbrparam"
Set the maximum number of flows in the OpenFlow protocol of the switch named in
.Va ifbrp_name
to the value in the
.Va ifbrpu_maxflow
field.
.It Dv SIOCSWGMAXGROUP Fa "struct ifbrparam"
Retrieve the maximum number of groups in the OpenFlow protocol
of the switch named
in
.Va ifbrp_name
into the
.Va ifbrpu_maxgroup
field.
.It Dv SIOCSWSMAXGROUP Fa "struct ifbrparam"
Set the maximum number of groups in the OpenFlow protocol
of the switch named in
.Va ifbrp_name
to the value in the
.Va ifbrpu_maxgroup
field.
.It Dv SIOCSWSPORTNO Fa "struct ifbreq"
Set the port_no in the OpenFlow protocol of the port named in
.Va ifbr_ifsname
of the switch named in
.Va ifbr_name
to the
.Va ifbr_portno
field.
.El
.Sh FILES

.Sh ERRORS
If open fails,
.Xr errno 2
may be set to one of:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er ENXIO
Could not create the interface.
.It Bq Er EBUSY
The device was already opened.
.It Bq Er ENOBUF
