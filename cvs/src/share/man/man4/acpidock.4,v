.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm acpidock
.Nd ACPI docking station
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "acpidock* at acpi?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver supports ACPI docking stations.
Docking stations are units that, for example, laptops may attach to in
order to expose a number of additional hardware devices.
The
.Nm
driver handles docking and undocking machines to gracefully detach
external devices.
.Pp
When docking and undocking, an event is passed to the driver which is
then reacted upon.
For undocking, this event is usually triggered by pressing a button on
the docking station or using a special keyboard combination; for docking,
the machine usually just has to be inserted.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver sets up a sensor that indicates docking state that can be
used with
.Xr sensorsd 8
to perform events when docking or undocking.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr acpi 4 ,
.Xr intro 4 ,
.Xr sensorsd 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver first appeared in
.Ox 4.1 .
.Sh AUTHORS
.An -nosplit
The
.Nm
driver was written by
.An Michael Knudsen Aq Mt mk@@openbsd.org .

The driver still does not actually work, so be sure to unmount
filesystems before detaching from the dock.
