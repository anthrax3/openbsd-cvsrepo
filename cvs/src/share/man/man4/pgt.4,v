.Sh NAME
.Nm pgt
.Nd Conexant/Intersil Prism GT Full-MAC IEEE 802.11a/b/g wireless network device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "pgt* at cardbus?"
.Cd "pgt* at pci?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for Conexant/Intersil GT-series devices
which can support the Full-Mac firmware, using the ISL3877,
ISL3880, and ISL3890 chips.
The
.Nm
driver will not (yet) work on similar devices using the ISL3886 or
similar chips which use the Soft-Mac firmware.
.Pp
These are the modes the
.Nm
driver can operate in:
.Bl -tag -width "IBSS-masterXX"
.It BSS mode
Also known as
.Em infrastructure
mode, this is used when associating with an access point, through
which all traffic passes.
This mode is the default.
.It IBSS mode
Also known as
.Em IEEE ad-hoc
mode or
.Em peer-to-peer
mode.
This is the standardized method of operating without an access point.
Stations associate with a service set.
However, actual connections between stations are peer-to-peer.
.It Host AP
In this mode the driver acts as an access point (base station)
for other cards.
.It monitor mode
In this mode the driver is able to receive packets without
associating with an access point.
This disables the internal receive filter and enables the card to
capture packets from networks which it wouldn't normally have access to,
or to scan for access points.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver can be configured to use hardware
Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP).
It is strongly recommended that WEP
not be used as the sole mechanism
to secure wireless communication,
due to serious weaknesses in it.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver can be configured at runtime with
.Xr ifconfig 8
or on boot with
.Xr hostname.if 5 .
.Sh FILES
The driver needs a set of firmware files which are loaded when
an interface is brought up:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent -compact
.It Pa /etc/firmware/pgt-isl3877
.It Pa /etc/firmware/pgt-isl3890
.El
.Pp
These firmware files are not free because Conexant refuses
to grant distribution rights.
In fact they have rebuffed thousands
of attempts to start a dialogue on this issue.
As a result, even though
.Ox
includes the driver, the firmware files cannot be included and
users have to download these files on their own.
.Pp
A prepackaged version of the firmware can be installed using
.Xr fw_update 1 .
.Sh HARDWARE
The following cards are among those supported by the
.Nm
driver:
.Bl -column "NETGEAR WG511 (Taiwanese, not Chinese)" "ISL3880" "CardBus" -offset 6n
.It Em Card Ta Em Chip Ta Em Bus
.It "3COM 3CRWE154G72" Ta ISL3880 Ta CardBus
.It "D-Link DWL-g650 A1" Ta ISL3890 Ta PCI
.It "I-O Data WN-G54/CB" Ta ISL3890 Ta PCI
.It "I4 Z-Com XG-600" Ta ISL3890 Ta PCI
.It "I4 Z-Com XG-900" Ta ISL3890 Ta PCI
.It "Intersil PRISM Indigo" Ta ISL3877 Ta PCI
.It "Intersil PRISM Duette" Ta ISL3890 Ta PCI
.It "NETGEAR WG511 (Taiwanese, not Chinese)" Ta ISL3890 Ta CardBus
.It "PLANEX GW-DS54G" Ta ISL3890 Ta PCI
.It "SMC EZ Connect g 2.4GHz SMC2802W" Ta ISL3890 Ta PCI
.It "SMC EZ Connect g 2.4GHz SMC2835W-v2" Ta ISL3890 Ta CardBus
.It "SMC 2802Wv2" Ta ISL3890 Ta PCI
.It "Soyo Aerielink" Ta ISL3890 Ta CardBus
.It "ZyXEL ZyAIR G-100" Ta ISL3890 Ta CardBus
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following example scans for available networks:
.Pp
.Dl # ifconfig pgt0 scan
.Pp
The following
.Xr hostname.if 5
example configures pgt0 to join network
.Dq mynwid ,
using WEP key
.Dq mywepkey ,
obtaining an IP address using DHCP:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
nwid mynwid
nwkey mywepkey
dhcp
.Ed
.Pp
The following
.Xr hostname.if 5
example creates a host-based access point on boot:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
mediaopt hostap
nwid mynwid
nwkey mywepkey
inet 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0
.Ed
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr arp 4 ,
.Xr cardbus 4 ,
.Xr ifmedia 4 ,
.Xr intro 4 ,
.Xr netintro 4 ,
.Xr pci 4 ,
.Xr hostname.if 5 ,
.Xr hostapd 8 ,
.Xr ifconfig 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver first appeared in
.Ox 4.0 .
.Sh AUTHORS
.An -nosplit
The
.Nm
driver was originally written for
.Fx
by
.An Brian Fundakowski ,
and then rewritten for
.Ox
by
.An Marcus Glocker
and
.An Claudio Jeker .
.Sh CAVEATS
Host AP mode doesn't support power saving.
Clients attempting to use power saving mode may experience significant
packet loss (disabling power saving on the client will fix this).

@make -column lists pretty again;

specifically, rewrite them to permit some markup in the column headers,
and use "Ta" instead of literal tabs; mandoc does not currently match groff
100%, but a mandoc fix may be some time off, and we've gone enough releases
with poorly formatting column lists.

in some cases i have rewritten the lists as -tag, where -column made
little sense.

@as with other list types, column lists generally do not need a Pp/-compact
construct;

this also sidesteps what seems to be a problem with mandoc, in that
"-column -compact" seems to mess up the formatting. thus these pages should
now have their lists formatted nicely (i.e. correctly aligned and with indent
applied);

as a side note, the fact that headers are not properly marked up is another
issue which will be addressed separately (a mandoc fix is needed, i think).
i have fudged a few of these to mark up properly, since the workaround does
make sense for some pages.

as another side note, i haven;t fixed man7, as i need to prepare a separate
diff for kristaps and ingo.

@add the following paragraph from the wi(4) manual page to the
CAVEATS section of all drivers claiming HostAP support:

"Host AP mode doesn't support power saving.  Clients attempting to
 use power saving mode may experience significant packet loss
 (disabling power saving on the client will fix this)."

unfortunately (or not?), more and more clients are using PS mode by
default and will not work properly with an AP running OpenBSD.

proper handling of STAs in PS mode will come in net80211 but is is
very unlikely that all drivers will be ported.

supports hardware WEP.
Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) is the de facto encryption standard
for wireless networks.
It can be typically configured in one of three modes:
no encryption; 40-bit encryption; or 104-bit encryption.
Unfortunately, due to serious weaknesses in WEP protocol
it is strongly recommended that it not be used as the
sole mechanism to secure wireless communication.
WEP is not enabled by default.

.It Cm 11a
Force 802.11a operation.
.It Cm 11b
Force 802.11b operation.
.It Cm 11g
Force 802.11g operation.
.El
.It Cm nwflag Ar flag
Set a specified flag for the wireless network interface.
The flag name can be either
.Ql hidenwid
or
.Ql nobridge .
The
.Ql hidenwid
flag will hide the network ID (ESSID) in beacon frames when operating
in Host AP mode.
It will also prevent responses to probe requests with an unspecified
network ID.
The
.Ql nobridge
flag will disable the direct bridging of frames between associated
nodes when operating in Host AP mode.
Setting this flag will block and filter direct inter-station
communications.
.Pp
Note that the
.Ql hidenwid
and
.Ql nobridge
options do not provide any security.
The hidden network ID will be sent in clear text by associating
stations and can be easily discovered with tools like
.Xr tcpdump 8
and
.Xr hostapd 8 .
.It Fl nwflag Ar flag
Remove a specified flag for the wireless network interface.
.It Cm nwid Ar id
Set the network ID.
The
.Ar id
can either be any text string up to 32 characters in length,
or a series of hexadecimal digits up to 64 digits.
An empty
.Ar id
string allows the interface to connect to any available access points.
By default the
.Nm
driver uses an empty string.
Note that network ID is synonymous with Extended Service Set ID (ESSID).
.It Fl nwid
Set the network ID to the empty string to allow the interface to connect
to any available access point.
.It Cm nwkey Ar key
Enable WEP encryption using the specified
.Ar key .
The
.Ar key
can either be a string, a series of hexadecimal digits (preceded by
.Sq 0x ) ,
or a set of keys of the form
.Dq n:k1,k2,k3,k4 ,
where
.Sq n
specifies which of the keys will be used for transmitted packets,
and the four keys,
.Dq k1
through
.Dq k4 ,
are configured as WEP keys.
If a set of keys is specified, a comma
.Pq Sq \&,
within the key must be escaped with a backslash.
Note that if multiple keys are used, their order must be the same within
the network.
.Nm
is capable of using both 40-bit (5 characters or 10 hexadecimal digits)
or 104-bit (13 characters or 26 hexadecimal digits) keys.
.It Fl nwkey
Disable WEP encryption.
This is the default mode of operation.
