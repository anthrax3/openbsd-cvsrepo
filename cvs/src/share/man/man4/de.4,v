.Sh NAME
.Nm de
.Nd DEC DC21x4x (Tulip) 10/100 Ethernet device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "de* at pci?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
device driver supports Ethernet adapters based on the Digital
Equipment DC21x4x based self-contained Ethernet chips.
This includes, among others, the following models:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent -compact
.It Asante
.It Cogent EM100FX and EM440TX
.It DEC PCI DE435, EISA DE425, DE450, DE500
.It older Linksys 10, 10/100
.It SMC 8432, 9332, 9334
.It ZNYX ZX3xx
.El
.Pp
This driver may support other cards based on the 21040 and 21041 Ethernet
controllers, or the 21140[A], 21141, 21142, and 21143 Fast Ethernet
controllers.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media types:
.Bl -tag -width full-duplex -offset indent
.It autoselect
Enable autoselection of the media type and options.
.It 10baseT
Set 10Mbps operation on the 10baseT port.
.It 10base2
Set 10Mbps operation on the BNC port.
.It 10base5
Set 10Mbps operation on the AUI port.
.It 100baseTX
Set 100Mbps (Fast Ethernet) operation.
.It 100baseFX
Set 100Mbps operation.
.It 100baseT4
Set 100Mbps operation (4-pair cat-3 cable).
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media options:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width full-duplex -offset indent -compact
.It full-duplex
Set full duplex operation for UTP port.
.El
.Pp
For more information on configuring this device, see
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
To view a list of media types and options supported by your card try
.Ic ifconfig <device> media .
For example,
.Ic ifconfig de0 media .
.Pp
Note that the media types available depend on the particular card in use.
Some cards are explicitly programmed to a particular media type by a
setup utility and are not changeable.
.Pp
The old
.Dq ifconfig linkN
method of configuration is not supported.
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "de0: waking device from sleep/snooze mode"
The 21041 and 21140A chips support suspending the operation of the card.
.It "de0: error: desired IRQ of X does not match device's actual IRQ of Y"
The device probe detected that the board is configured for a different
interrupt than the one specified in the kernel configuration file.
.It "de0: not configured; limit of N reached or exceeded"
There is a limit of 32
.Nm
devices allowed in a single machine.
.It "de0: not configured; 21040 pass 2.0 required (X.Y found)"
.It "de0: not configured; 21140 pass 1.1 required (X.Y found)"
Certain revisions of the chipset are not supported by this driver.

.Sh AUTHORS
.An -nosplit
The
.Nm
device driver was written by
.An Matt Thomas .
This manual page was written by
.An David E. O'Brien .
.Sh CAVEATS
Since the 21040 is available on both EISA and PCI boards, one must be careful
in how one defines the 21040 in the kernel config file.

.Pp
On the alpha platform, disk space requirements on the installation media
cause the
.Nm
driver to be preferred to the
.Nm dc
driver.
However, the
.Nm dc
will perform better on some hardware; if this is the case, it is advised to
rename the
.Pa /etc/hostname.de*
files to
.Pa /etc/hostname.dc* ,
and disable the
.Nm
driver in the kernel, so that the
.Nm dc
driver will be used.
Refer to
.Xr boot_config 8
for details on how to disable drivers in the kernel.

- never mention intro(4) on non-physical devices (i.e. protocols), always
mention it for physical devices
- random text style and quoting fixes
- drivers ported from FreeBSD did mention rc.conf instead of hostname.if as
the place to put mediaopt
