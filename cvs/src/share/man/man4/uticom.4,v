.Sh NAME
.Nm uticom
.Nd Texas Instruments TUSB3410 USB serial adapter
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "uticom* at uhub?"
.Cd "ucom*  at uticom?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver supports serial port functionality on devices based on the
Texas Instruments TUSB3410 serial to USB converter chip.
.Pp
The device is accessed through the
.Xr ucom 4
driver which makes it behave like a
.Xr tty 4 .
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr intro 4 ,
.Xr tty 4 ,
.Xr ucom 4 ,
.Xr uhub 4 ,
.Xr usb 4
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
device driver first appeared in
.Ox 4.3 .
.Sh AUTHORS
.An -nosplit
The
.Nm
driver was written by
.An Dmitry Komissaroff Aq Mt dxi@@mail.ru
and
.An Hasso Tepper Aq Mt hasso@@estpak.ee .
.Sh CAVEATS
The
.Nm
driver doesn't support devices that have an internal EEPROM with firmware,
since such firmware is different to that supplied with
.Ox .
.Pp
Devices with multiple ports will attach all ports, though only
the first port can be used for now.
