Most of these files were not being compiled or kept in compilable state over

.Cd "ts0 at uba? csr 0172520"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Tn TS11/TSV05
combination provides a standard tape drive
interface as described in

operates only at 1600
.Tn BPI ,
and only one transport
is possible per controller.
.Pp
The
.Tn TS11
is attached to an
.Tn UNIBUS ,
and the TSV05 is attached to a
.Tn Q22 bus .
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It ts%d: no write ring.
An attempt was made to write on the tape drive
when no write ring was present; this message is written on the terminal of
the user who tried to access the tape.
.Pp
.It ts%d: not online.
An attempt was made to access the tape while it
was offline; this message is written on the terminal of the user
who tried to access the tape.
.Pp
.It ts%d: error at bn%d.
An error occurred on the tape

@Last minute cleanings (yes, close to release, last minutes spend longer
than regular minutes):
- do not install manual pages covering hardware we do not currently support
- link autoconf(4)
- remove mtio(4), this is an mi page now
- do not link kUmem(4) -> mem(4) since there is no corresponding code. What
a joke.
- .Xr .Cd police
- intro(4) update, closer to reality

May hang ungracefully if a physical error (non-data) occurs.
.Pp
The device lives at the same address as a
.Tn TM-11
.Pq Xr tm 4 ;
as it is very difficult to get this device to interrupt, a generic
system assumes that a
.Nm ts
is present whenever no
.Tn TM-11
exists but
the
.Tn CSR
responds and a
.Tn TS-11
is configured.
This does no harm as long as a non-existent
.Tn TS-11
is not accessed.
