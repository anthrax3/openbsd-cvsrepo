.Sh NAME
.Nm vv
.Nd Proteon proNET 10 Megabit ring
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "device vv0 at uba0 csr 0161000 vector vvrint vvxint"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm vv
interface provides access to a 10 Mb/s Proteon
.Tn proNET
ring network.
.Pp
The network address of the interface must be specified with an
.Dv SIOCSIFADDR
.Xr ioctl 2
before data can be transmitted or received.
It is only permissible to change the network address while the
interface is marked
.Dq down .
.Pp
The host's hardware address is discovered by putting the interface in
digital loopback mode (not joining the ring) and sending a broadcast
packet from which the hardware address is extracted.
.Pp
Transmit timeouts are detected through use of a watchdog routine.
Lost input interrupts are checked for when packets are sent out.
.Pp
If the installation is running
.Tn CTL
boards which use the old broadcast
address of
.Ql 0
instead of the new address of
.Ql 0xff ,
the define
.Dv OLD_BROADCAST
should be specified in the driver.
.Pp
The driver can use
.Dq trailer
encapsulation to minimize copying
data on input and output.
This may be disabled, on a per-interface basis,
by setting the
.Dv IFF_NOTRAILERS
flag with an
.Dv SIOCSIFFLAGS
.Xr ioctl 2 .
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It vv%d: host %d.
The software announces the host
address discovered during autoconfiguration.
.Pp
.It vv%d: can't initialize.
The software was unable to
discover the address of this interface, so it deemed
"dead" will not be enabled.
.Pp
.It vv%d: error vvocsr=%b.
The hardware indicated an error on
the previous transmission.
.Pp
.It vv%d: output timeout.
The token timer has fired and the
token will be recreated.
.Pp
.It vv%d: error vvicsr=%b.
The hardware indicated an error
in reading a packet off the ring.
.Pp
.It en%d: can't handle af%d.
The interface was handed
a message with addresses formatted in an unsuitable address
family; the packet was dropped.
.Pp
.It vv%d: vs_olen=%d.
The ring output routine has been
handed a message with a preposterous length.
This results in an immediate
.Em panic: vs_olen .
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr inet 4 ,
.Xr netintro 4
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver appeared in
.Bx 4.2 .
.Sh BUGS
The encapsulation of trailer packets in the
.Bx 4.2
version of this driver
was incorrect (the packet type was in
.Tn VAX
byte order).
As a result, the trailer encapsulation in this version is not compatible
with the
.Bx 4.2
.Tn VAX
version.
