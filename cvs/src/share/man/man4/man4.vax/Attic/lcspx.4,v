.Sh NAME
.Nm lcspx
.Nd Low-Cost SPX color frame buffer
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "lcspx0 at vsbus0 csr 0x39302000        " Pq "VAXstation 3100 and 4000/90"
.Cd "lcspx0 at vxtbus0                      " Pq "VXT2000"
.Cd "wsdisplay* at lcspx?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
is an 8-bit color frame buffer commonly encountered in VAXstation 3100 model 76
and VAXstation 4000/90 systems, as well as VXT2000 terminals.
It is also available as an option for VAXstation 3100 model 30, 38, 40 and 48
systems.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver interfaces the frame buffer with the
.Xr wscons 4
console framework.
It does not provide direct device driver entry points
but makes its functions available via the internal
.Xr wsdisplay 4
interface.
