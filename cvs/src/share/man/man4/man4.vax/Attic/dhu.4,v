.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm dhu
.Nd DHU-11/DHV-11 communications multiplexer
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "dhu0 at uba0 csr 0160440"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
A DHU-11 provides 16 communication lines.
.Pp
Normal I/O
control parameters for individual lines are managed by
.Xr ioctl 2
calls.
Individual DHU-11 lines may be configured to run at any of 13 speeds
(50, 200 and 38400 baud are not available);
the speed may be set via
.Xr getty 8
or
.Xr stty 1
or may be communicated by other programs which
utilize
.Xr ioctl 2
such as
.Xr ifconfig 8 ,
see
.Xr tty 4 .
.Pp
The DHU-11 driver normally uses input silos
and delays receiver interrupts by 20 milliseconds
rather than taking an interrupt on each input character.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /dev/tty[S-Z][0-9a-f]xx -compact
.It Pa /dev/tty[S-Z][0-9a-f]
.El
.Sh NOTES
The driver currently does not make full use of the hardware
capabilities of the DHU-11, for dealing with XON/XOFF
flow-control or hard-wired
lines for example.
.Pp
Although the devices are not the same, a DHU-11 can convince the DH-11
autoconfiguration code that it is a DH-11.
.Pp
The 4 40-way cables are a pain.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr tty 4 ,
.Xr uba 4
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver appeared in
.Bx 4.3 .
A new
.Nm
driver showed up in
.Nx 1.1a .
.Sh BUGS
Even if the
.Nm
hardware supports DMA, the driver cannot make use of this capability.

An optional argument
.Ar flags
may be supplied with the device specification
in the config file indicating
that the line corresponding to
bit number
.Ar i
is not properly
connected, and should be treated as hard-wired with carrier
always present.  Thus specifying
.Ql flags 0x0004
for
.Li dhu0
would cause line
.Pa ttyS2
to be treated in this way.

.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It dhu(%d,%d): NXM fault.
No response from
.Tn UNIBUS
on a
.Tn DMA
transfer
within a timeout period.  This is often followed by a
.Tn UNIBUS
adapter
error.  This occurs most frequently when the
.Tn UNIBUS
is heavily loaded
and when devices which hog the bus (such as
.Tn RK07 Ns s )
are present.
It is not serious.
.Pp
.It dhu%d: silo overflow.
The character input silo overflowed
before it could be serviced.  This can happen if a hard error occurs
when the
.Tn CPU
is running with elevated priority, as the system may
then print a message on the console with interrupts disabled.
