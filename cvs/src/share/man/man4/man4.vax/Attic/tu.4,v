.Sh NAME

.Nd
.Tn VAX-11/750
.Tn TU58
console cassette interface
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm tu
interface provides access to the
.Tn VAX
11/750
.Tn TU58
console cassette drive.
.Pp
The interface supports only block
.Tn I/O
to the
.Tn TU58
cassettes.
The devices are normally manipulated with the
.Xr dd 1
program.
.Pp
The device driver is automatically included when a
system is configured to run on an 11/750.
.Pp
The
.Tn TU58
on an 11/750 uses the Radial Serial Protocol
.Pq Tn RSP
to communicate with the cpu over a serial line.
This protocol is inherently unreliable as it has no flow
control measures built in.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /dev/tu0xx -compact
.It Pa /dev/tu0
.El
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It tu%d: lost recv interrupt.
.br
A timer watching the controller detected no interrupt for
an extended period while an operation was outstanding.
This usually indicates that one or more receiver interrupts
were lost and the transfer is restarted.
.El
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver appeared in
.Bx 4.1 .
.br
A new driver showed up in
.Nx 1.1 a.
.Sh BUGS
The
.Tn VAX Ns \-11/750
console interface is unusable
while the system is multi-user; it should be used only with
the system running single-user and, even then, with caution.

control measures built in.  On an 11/730 the Modified
Radial Serial Protocol is used.  This protocol incorporates
flow control measures which insure reliable data transfer
between the cpu and the device.  Certain 11/750's have
been modified to use the
.Tn MRSP
prom used in the 11/730.
To reliably use the console
.Tn TU58
on an 11/750 under
.Tn UNIX ,
the
.Tn MRSP
prom is required.  For those 11/750's without
an
.Tn MRSP
prom, an unreliable but often
useable interface has been developed.
This interface uses an assembly language ``pseudo-dma'' routine
to minimize the receiver interrupt service latency.
To include this code in
the system, the configuration must
.Em not
specify the
system will run on an 11/730 or use an
.Tn MRSP
prom.
This unfortunately makes it impossible to configure a
single system which will properly handle
.Tn TU58 Ns 's
on both an 11/750
and an 11/730 (unless both machines have
.Tn MRSP
proms).
