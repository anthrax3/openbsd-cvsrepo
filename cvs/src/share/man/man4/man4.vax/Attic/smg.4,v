.Sh NAME
.Nm smg
.Nd Small Monochrome Graphics frame buffer
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "smg0 at vsbus0 csr 0x200f0000"
.Cd "wsdisplay* at smg?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
is a monochrome frame buffer found on-board most VAXstation 3100 systems.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver interfaces the frame buffer with the
.Xr wscons 4
console framework.
It does not provide direct device driver entry points
but makes its functions available via the internal
.Xr wsdisplay 4
interface.
.Pp
When a color option board (either a
.Xr gpx 4
or a spx frame buffer) is installed, the
.Nm
driver will not attach by default, since the color option takes over the
video connector on the back of the system.
However, the output signal pins are independent, and it is possible to
connect a monochrome video cable even if a color option board is installed.
To force the
.Nm
driver to attach in this case, change the device flags to 1.
It will however not be possible to use the monochrome frame buffer
as the
.Ox
console in this case.
