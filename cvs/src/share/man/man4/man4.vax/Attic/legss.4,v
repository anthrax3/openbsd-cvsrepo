.Dt LEGSS 4 vax
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm legss
.Nd Low-End Graphics Subsystem
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "legss* at mbus0 mid 7"
.Cd "wsdisplay* at legss?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is an 8-bit color frame buffer found in VAXstation 35x0 and 38x0 series.
An optional VCB03 16 plane option expands it to a 24-bit color frame buffer.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver interfaces the frame buffer with the
.Xr wscons 4
console framework.
It does not provide direct device driver entry points
but makes its functions available via the internal
.Xr wsdisplay 4
interface.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr intro 4 ,
.Xr mbus 4 ,
.Xr wscons 4 ,
.Xr wsdisplay 4
.Sh BUGS
The 16 plane option is currently not supported, and needs to be removed
for the
.Nm
driver to operate properly.

@Minimal driver for the VAXstation 35x0/38x0 LEGSS option, currently limited
to 8 bit mode operation, and no color or accelerated features until I can
find documentation about it.

Speed is decent by VAX standards, except for scrolling, which is so
abysmally slow one could see ZZ Top's beards growing while waiting for the
screen to scroll...
