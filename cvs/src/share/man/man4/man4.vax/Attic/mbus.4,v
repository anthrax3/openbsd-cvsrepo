@Minimal driver for the VAXstation 35x0/38x0 LEGSS option, currently limited
to 8 bit mode operation, and no color or accelerated features until I can
find documentation about it.

Speed is decent by VAX standards, except for scrolling, which is so
abysmally slow one could see ZZ Top's beards growing while waiting for the
screen to scroll...

1.1
log
@Add support for the ``Firefox'' VAXstation 3520/3540/3820/3840 workstations,
currently limited to serial console and a single processor working.

All ``on-board'' devices, including the Q-bus adapter, but except for
the frame buffer, are supported. The machine will boot over the network
or from SCSI devices.

Lots of thanks to Al Kossow for www.bitsavers.org, on which I found the
technical documentation allowing me to complete this port (which was
lacking at the time I got that machine...).
