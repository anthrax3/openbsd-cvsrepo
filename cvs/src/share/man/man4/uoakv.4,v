.Sh NAME
.Nm uoakv
.Nd Toradex OAK USB +/-10V 8channel ADC interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "uoakv* at uhidev?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the Toradex OAK 10V device.
The sensor possesses a collection of sensor values which are
made available through the
.Xr sysctl 8
interface.
.Pp
The ADC date unit is "VDC"(DC voltage) and the value is signed.
Because the Analog-Digital conversion cycle of the device is faster
than the sensor framework update cycle,
the driver keeps maximum/minimum/average values of each cycle as
independent sensors.
.Pp
The device has a unique serial number,
indicated in the description part of the sensor value.
