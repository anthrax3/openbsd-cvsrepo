.Nd virtual random number generator
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "vrng0 at vbus?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the random number generation service
provided by the UltraSPARC Hypervisor as found on sun4v systems.
.Pp
Driven by periodic checks for available data from the generator,
.Nm
supplies entropy to the
.Xr random 4
driver for common usage.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr intro 4 ,
.Xr random 4 ,
.Xr vbus 4
.Sh HISTORY
The

.Ox 4.5 .
.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Nm
driver was written by
.An Mark Kettenis Aq Mt kettenis@@openbsd.org .
