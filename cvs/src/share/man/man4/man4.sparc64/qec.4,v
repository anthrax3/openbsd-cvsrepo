@Last minute cleaning:
- .Xr .Cd police
- esp(4) layout glitch
- intro(4) sorted and augmented
- in pcons(4), mention that this is a last-chance driver that should
generally not be used. even if the earth stops spinning.

@More sparc64 manual pages.
Most of these are modified sparc manpages, except for gem.4 which is new,

modifies it.
