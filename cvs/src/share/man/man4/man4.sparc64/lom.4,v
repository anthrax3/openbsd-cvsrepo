.Sh NAME
.Nm lom
.Nd lights out management
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "lom* at ebus?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the LOMlite lights out management module
found on Sun Netra t1 systems and the LOMlite2 module found on Sun
Fire V100/V120 and Sun Netra X1 systems.
Temperature readings, PSU status and fan status provided by the LOM
are made available through the
.Xr sysctl 8
interface.
The integrated
.Xr watchdog 4
timer can be configured through the
.Xr sysctl 8
interface as well.
The watchdog timer supports timeouts between 1 and 126 seconds.
If the watchdog is disabled, which is its default state, it will turn
on the system's fault LED after the maximum timeout of 126 seconds.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver will update the hostname stored in the LOM whenever the
system's hostname is changed.
