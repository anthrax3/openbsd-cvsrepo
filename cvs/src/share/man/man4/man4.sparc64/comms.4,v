@Add code to attach sun mice on sparc and sparc64 as wsmouse devices. Since
not all Sun mice run at the canonical 1200 bps, hop between 1200, 4800 and
9600 bps by paying attention to breaks on the line.

Attachement and engine code written 7 years ago for OpenBSD/sparc, except for
sparc64 com(4) attachment. Speed hop idea borrowed from Opensolaris.

This allows sparc and sparc64 users to run X11 without needing a configuration
file anymore, as it was in the XFree86 3.x days. Multihead configurations
will still need a minimal configuration file, though.
