.Sh NAME
.Nm pcons
.Nd SPARC64 PROM console interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "pcons0 at mainbus0"
.Cd "wsdisplay* at pcons?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
device provides a simple text console, using the PROM services for
input and/or output if no other driver handles this task.
It will use the PROM console devices set via the
.Dq input-device
and
.Dq output-device
variables.
.Pp
This driver is provided as a fallback console mechanism
if the real console hardware cannot be driven in
.Ox .
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /dev/console
.It Pa /dev/console
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr intro 4 ,
.Xr tty 4
.Sh HISTORY
.Ox
support for the PROM console
first appeared in
.Ox 3.0 .
.Sh CAVEATS
If
.Nm
handles console input, the PROM will handle break (or Stop-A) sequences before
.Nm pcons .
The preferred way to enter
.Xr ddb 4
on a ddb-enabled pcons console is then to enter the following sequence :
