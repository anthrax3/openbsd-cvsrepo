.Sh NAME
.Nm hme
.Nd SPARC National DP83840 ethernet interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "hme* at pci? dev ? function ?"
.Cd "hme* at sbus? slot ? offset ?"
.Cd "nsphy* at mii? phy ?"
.Cd "qsphy* at mii? phy ?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
interface provides access to the 10Mb/s and 100Mb/s Ethernet networks via the
.Tn National
DP83840
Ethernet 10/100 Mb/s Physical Layer
or the
.Tn Quality
QS6612
Ethernet MII Transceiver for Category 5 Twisted Pair Cable
chip sets.
The
.Nm
is found on the SunSwift and Sun QuadFastEthernet boards.
.Pp
Each of the host's network addresses
is specified at boot time with an
.Dv SIOCSIFADDR
.Xr ioctl 2 .
The
.Nm
interface employs the address resolution protocol described in
.Xr arp 4
to dynamically map between Internet and Ethernet addresses on the local
network.
.Pp
When a
.Nm
interface is brought up, by default, it will attempt to auto-negotiate the
link speed and duplex.
The speeds, in order of attempt, are:
100Mb/s Full Duplex, 100Mb/s Half Duplex, 10 Mb/s Full Duplex, and
10 Mb/s Half Duplex.
.Pp
The
.Nm
supports several media types, which are selected via the
.Xr ifconfig 8
command.
The supported media types are:
.Bl -tag -width "media autoselect" -offset indent
.It media autoselect
Attempt to autoselect the media type (default)
.It media 100baseTX  mediaopt full-duplex
Use 100baseTX, full duplex
.It media 100baseTX Op mediaopt half-duplex
Use 100baseTX, half duplex
.It media 10baseT mediaopt full-duplex
Use 10baseT, full duplex
.It media 10baseT Op mediaopt half-duplex
Use 10baseT, half duplex

log
@Last minute cleaning:
- .Xr .Cd police
- esp(4) layout glitch
- intro(4) sorted and augmented
- in pcons(4), mention that this is a last-chance driver that should
generally not be used. even if the earth stops spinning.

Most of these are modified sparc manpages, except for gem.4 which is new,
and probably not correct, but jason@@ wants it to be in the tree before he
modifies it.
