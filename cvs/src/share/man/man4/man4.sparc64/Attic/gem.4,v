.Nm gem
.Nd SPARC64 GEM gigabit ethernet interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "gem* at pci? dev ? function ?"
.Cd "nsphy* at mii? phy ?"
.Cd "qsphy* at mii? phy ?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
interface provides access to the 10Mb/s, 100Mb/s and 1Gb/s Ethernet networks.
.\" ... via the FOO or the BAR chipsets.
The
.Nm
is found on the
.Tn Sun
GEM and ERI 10/100 boards, as well as the
.Tn Apple
GMAC board.
.Pp
Each of the host's network addresses
is specified at boot time with an
.Dv SIOCSIFADDR
.Xr ioctl 2 .
The
.Nm
interface employs the address resolution protocol described in
.Xr arp 4
to dynamically map between Internet and Ethernet addresses on the local
network.
.Pp
When a
.Nm
interface is brought up, by default, it will attempt to auto-negotiate the
link speed and duplex.
The speeds are tried in descending order, in Full
Duplex, then Half Duplex mode.
.Pp
The
.Nm
supports several media types, which are selected via the
.Xr ifconfig 8
command.
The supported media types are:
.Bl -tag -width "media autoselect" -offset indent
.It media autoselect
Attempt to autoselect the media type (default)
.\" Check and correct the gigabit modes. Are both copper and fiber supported?
.\" And in both duplex modes as well?
.It media 1000baseTX  mediaopt full-duplex
Use 1000baseSX on copper, full duplex
.It media 1000baseTX Op mediaopt half-duplex
Use 1000baseSX on copper, half duplex

Most of these are modified sparc manpages, except for gem.4 which is new,
