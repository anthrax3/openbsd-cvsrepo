.Sh NAME
.Nm sab ,
.Nm sabtty
.Nd Infineon SAB82532 (ESCC2) serial communications driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "sab* at ebus?"
.Cd "sabtty* at sab?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
is an
.Tn Infineon
(formerly
.Tn Siemens )
SAB82532 (ESCC2) serial interface chip used in PCI-based UltraSPARC
.Tn Sun
workstations.
The ESCC2 provides two independent input/output channels per instance.
These chips are normally used to provide RS-423 and RS232 serial ports
for general purpose use.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports all of the standard
.Xr tty 4
ioctl calls.
The status of the DTR, RTS, CTS, and DCD signals can be queried with
TIOCMGET command, but, due to limitations in the hardware,
only the DTR and RTS signals can be modified with TIOCMSET, TIOCMBIC,
and TIOCMBIS
.Xr ioctl 2
commands.

@Last minute cleaning:
- .Xr .Cd police
- esp(4) layout glitch
- intro(4) sorted and augmented
- in pcons(4), mention that this is a last-chance driver that should
generally not be used. even if the earth stops spinning.
