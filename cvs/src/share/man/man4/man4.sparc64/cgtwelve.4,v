.Sh NAME
.Nm cgtwelve
.Nd accelerated 24-bit color frame buffer
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "cgtwelve* at sbus?"
.Cd "wsdisplay* at cgtwelve?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
is a triple-slot SBus color frame buffer, with graphics acceleration
and overlay capabilities.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver interfaces the frame buffer with the
.Xr wscons 4
console framework.
It does not provide direct device driver entry points
but makes its functions available via the internal
.Xr wsdisplay 4
interface.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr intro 4 ,
.Xr sbus 4 ,
.Xr wscons 4 ,
.Xr wsdisplay 4
.Sh CAVEATS
The only way to connect a
.Nm
frame buffer to an UltraSPARC is with the help of an
.Xr xbox 4
SBus Expansion subsystem.
.Pp
This driver does not support any acceleration features.

@Not-functional-enough driver for the Sun Expert3D cards, put in tree as an
incentive for further tinkering only; not for the faint of heart.

@Now that xbox sort-of works on sparc64, port the cgtwelve driver, since
the only way to connect it to a sparc64 machine is via an xbox device.
