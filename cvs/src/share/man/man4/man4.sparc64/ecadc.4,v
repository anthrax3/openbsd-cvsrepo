.Sh NAME
.Nm ecadc
.Nd environmental monitoring subsystem temperature sensor
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "ecadc* at iic?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver supports the PCF8591 I2C analog to digital converter that is
part of the environmental monitoring subsystem found on the Sun
Enterprise 250 and Sun Enterprise 450 systems.
The temperature readings are made available through the
.Xr sysctl 8
interface.
.Pp
The driver reads up to four A/D lines configured as temperature inputs.
Sensor names, type and calibration information are read from OpenFirmware.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr iic 4 ,
.Xr intro 4 ,
.Xr pcfadc 4 ,
.Xr sensorsd 8 ,
.Xr sysctl 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver first appeared in
.Ox 4.3 .
.Sh AUTHORS
.An -nosplit
The
.Nm
driver was written by
.An Mark Kettenis Aq Mt kettenis@@openbsd.org
based on the
.Xr pcfadc 4
driver written by
.An Damien Miller Aq Mt djm@@openbsd.org .

1.3
log
@pcfadc is in section 4 of the manual, not in section 8; use lower
case letters for both `environmental monitoring subsystem' and
`analog to digital converter', as these are generic terms and not
trade marks; s/analogue/analog/ on `analogue to digital converter'.

tweak on iic(4) reminded by jmc@@
