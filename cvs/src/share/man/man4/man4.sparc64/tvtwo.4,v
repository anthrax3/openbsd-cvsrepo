@Remove an OpenBSD-specific tweak regarding .Xr spacing
and make it compatible with bsd.lv mandoc and with groff-1.21.
This tweak was originally added for compatibility with groff-1.15,
which is no longer needed.

.Dt TVTWO 4 sparc64
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm tvtwo
.Nd accelerated 24-bit color frame buffer
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "tvtwo* at sbus?"
.Cd "wsdisplay* at tvtwo?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The Parallax XVideo and PowerVideo frame buffers, also known as
.Sq tvtwo ,
are memory based color frame buffers, with graphics acceleration
and overlay capabilities, and hardware MPEG decoding.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver interfaces the frame buffer to the
.Xr wscons 4
console framework.
It does not provide direct device driver entry points
but makes its functions available via the internal
.Xr wsdisplay 4
interface.
.Sh DISPLAY RESOLUTION
The XVideo and PowerVideo frame buffers will adapt their resolution and
refresh rate to the monitor they are connected to.
However, when not connected to a Sun monitor, the device will default to the
.Xr cgthree 4 Ns -compatible
1152x900 resolution, with a refresh rate of 67Hz.
A different resolution can be forced using the rotary switch on the edge
of the board.
.Pp
The available modes are as follows:
.Bl -column "Rotary" "Resolution" "Refresh Rate" -offset indent
.It Sy Rotary Ta Sy Resolution Ta Sy "Refresh Rate"
.It Li 0 Ta autodetect Ta autodetect
.It Li 1 Ta 1152x900 Ta 67Hz
.It Li 2 Ta 1152x900 Ta 76Hz
.It Li 3 Ta 1152x900 Ta 60Hz
.It Li 4 Ta 1024x768 Ta 77Hz
.It Li 5 Ta 640x480 Ta 60Hz
.El
.Pp
All other rotary positions will behave as position 0, except for positions
E and F.
Position E enables the board built-in debugger on the serial port, and
should not be used by end-users.
Position F selects the video mode settings stored in the cards NVRAM.
These settings cannot be modified under
.Ox .
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr intro 4 ,
.Xr sbus 4 ,
.Xr wscons 4 ,
.Xr wsdisplay 4
.Sh CAVEATS
This driver does not support any acceleration features at the moment.

@make -column lists pretty again;

specifically, rewrite them to permit some markup in the column headers,
and use "Ta" instead of literal tabs; mandoc does not currently match groff
100%, but a mandoc fix may be some time off, and we've gone enough releases
with poorly formatting column lists.

in some cases i have rewritten the lists as -tag, where -column made
little sense.
