.Dt POWER 4 sparc64
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm power
.Nd power button
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "power* at ebus?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Some UltraSPARC host bridges provide an interrupt when the power button
is depressed.
The
.Nm
driver catches that interrupt.
If the
.Va hw.allowpowerdown
.Xr sysctl 8
is set to 1,
.Nm power
will signal
.Xr init 8
to do a clean shutdown.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr ebus 4 ,
.Xr intro 4 ,
.Xr init 8 ,
.Xr rc.shutdown 8 ,
.Xr sysctl 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver was first supported in
.Ox 4.0 .
.Sh AUTHORS
The driver was written by
.An Jason Wright Aq Mt jason@@thought.net .

1.5
log
@machdep.kbdreset enables a shutdown by Ctrl-Alt-Del on amd64 and
i386.  Stop abusing it on other archs for controling a shutdown by
pressing the soft power button:

* Add a MI sysctl hw.allowpowerdown; if set to 1 (the default) it
  allows a power button shutdown.
* Make acpi(4)/acpibtn(4) honor hw.allowpowerdown.
* Switch the various power button intercepts on landisk, sgi, sparc64
  and zaurus over to hw.allowpowerdown.
* Garbage collect the machdep.kbdreset sysctl on all archs other than
  amd64 and i386.
