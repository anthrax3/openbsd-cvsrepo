@Remove an OpenBSD-specific tweak regarding .Xr spacing
and make it compatible with bsd.lv mandoc and with groff-1.21.
This tweak was originally added for compatibility with groff-1.15,
which is no longer needed.

.Dt MGX 4 sparc64
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm mgx
.Nd SMS MGX and MGXPlus accelerated 8/24-bit color frame buffers
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "mgx* at sbus?"
.Cd "wsdisplay* at mgx?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Tn Southland Media Systems
.Pq now Tn "Quantum 3D"
MGX and MGXPlus are SBus color frame buffers, with graphics acceleration
capabilities.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver interfaces the frame buffer with the
.Xr wscons 4
console framework.
It does not provide direct device driver entry points
but makes its functions available via the internal
.Xr wsdisplay 4
interface.
.Sh DISPLAY RESOLUTION
The MGX and MGXPlus frame buffers will adapt their resolution to the monitor
they are connected to.
However, when not connected to a Sun monitor, the device will default to the
.Xr cgthree 4 Ns -compatible
1152x900 resolution, with a refresh rate of 66Hz.
A different resolution can be forced using the set of DIP switches
.Pq sometimes covered by metal foil
located near the SBus connector on the board itself.
.Pp
The DIP switch settings are as follows:
.Bl -column "OFF OFF OFF OFF" "Resolution" "Refresh Rate" "Details"
.It Sy "Switches" Ta Sy "Resolution" Ta Sy "Refresh Rate" Ta Sy "Details"
.It Sy "1   2   3   4" Ta "" Ta "" Ta ""
.\" 0
.It Li "OFF OFF OFF OFF" Ta 1024x768 Ta 77Hz Ta ""
.\" 2
.It Li "OFF ON  OFF OFF" Ta 1280x1024 Ta 76Hz Ta ""
.\" 3 (exactly the same as #7. Not a typo)
.It Li "ON  ON  OFF OFF" Ta 1152x900 Ta 66Hz Ta ""
.\" 4
.It Li "OFF OFF ON  OFF" Ta 1152x900 Ta 76Hz Ta ""
.\" 6
.It Li "OFF ON  ON  OFF" Ta 1152x900 Ta 77Hz Ta ""
.\" 7
.It Li "ON  ON  ON  OFF" Ta 1152x900 Ta 66Hz Ta "cgthree compatible"
.\" 11
.It Li "ON  ON  OFF ON " Ta 1152x900 Ta 66Hz Ta "cgsix compatible"
.\" 12
.It Li "OFF OFF ON  ON " Ta 1280x1024 Ta 67Hz Ta ""
.\" 15
.It Li "ON  ON  ON  ON " Ta probed Ta probed Ta "factory default"
.El
.Pp
All other combinations are unsupported and may damage the hardware.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr intro 4 ,
.Xr sbus 4 ,
.Xr wscons 4 ,
.Xr wsdisplay 4
.Sh CAVEATS
This driver does not support mode switching at the moment, and
drives the card in PROM-compatible, 8 bit, mode only.

@make -column lists pretty again;

specifically, rewrite them to permit some markup in the column headers,
and use "Ta" instead of literal tabs; mandoc does not currently match groff
100%, but a mandoc fix may be some time off, and we've gone enough releases
with poorly formatting column lists.

in some cases i have rewritten the lists as -tag, where -column made
little sense.

@It turns out the mysterious chip with the heatsink glued on, found on mgx
video boards, is a known entity, so add support for 2d acceleration with
the help of the X code (which makes baby Jesus cry).

The blitter is fast enough to make a cgsix feel as slow as a cgthree in
comparison.
