.Sh NAME
.Nm xbox
.Nd SPARC SBus Expansion Subsystem
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "xbox*   at sbus?"
.Cd "sbus*   at xbox?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the Sun SBus Expansion Subsystem.
This device consists of an SBus card and a chassis which has
three additional SBus slots.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr intro 4 ,
.Xr sbus 4
.Sh BUGS
DMA support through
.Nm
is currently not implemented.
This means that SBus devices using DMA (such as SCSI and some Ethernet
controllers) will not attach correctly, and will not work.
@


1.1
log
@Preliminary xbox support: attaches, memory mapping and interrupts work, but
DMA transfers are not implemented yet, and are disabled (which causes drivers
to SBus cards on the xbox to fail to attach).

In practice, this allows frame buffers to work, maybe more devices; DMA
support will be worked on in the near future.
