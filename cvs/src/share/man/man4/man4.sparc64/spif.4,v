.Sh NAME
.Nm spif
.Nd SBus (spiffy) Serial/Parallel Interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "spif* at sbus?"
.Cd "stty* at spif?"
.Cd "sbpp* at spif?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the Sun Serial/Parallel Interface card
(Sun part number 501-1931)
based around the
Cirrus Logic CD180 octal serial controller
and the
Cirrus Logic PPC2 parallel port controller.
.Pp
The device minor numbers for this driver are encoded as follows:
.Bd -literal
    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
    | 7 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 0 |
    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
      |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
      |   |   |   |   |   +---+---+---> port number
      |   |   |   |   |
      |   |   |   |   +---------------> unused
      |   |   |   |
      |   |   |   +-------------------> dial-out (on tty ports)
      |   |   |
      |   |   +-----------------------> unused
      |   |
      +---+---------------------------> card number
.Ed
.Pp
Up to four cards are supported in the system.
.Pp
Each of the serial ports has an 8 byte FIFO for receive and transmit as
well as automatic hardware (RTS/CTS) flow control.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /dev/tty[jkl][0-7] -compact
.It /dev/tty[jkl][0-7]
Serial ports
.It /dev/sbpp[0-3]
Parallel ports
.El
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "spif0: ccr timeout"
A timeout occurred while writing to one of the CD180 registers.
.It "stty0-N: ring overflow"
Incoming characters were discarded because the application
in control of the device did not read the input fast enough.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr intro 4 ,
.Xr sbus 4 ,
.Xr tty 4
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver was first supported in
.Ox 3.1 .
.Sh AUTHORS
.An -nosplit
The driver was written by
.An Jason Wright Aq Mt jason@@thought.net ,
and is heavily based on the
.Xr magma 4
driver written by
.An Iain Hibbert Aq Mt plunky@@skate.demon.co.uk .
.Sh TODO
The parallel port is not supported yet.
.Pp
Dial-out (cua) devices are not yet supported.
