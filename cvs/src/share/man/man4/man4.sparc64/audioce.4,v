.Dt AUDIOCE 4 sparc64
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm audioce
.Nd SPARC64 EBus CS4231 audio device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "audioce* at ebus?"
.Cd "audio* at audioce?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
device uses the
.Tn Crystal Semiconductor
CS4231A
Parallel Interface, Multimedia Audio Codec
chip to implement the audio device interface described in
.Xr audio 4 .
This device is found onboard on some PCI/EBus based sparc64 models.
.Pp
The
.Nm
has a maximum precision of 16 bits and has both stereo and monoaural outputs.
.Sh MIXER INTERFACE
The
.Xr mixer 4
interface for
.Nm
provides the following controls:
.Bl -tag -width "outputs.monitor.mute"
.It Cm outputs.dac
Specifies the attenuation of DAC output.
A value of
.Ql 255
represents 0 dB attenuation.
.It Cm outputs.dac.mute
Specifies whether DAC output is muted.
.It Cm outputs.output
Specifies the set of enabled output ports.
The output ports are:
.Ql line ,
the line output jack,
.Ql hp ,
the low impedance headphone jack, and
.Ql spkr ,
the internal speaker.
Note: Not all systems support disabling the headphone and line output ports.
.It Cm inputs.cd
Specifies the gain applied to CD audio input.
A value of
.Ql 191
represents 0 dB.
.It Cm inputs.cd.mute
Specifies whether CD audio input is muted.
.It Cm inputs.line
Specifies the gain applied to line input.
A value of
.Ql 191
represents 0 dB.
.It Cm inputs.line.mute
Specifies whether line input is muted.
.It Cm outputs.monitor
Specifies the attenuation of ADC to DAC output.
A value of
.Ql 255
represents 0 dB.
.It Cm outputs.monitor.mute
Specifies whether ADC to DAC output is muted.
.It Cm record.volume
Specifies ADC input gain.
A value of
.Ql 0
represents 0 dB.
.It Cm record.source
Specifies the active input port for the ADC.
The following are valid ADC input ports:
.Ql line ,
line input,
.Ql cd ,
CD input,
.Ql mic ,
microphone input, and
.Ql mixerout ,
post-mixer output as heard on the output ports.
.It Cm record.mic_preamp
Specifies whether an additional +20 dB gain is
applied to the ADC's microphone input.

@Last minute cleaning:

- intro(4) sorted and augmented
- in pcons(4), mention that this is a last-chance driver that should
generally not be used. even if the earth stops spinning.
