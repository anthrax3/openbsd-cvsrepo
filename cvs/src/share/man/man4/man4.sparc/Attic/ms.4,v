.Sh NAME
.Nm ms
.Nd workstation mouse
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "pseudo-device mouse"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides an interface to the workstation console mouse.
This
.Tn Mouse Systems
three-button device produces five-byte blobs of the form:
.Pp
.Bd -literal -offset indent
b dx dy dx dy
.Ed
.Pp
where
.Dq b
is the button state, encoded as
.Li 0x80|(~buttons)
-- there are three buttons (4=left, 2=middle, 1=right) --
and
.Dq \&dx
and
.Dq \&dy
are X and Y delta values, none of which are in the range
.Bq Li 0x80..0x87 .
.Pp
The device special file
.Pa /dev/mouse
is used to get direct access to the mouse input stream.
The following
.Xr ioctl 2 Ns s
are supported (mostly just enough to keep the X11 server going):
.Bl -tag -width VUIDSFORMAT
.It VUIDSFORMAT
Set translation mode.
The argument is of type
.Fa "int *" ,
the only value supported is
.Dv VUID_FIRM_EVENT .
.It VUIDGFORMAT
Get translation mode.
The argument is of type
.Fa "int *" .
.Dv VUID_FIRM_EVENT
is always returned.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr kbd 4 ,
.Xr zs 4
.Sh BUGS
.Nm
is hardwired to the built-in
.Em zs1
serial port.

@- remove all trailing whitespace
     * except when it is escaped with a `\' at the end of the line
- fix remaining .Nm usage as well
- this is from a patch I received from kwesterback@@home.com, who has been
  working on some scripts for fixing formatting errors in mdoc'd man pages

Ok, so there could be a cost/benefit debate with this commit, but since I have
the patch we might as well commit it...
