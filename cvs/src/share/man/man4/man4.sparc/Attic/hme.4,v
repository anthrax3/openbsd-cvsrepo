.Sh NAME
.Nm hme
.Nd SPARC National DP83840 ethernet interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "hme* at sbus? slot ? offset ?                 " Pq "sun4m"
.Cd "nsphy* at mii? phy ?                          " Pq "sun4m"
.Cd "qsphy* at mii? phy ?                          " Pq "sun4m"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
interface provides access to the 10Mb/s and 100Mb/s Ethernet networks via the
.Tn National
DP83840
Ethernet 10/100 Mb/s Physical Layer
or the
.Tn Quality
QS6612
Ethernet MII Transceiver for Category 5 Twisted Pair Cable
chip sets.
The
.Nm
is found on the SunSwift and Sun QuadFastEthernet boards.
.Pp
Each of the host's network addresses
is specified at boot time with an
.Dv SIOCSIFADDR
.Xr ioctl 2 .
The
.Nm
interface employs the address resolution protocol described in
.Xr arp 4
to dynamically map between Internet and Ethernet addresses on the local
network.
.Pp
When a
.Nm
interface is brought up, by default, it will attempt to auto-negotiate the
link speed and duplex.
The speeds, in order of attempt, are: 100Mb/s Full Duplex, 100Mb/s Half Duplex,
10 Mb/s Full Duplex, and 10 Mb/s Half Duplex.
.Pp
The
.Nm
supports several media types, which are selected via the
.Xr ifconfig 8
command.
The supported media types are:
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxxxxxxxxxx -offset indent
.It media autoselect
Attempt to autoselect the media type (default)
.It media 100baseTX mediaopt full-duplex
Use 100baseTX, full duplex
.It media 100baseTX Op mediaopt half-duplex
Use 100baseTX, half duplex
.It media 10baseT mediaopt full-duplex
Use 10baseT, full duplex
.It media 10baseT Op mediaopt half-duplex
Use 10baseT, half duplex

.Sh HISTORY
.Ox
support for the
.Nm
first appeared in
.Ox 2.4 .
.Sh CAVEATS
The
.Nm
cards will not function in a sun4c class machine,
due to PROM limitations.

@- remove all trailing whitespace
     * except when it is escaped with a `\' at the end of the line
- fix remaining .Nm usage as well
- this is from a patch I received from kwesterback@@home.com, who has been
  working on some scripts for fixing formatting errors in mdoc'd man pages

Ok, so there could be a cost/benefit debate with this commit, but since I have
the patch we might as well commit it...
