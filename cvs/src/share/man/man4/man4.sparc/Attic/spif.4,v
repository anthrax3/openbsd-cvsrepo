.Sh NAME
.Nm spif
.Nd SBus (spiffy) Serial/Parallel Interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "spif* at sbus?   " Pq "sun4c/sun4e/sun4m"
.Cd "stty* at spif?   " Pq "sun4c/sun4e/sun4m"
.Cd "sbpp* at spif?   " Pq "sun4c/sun4e/sun4m"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm spif
driver provides support for the Sun Serial/Parallel Interface card
(Sun part number 501-1931)
based around the
Cirrus Logic CD180 octal serial controller
and the
Cirrus Logic PPC2 parallel port controller.
.Pp
The device minor numbers for this driver are encoded as follows:
.Bd -literal
    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
    | 7 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 0 |
    +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
      |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
      |   |   |   |   |   +---+---+---> port number
      |   |   |   |   |
      |   |   |   |   +---------------> unused
      |   |   |   |
      |   |   |   +-------------------> dial-out (on tty ports)
      |   |   |
      |   |   +-----------------------> unused
      |   |
      +---+---------------------------> card number
.Ed
.Pp
Up to four cards are supported in the system.
.Pp
Each of the serial ports has an 8 byte FIFO for receive and transmit as
well as automatic hardware (RTS/CTS) flow control.
.Sh FILES

.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "spif0: ccr timeout"
A timeout occurred while writing to one of the CD180 registers.
.It "stty0-N: ring overflow"
Incoming characters were discarded because the application
in control of the device did not read the input fast enough.
.El

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm spif
driver was first supported in
.Ox 2.5 .
.Sh AUTHORS
.An -nosplit
The driver was written by
.An Jason Wright Aq Mt jason@@thought.net ,
and is heavily based on the
.Xr magma 4
driver written by
.An Iain Hibbert Aq Mt plunky@@skate.demon.co.uk .
.Sh TODO
The parallel port is not supported yet.
.Pp
Dial-out (cua) devices are not yet supported.

@- remove all trailing whitespace

- fix remaining .Nm usage as well
- this is from a patch I received from kwesterback@@home.com, who has been
  working on some scripts for fixing formatting errors in mdoc'd man pages

Ok, so there could be a cost/benefit debate with this commit, but since I have
the patch we might as well commit it...
