log
@Rework the way onboard devices attach on Sun 4/110 systems (which only have a
28 bit address bus) by reusing the regular sun4 configuration stanzas (with
the upper four bits set in the device addresses), and clearing them when
searching for a PROM mapping.
This makes the obio autoconf code simpler, and all knowledge of the 4/110
specifics is now contained in a single file (dev/obio.c).
