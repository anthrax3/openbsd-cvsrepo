.Cd "bwtwo0 at sbus0                        " Pq "sun4c on-board"
.Cd "bwtwo* at sbus?                        " Pq "sun4c/sun4e/sun4m"

.Cd "wsdisplay* at bwtwo?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
is a black and white frame buffer commonly encountered
as the on-board frame buffer on sun4 and some sun4c class workstations.
It is also available as an SBus card for sun4c, sun4e and sun4m, or as a P4 bus
card for sun4 workstations.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver interfaces the frame buffer with the
.Xr wscons 4
console framework.
It does not provide direct device driver entry points
but makes its functions available via the internal
.Xr wsdisplay 4
interface.

1.27
log
@Rework the way onboard devices attach on Sun 4/110 systems (which only have a
28 bit address bus) by reusing the regular sun4 configuration stanzas (with
the upper four bits set in the device addresses), and clearing them when
searching for a PROM mapping.
This makes the obio autoconf code simpler, and all knowledge of the 4/110
specifics is now contained in a single file (dev/obio.c).

@New driver and wsdisplay type for the Weitek Power9000 and Brooktree Bt445
combination, found on the Tadpole SPARCbook 3 only (later model use the
Power9100 and are already supported).

Untested for lack of hardware and volunteers, but carefully crafted; if it
does not work out of the box, this should be a good starting point.

- fix remaining .Nm usage as well
- this is from a patch I received from kwesterback@@home.com, who has been

Ok, so there could be a cost/benefit debate with this commit, but since I have
