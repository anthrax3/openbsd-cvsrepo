.Sh NAME
.Nm rfx
.Nd Vitec/Connectware/AP&D RasterFlex framebuffer series
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "rfx* at sbus?"
.Cd "wsdisplay* at rfx?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The RasterFlex
series, originally manufactured by Vitec, later bought by Connectware,
then by Advanced Products & Design, are high-performance frame buffers
and frame grabber devices.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver only supports the RasterFlex frame buffers:
.Bl -tag -width RasterFLEX-HR -offset indent -compact
.It RasterFlex-24
.It RasterFlex-32
.It RasterFlex-HR
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver interfaces the frame buffer with the
.Xr wscons 4
console framework.
It does not provide direct device driver entry points
but makes its functions available via the internal
.Xr wsdisplay 4
interface.
.Sh DISPLAY RESOLUTION
The RasterFlex
frame buffers will adapt their resolution to the monitor they are
connected to.
However, when not connected to a Sun
monitor, the device will default to the 1152x900 resolution, with a refresh
rate of 66Hz.
A different resolution can be forced using the jumpers J2 to J4, located
near the video connector on the board itself.
.Pp
In the following tables, left
.Pq L
and right
.Pq R
jumper positions are described looking at the board with the video connector
on top.
If the jumper position is not specified
.Pq _ ,
it means it has to be removed
.Pq open .
.Ss RasterFlex-24 and RasterFlex-32 Jumper Settings:

.Xr wsdisplay 4
.Sh CAVEATS
This driver does not support any acceleration features at the moment, and
drives the card in PROM-compatible, 8 bit, mode only.
.Pp
The
.Nm
cards will not function in the third SBus slot of the Sun
SPARCstation 1, 1+ and 2 machines
.Pq and their clones ,
as well as the second SBus slot of the Sun SPARCengine 1E,
due to hardware limitations.

@Mention the SBus slot #2 in sun4e is `slave only', just as slot #3 in sun4c.

@make -column lists pretty again;

specifically, rewrite them to permit some markup in the column headers,
and use "Ta" instead of literal tabs; mandoc does not currently match groff
100%, but a mandoc fix may be some time off, and we've gone enough releases
with poorly formatting column lists.

in some cases i have rewritten the lists as -tag, where -column made
little sense.

@Enter rfx, driver for the SBus RasterFlex frame buffer family.
Currently 8-bit only for now.

This apparently completes the SBus frame buffer support list - yet if
you stumble upon an unsupported SBus frame buffer, I'd love to hear about it...
