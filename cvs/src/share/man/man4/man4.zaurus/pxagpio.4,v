.Sh NAME
.Nm pxagpio
.Nd PXA2x0 GPIO interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "pxagpio0 at pxaip?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver manages the integrated GPIO controller found
on the Intel PXA210, PXA250, PXA260 and PXA270 processors.
.Pp
It provides low-level services to other drivers.
Due to the tight integration of drivers on PXA2x0 processors, it is not
possible to provide the userland
.Xr gpio 4
interface.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr autoconf 4 ,
.Xr pxaip 4 ,
.Xr config 8
