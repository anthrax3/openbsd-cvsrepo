.Nd Alteon Networks Tigon I and II Gigabit Ethernet device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "ti* at pci?"
.Cd "ti* at sbus?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for Gigabit Ethernet adapters based on the
Alteon Networks Tigon Gigabit Ethernet controller chip, including
the following:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -compact -offset indent
.It
3Com 3C985-SX Gigabit Ethernet (1000baseSX)
.It
3Com 3C985B-SX Gigabit Ethernet (1000baseSX)
.It
Alteon AceNIC V Gigabit Ethernet (1000baseSX)
.It
Alteon AceNIC V Gigabit Ethernet (1000baseT)
.It
Digital EtherWORKS 1000SX PCI Gigabit Ethernet (1000baseSX)
.It
Farallon PN9000SX Gigabit Ethernet (1000baseSX)
.It
Netgear GA620 Gigabit Ethernet (1000baseSX)
.It
Netgear GA620T Gigabit Ethernet (1000baseT)
.It
Silicon Graphics Gigabit Ethernet (1000baseSX)
.It
Silicon Graphics Gigabit Ethernet (1000baseT)
.It
Sun Vector Gigabit Ethernet (1000baseSX)
.El
.Pp
The Tigon contains an embedded R4000 CPU, Gigabit MAC, dual DMA channels and
a PCI interface unit.
The Tigon II contains two R4000 CPUs and other refinements.
Either chip can be used in either a 32-bit or 64-bit PCI slot.
Communication with the chip is achieved via PCI shared memory and
bus master DMA.
SBus cards are also available and use a special bridge chip.
The Tigon I and II support hardware multicast address filtering,
VLAN tag insertion and stripping, and jumbo frames.
.Pp
While the Tigon chipset supports 10, 100 and 1000Mbps speeds, support for
10 and 100Mbps speeds is only available on boards with the proper
transceivers.
Most adapters are only designed to work at 1000Mbps, however the driver
should support those NICs that work at lower speeds as well.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media types:
.Bl -tag -width full-duplex
.It autoselect
Enable autoselection of the media type and options.
The user can manually override
the autoselected mode by adding media options to the appropriate
.Xr hostname.if 5
file.
.It 10baseT
Set 10Mbps operation
The
.Ar mediaopt
option can also be used to select either
.Ar full-duplex
or
.Ar half-duplex
modes.
.It 100baseTX
Set 100Mbps (Fast Ethernet) operation.
The
.Ar mediaopt
option can also be used to select either
.Ar full-duplex
or
.Ar half-duplex
modes.
.It 1000baseSX
Set 1000Mbps (Gigabit Ethernet) on fiber operation.
Only
.Ar full-duplex
mode is supported at this speed.
.It 1000baseT
Set 1000Mbps (Gigabit Ethernet) on copper operation.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media options:
.Bl -tag -width full-duplex
.It full-duplex
Force full duplex operation
.It half-duplex
Force half duplex operation
.El
.Pp
For more information on configuring this device, see
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
.Sh FILES
Two firmware files are necessary, for Tigon 1 and Tigon 2 devices.
These are loaded on demand
when the device is attached:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent -compact
.It Pa /etc/firmware/tigon1
.It Pa /etc/firmware/tigon2
.El
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "ti0: couldn't map memory"
A fatal initialization error has occurred.
.It "ti0: couldn't map interrupt"
A fatal initialization error has occurred.
.It "ti0: no memory for softc struct!"
The driver failed to allocate memory for per-device instance information
during initialization.
.It "ti0: failed to enable memory mapping!"
The driver failed to initialize PCI shared memory mapping.
This might happen if the card is not in a bus-master slot.
.It "ti0: no memory for jumbo buffers!"
The driver failed to allocate memory for jumbo frames during
initialization.
.It "ti0: bios thinks we're in a 64 bit slot, but we aren't"
The BIOS has programmed the NIC as though it had been installed in
a 64-bit PCI slot, but in fact the NIC is in a 32-bit slot.
This happens as a result of a bug in some BIOSes.
This can be worked around on the Tigon II, but
on the Tigon I initialization will fail.
.It "ti0: board self-diagnostics failed!"
The ROMFAIL bit in the CPU state register was set after system
startup, indicating that the on-board NIC diagnostics failed.
.It "ti0: unknown hwrev"
The driver detected a board with an unsupported hardware revision.
The
.Nm
driver supports revision 4 (Tigon 1) and revision 6 (Tigon 2) chips
and has firmware only for those devices.
.It "ti0: watchdog timeout -- resetting"
The device has stopped responding to the network, or there is a problem with
the network connection (cable).

@From Brad: "Rewrite the ti(4) man page a bit making it look closer
to the bge(4) man page.

- Remove mentioning PCI for the type of Gigabit adapters at the top
  since there are also SBus adapters.
- Shuffle the list of adapters and the description of the chipsets
  around so that the adapters list is further up the page and the
  description of the chipsets is further down the page.
- Make the list of adapter entries consistent and only mention
  the media type.
- Remove the bit about the Tigon 1 chipset no longer being
  in production. They're both no longer in production and
  I don't think this has much relevence in the man page.
  There are plenty of other Ethernet chipsets no longer in
  production as well."

driver provides support for PCI Gigabit Ethernet adapters based on
the Alteon Networks Tigon Gigabit Ethernet controller chip.
The Tigon contains an embedded R4000 CPU, Gigabit MAC, dual DMA channels and
a PCI interface unit.
The Tigon II contains two R4000 CPUs and other refinements.
Either chip can be used in either a 32-bit or 64-bit PCI slot.
Communication with the chip is achieved via PCI shared memory and
bus master DMA.
SBus cards are also available and use a special bridge chip.
The Tigon I and II support hardware multicast address filtering,
VLAN tag insertion and stripping, and Jumbo frame sizes up to
9000 bytes.
Note that the Tigon I chipset is no longer in active production: all new
adapters should come equipped with Tigon II chipsets.
.Pp
There are several PCI boards available from both Alteon and other
vendors that use the Tigon chipset under OEM contract.
The
.Nm
driver has been tested with the following Tigon-based adapters:
d53 1
a53 1
3Com 3C985-SX Gigabit Ethernet (Tigon 1)
d55 1
a55 1
3Com 3C985B-SX Gigabit Ethernet (Tigon 2)
d63 2
d69 2
d74 10
a83 8

- random text style and quoting fixes
- drivers ported from FreeBSD did mention rc.conf instead of hostname.if as
