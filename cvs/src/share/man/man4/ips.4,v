.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm ips
.Nd IBM SATA/SCSI ServeRAID controller
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "ips* at pci?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for IBM ServeRAID controllers, including:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -width Ds -offset indent -compact
.It
ServeRAID 3H/3HB/3L
.It
ServeRAID 4H/4L/4Lx/4M/4Mx
.It
ServeRAID 5i/5i II
.It
ServeRAID 6i/6M
.It
ServeRAID 7k/7M/7t
.El
.Pp
Although the controllers are actual RAID controllers,
the driver makes them look just like SCSI controllers.
All RAID configuration is done through the bootable
IBM ServeRAID Support CD;
a CD image is freely available at the IBM website.
.Pp
The management interface is provided through the
.Xr bio 4
device or one of the daughter
.Xr sd 4
devices as implemented in the
.Xr bioctl 8
utility.
Logical disk status is exposed under the
.Va hw.sensors
.Xr sysctl 8
and can be monitored using
.Xr sensorsd 8 .
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr bio 4 ,
.Xr intro 4 ,
.Xr pci 4 ,
.Xr scsi 4 ,
.Xr sd 4 ,
.Xr bioctl 8 ,
.Xr sensorsd 8 ,
.Xr sysctl 8
.Pp
.Lk http://www.ibm.com
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver first appeared in
.Ox 4.1 .
.Sh AUTHORS
.An -nosplit
The
.Nm
driver was written by
.An Alexander Yurchenko Aq Mt grange@@openbsd.org .
.Sh CAVEATS
Due to
.Xr bioctl 8
limitations the
.Nm
driver associates all unused and hot spare drives with the first volume
but the drives can be used for rebuilding any degraded volume.

@Use .Lk for HTTP hyperlinks, not .Pa.
Most of the patch from Arto Jonsson <ajonsson at kapsi dot fi>.
jmc@@ agrees in principle that .Lk is the right macro to use.

While here, update a few broken links,
and add missing markup at a few places.
