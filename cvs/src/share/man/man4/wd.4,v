.Sh NAME
.Nm wd
.Nd WD100x compatible hard disk driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "wd* at wdc? flags 0x0000"
.Cd "wd* at pciide? flags 0x0000"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver supports hard disks which emulate the Western Digital WD100x.
This includes standard MFM, RLL, ESDI, IDE, and EIDE drives, as well as
Serial ATA drives, and PCMCIA/CF storage media.
.Pp
The
.Cm flags
are used only with controllers that support DMA operations and
mode settings (like some
.Xr pciide 4
controllers).
The lowest order (rightmost) nibble of the
.Cm flags
define the PIO mode to use.
The next four bits indicate the DMA mode and the third nibble the UltraDMA
mode.
.Pp
For each set of four bits, the 3 lower bits define the mode to use
and the last bit must be set to 1 for this setting to be used.
For DMA and UltraDMA, 0xf (1111) means
.Dq disable .
For example, a
.Cm flags
value of 0x0fac (1111 1010 1100)
means
.Do
use PIO mode 4, DMA mode 2, disable UltraDMA
.Dc .
The special setting 0x0000 means
.Dq use whatever the drive claims to support .

@- remove all trailing whitespace
     * except when it is escaped with a `\' at the end of the line
- fix remaining .Nm usage as well
- this is from a patch I received from kwesterback@@home.com, who has been
  working on some scripts for fixing formatting errors in mdoc'd man pages

Ok, so there could be a cost/benefit debate with this commit, but since I have
the patch we might as well commit it...
