.Nd 3Com Fast EtherLink ISA (3c515) 10/100 Ethernet device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "ef* at isapnp?"
.Cd "nsphy* at mii?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
device driver supports the 3Com Fast EtherLink ISA family
of Ethernet cards, and embedded controllers based on the 3Com
.Dq corkscrew
EtherLink chips.
.Pp
The following media types and options (as given to
.Xr ifconfig 8 )
are supported:
.Bl -tag -width xxx -offset indent
.It Cm media No autoselect
Enable autoselection of the media type and options (default).
.It Cm media No 100baseTX Cm mediaopt No full-duplex
Set 100Mbps (Fast Ethernet) operation and force full-duplex mode.
.It Cm media No 100baseTX Cm mediaopt No half-duplex
Set 100Mbps (Fast Ethernet) operation and force half-duplex mode.
.It Cm media No 10baseT Cm mediaopt No full-duplex
Set 10Mbps operation and force full-duplex.
.It Cm media No 10baseT Cm mediaopt No half-duplex
Set 10Mbps operation and force half-duplex.
.El
.Pp
If no media options are present, the
.Nm
driver places the card into autoselect mode.
.Pp
For more information on configuring this device, see
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "ef0: adapter failure (XXXX)"
A fatal error during receive or transmit has occurred.
.It "ef0: eeprom failed to come ready"
When reading/writing the EEPROM, the busy bit failed to clear.
This may indicate a hardware problem.
.It "ef0: device timeout"
The device has stopped responding to the network, or there is a problem with
the network connection (cable).

@remove the maze of "other cards by this vendor are supported by so and so
driver": it is difficult to maintain, as evidenced by a mail from mike
belopuhov on tech@@, and not amazingly useful;

take out the Xrefs from SEE ALSO too;
if you want this info, `man -k' is the way to go;

@Incomplete section 4 mi manual page cleanup.
- make configuration lines match GENERIC files
- more Xr (hopefully usefule Xr)
- never mention intro(4) on non-physical devices (i.e. protocols), always
mention it for physical devices
- random text style and quoting fixes
- drivers ported from FreeBSD did mention rc.conf instead of hostname.if as
the place to put mediaopt
- some .Tn UNIX -> .Ox replacements
- etc, etc...
