@Subdevice interrupt dispatcher for voyager(4) and ohci@@voyager device, only
allowed to match on old gdium artwork, as newer artwork have nothing
connected to the usb pins, and this causes the empty bus probe to stall the
boot a few seconds.

.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm voyager
.Nd Silicon Motion Mobile Multimedia Companion Chip
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "voyager* at pci?"
.Cd "gpio0 at voyager?"
.\" .Cd "iic* at voyager?"
.Cd "ohci* at voyager?"
.Cd "smfb* at voyager?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver supports the Silicon Motion SM502 MMCC device.
.Pp
This chip is intended to fulfill most of a modern laptop's I/O needs, and
provides:
.Pp
.Bl -dash -compact -offset indent
.It
a 2D
.Xr smfb 4
frame buffer with analog RGB and digital LCD panel interfaces
.It
an 8-bit parallel interface
.It
a
.Xr ohci 4
USB controller
.It
two UART or IrDA ports
.It
two Zoom Video interfaces
.It
an AC97 or I2S audio codec
.It
two Synchronous Serial Ports
.Pq SSP
.It
Pulse Width Modulation
.Pq PWM
.It
64
.Xr gpio 4
pins
.El
.Pp
Not all the device interfaces are supported under
.Ox .
.Pp
The
.Xr ohci 4
component only attaches on Gdium Liberty systems with the older motherboard
artwork design, as newer systems do not have this USB port connected to
anything, causing an otherwise annoying long delay to probe the empty bus
on boot.
