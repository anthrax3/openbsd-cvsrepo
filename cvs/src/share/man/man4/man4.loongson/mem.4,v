.Sh NAME
.Nm mem ,
.Nm kmem
.Nd memory files
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The file
.Pa /dev/mem
is an interface to the physical memory of the
computer.
Byte offsets in this file are interpreted as physical memory addresses.
Reading and writing this file is equivalent to reading and writing
memory itself.
An error will be returned if an attempt is made to reference
an offset outside of
.Pa /dev/mem .
.Pp
Kernel virtual memory is accessed via the file
.Pa /dev/kmem
in the same manner as
.Pa /dev/mem .
Only kernel virtual addresses that are currently mapped to memory are allowed.
.Pp
On the loongson, physical memory is always contiguous, but can be accessed
from two distinct physical address windows:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
From address
.Ad 0x00000000
to
.Ad 0x0fffffff ,
the lowest 256 megabytes of memory.
.It
From address
.Ad 0x80000000
to
.Ad 0xffffffff ,
the whole memory, up to 2 gigabytes.
.El
.Pp
This layout implies that a given memory location within the first 256
megabytes may indifferently be addressed in the
.Ad 0x00000000 -
.Ad 0x0fffffff
address range or the
.Ad 0x80000000 -
.Ad 0x8fffffff
address range.
.Pp
The kernel virtual memory begins at address
.Ad 0xc000000000000000 .
.Pp
Writeability of these devices is controlled by the system
.Xr securelevel 7 .
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width Pa -compact
.It Pa /dev/mem
.It Pa /dev/kmem
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr securelevel 7
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Pa /dev/mem
and
.Pa /dev/kmem
files appeared in
.At v6 .
