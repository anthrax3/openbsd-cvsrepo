@Add support for the Lemote Lynloong all-in-one PC (basically a Fuloong without
the serial and IR ports, built into a mac-like case). At least PMON initializes
the frame buffer in a much friendlier video mode (1360x768x16), but there is
still no frame buffer acceleration yet.

Tested by wvdputte.

.Sh NAME
.Nm sisfb
.Nd SiS 315 Pro frame buffer
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "sisfb* at pci?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver supports the SiS 315 Pro frame buffer.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver interfaces the frame buffer with the
.Xr wscons 4
console framework, as a
.Xr wsdisplay 4
device.
.Pp
The PMON firmware initializes the frame buffer in a VGA compatible video mode,
either with a 640x400 resolution and 8 bits per pixel on Fuloong,
or a 1360x768 resolution and 16 bits per pixel on Lynloong.
It is currently not possible to change the frame buffer resolution and
color depth.

1.1
log
@Minimal frame buffer driver for the SiS 315 found on Lemote Fuloong systems.
Currently unable to change video modes or provide any form of acceleration,
so you are stuck in a 640x400x8 mode, but at least people scared of serial
consoles will get a chance to use their Fuloongs now.

Tested by otto@@ (early developments) and jasper@@ (final version)
