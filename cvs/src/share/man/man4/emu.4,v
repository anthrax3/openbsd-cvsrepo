.Cd "emu* at pci?"
.Cd "audio* at emu?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
device driver supports Creative Labs SoundBlaster Live!,
Sound Blaster PCI 512,
and SoundBlaster Audigy cards.
.Pp
These Environmental Audio cards are based upon the programmable EMU10K1
digital-processing chip.
.Pp
Hardware features:
.Bl -bullet -offset indent
.It
E-mu Systems, Inc. EMU10K1 music synthesis engine
.It
64-voice hardware polyphony with E-mu's patented 8-point interpolation
technology
.It
Up to 1024-voice polyphony with multi-timbre capability
.It
Support for real-time digital effects like reverb, chorus, flanger, pitch
shifter, or distortion across any audio source
.It
User-selectable settings are optimized for headphones, two or four speakers
.It
Processes sample rates from 5kHz to 48kHz
.It
Creative Multi Speaker Surround (CMSS) places any mono or stereo sound
source in a 360 degree audio space
.It
Hardware full-duplex support enables simultaneous record and playback
at 8 standard sample rates
.It
Allows multiple audio sources playback on the same speaker system

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
device driver appeared in
.Ox 3.1 .
.Sh AUTHORS
.An -nosplit
The
.Nm
driver was written by
.An Yannick Montulet Aq Mt yannick.montulet@@epitech.net
and ported to
.Ox 3.1
by
.An Michael Shalayeff Aq Mt mickey@@openbsd.org .
.Sh CAVEATS
ATTENTION!
.Pp
The hardware interface of this card contains registers not used
for normal operation, but potentially dangerous
and not possible to disable.
Potential damage ranges from frying the card to frying
motherboard or external equipment connected to its outputs.
.Sh BUGS
Currently this driver does not support MIDI, joystick input,
or the multi-voice capability.
.Pp
There is currently no way to control the volume of the DAC for
SoundBlaster Audigy cards.
.Pp
S-PDIF digital output does not work for
SoundBlaster Live! and
SoundBlaster Audigy cards.

@First pass at removing clauses 3 and 4 from NetBSD licenses.

Not sure what's more surprising: how long it took for NetBSD to
catch up to the rest of the BSDs (including UCB), or the amount of
code that NetBSD has claimed for itself without attributing to the
actual authors.

@Incomplete section 4 mi manual page cleanup.
- make configuration lines match GENERIC files
- more Xr (hopefully usefule Xr)
- never mention intro(4) on non-physical devices (i.e. protocols), always
mention it for physical devices
- random text style and quoting fixes
- drivers ported from FreeBSD did mention rc.conf instead of hostname.if as
the place to put mediaopt
- some .Tn UNIX -> .Ox replacements
- etc, etc...
