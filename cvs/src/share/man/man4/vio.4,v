.Sh NAME
.Nm vio
.Nd VirtIO network device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "vio* at virtio? flags 0x00"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the
.Xr virtio 4
network interface provided by bhyve, KVM, QEMU, and VirtualBox.
.Pp
Setting the bit 0x2 in the flags disables the RingEventIndex feature.
This can be tried as a workaround for possible bugs in host implementations of
.Nm
at the cost of slightly reduced performance.
.Pp
Setting the bit 0x100 in the flags forces the interface to be always in
promiscuous mode.
This can be used as a workaround for a bug in QEMU before version 1.7.2 that
prevents packets with a VLAN tag from being sent to the guest.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr intro 4 ,
.Xr virtio 4
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver first appeared in
.Ox 5.3 .
.Sh AUTHORS
.An -nosplit
The
.Nm
driver was ported to
.Ox
and improved by
.An Stefan Fritsch Aq Mt sf@@sfritsch.de .
It is based on the
.Nx
.Nm vioif
driver by
.An Minoura Makoto .

@Support large MTUs

Add support for the VIRTIO_NET_F_MRG_RXBUF feature, i.e. allow to
chain several rx buffers when receiving large packets.
This requires to put the rx meta data headers at the beginning of
the mbuf cluster instead of dedicated buffers.

@Add new drivers for virtio network (vio) and block devices (vioblk, the disks
attach as scsi disks).  These are paravirtualized devices offered by some
hypervisors like kvm and virtualbox.

The virtio transport driver has the pci specific parts separated out. This
will make it easier to add support for mmio (e.g. for ARM) later.
