.Sh NAME
.Nm tlphy
.Nd Texas Instruments ThunderLAN internal Ethernet PHY
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "tlphy* at mii?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver supports the internal PHY on TI ThunderLAN Ethernet interfaces.
The ThunderLAN PHY supports 10base5 (AUI) and 10base2 (BNC) on some
ThunderLAN implementations.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr ifmedia 4 ,
.Xr intro 4 ,
.Xr mii 4 ,
.Xr ifconfig 8

log
@First pass at removing clauses 3 and 4 from NetBSD licenses.

Not sure what's more surprising: how long it took for NetBSD to
catch up to the rest of the BSDs (including UCB), or the amount of
code that NetBSD has claimed for itself without attributing to the
actual authors.
