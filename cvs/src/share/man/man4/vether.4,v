.Dt VETHER 4
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm vether
.Nd virtual Ethernet interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "pseudo-device vether"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
interface simulates a normal Ethernet interface by encapsulating
standard network frames with an Ethernet header, specifically
for use as a member in a
.Xr bridge 4 .
.Pp
To use
.Nm
the administrator needs to configure an address onto the interface
so that packets can be routed to it.
An Ethernet header will be prepended and, if the
.Nm
interface is a member of a
.Xr bridge 4 ,
the frame will show up there.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr bridge 4 ,
.Xr inet 4 ,
.Xr inet6 4 ,
.Xr hostname.if 5 ,
.Xr ifconfig 8 ,
.Xr netstart 8
.Sh BUGS
Like
.Xr tun 4 ,
the Ethernet address chosen will be partially random, and may
occasionally collide with another address.

1.1
log
@vether(4) is a virtual ethernet device driver which can be used
so that a bridge-etherip-tunnel host can join into the bridge itself.
It is ridiculous that this capability was missing from our network
stack portfolio, considering we have bgp and ospf daemons...
discussed at length with claudio
