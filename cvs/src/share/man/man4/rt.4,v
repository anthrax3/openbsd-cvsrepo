.Sh NAME
.Nm rt
.Nd AIMS Lab Radiotrack FM radio device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "rt0   at isa? port 0x30c"
.Cd "rt1   at isa? port 0x20c"
.Cd "rt*   at isapnp?"
.Cd "radio* at rt?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the AIMS Lab Radiotrack FM radio tuners and
compatible \- RadioReveal RA300 FM radio tuners and tuners at
SoundForte RadioX SF16-FMI (Creative ViBRA16C PnP).
.Pp
The Radiotrack is a stereo FM tuner that can tune in the range
87.5 \- 108.0 MHz, report signal status on the current frequency, and
force audio output to mono.
.Pp
The card is based on the LM7000 chip; see
.Xr radio 4
for details.
.Pp
The Radiotrack cards take only one I/O port.
The I/O port is set by the driver to the value specified in
the configuration file and must be either 0x20c or 0x30c.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr intro 4 ,
.Xr isa 4 ,
.Xr isapnp 4 ,
.Xr radio 4 ,
.Xr radio 9
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
device driver appeared in
.Ox 3.0 .
.Sh AUTHORS
.An -nosplit
The
.Nm
driver was written by
.An Vladimir Popov Aq Mt jumbo@@narod.ru
and
.An Maxim Tsyplakov Aq Mt tm@@oganer.net .
The man page was written by
.An Vladimir Popov Aq Mt jumbo@@narod.ru .
.Sh BUGS
Support for the SF16-FMI cards is rather ugly, the driver cannot
determine signal state and force audio output to mono.
.Pp
It is impossible to determine which frequency the card is tuned to.
Thus, the driver will report an internally stored value even if it is not
correct (e.g. tuning was done through the direct I/O access).

@Incomplete section 4 mi manual page cleanup.
- make configuration lines match GENERIC files
- more Xr (hopefully usefule Xr)
- never mention intro(4) on non-physical devices (i.e. protocols), always
mention it for physical devices
- random text style and quoting fixes
- drivers ported from FreeBSD did mention rc.conf instead of hostname.if as
the place to put mediaopt
- some .Tn UNIX -> .Ox replacements
- etc, etc...
