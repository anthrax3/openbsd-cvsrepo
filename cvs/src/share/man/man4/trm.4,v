@Use .Lk for HTTP hyperlinks, not .Pa.
Most of the patch from Arto Jonsson <ajonsson at kapsi dot fi>.
jmc@@ agrees in principle that .Lk is the right macro to use.

While here, update a few broken links,
and add missing markup at a few places.

1.2
log
@Incomplete section 4 mi manual page cleanup.
- make configuration lines match GENERIC files
- more Xr (hopefully usefule Xr)
- never mention intro(4) on non-physical devices (i.e. protocols), always
mention it for physical devices
- random text style and quoting fixes
- drivers ported from FreeBSD did mention rc.conf instead of hostname.if as
the place to put mediaopt
- some .Tn UNIX -> .Ox replacements
- etc, etc...

log
@Add trm - driver for Tekram TRM-S1040 cards (DC395U/UW/F,DC315/U).

Thanks to Tekram for donating a couple of cards and a NetBSD driver by
Erich Chen of Tekram. Thanks to Martin Akesson for a first port of the
NetBSD driver to OpenBSD and thanks to Ashley Martens for the major
cleanup to make it presentable and style(9)ish.

Only tested on i386 at this time.
