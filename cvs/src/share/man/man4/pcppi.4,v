.Sh NAME
.Nm pcppi
.Nd PC (ISA) control and timer port driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "pcppi*   at isa?"
.Cd "spkr0    at pcppi?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver handles resource allocation and device attachment for the
ports related to the ISA speaker in the traditional PC/AT
.Dq design .
These are the
.Dq system control port
(which was implemented by the 8255
.Dq PPI
in the XT, hence the name of this driver)
at I/O address 0x61 and the first 8253 timer at 0x40-0x43.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver provides its child devices with the ability to output simple
tones through the PC speaker.
The
.Xr speaker 4
device uses this to synthesize sounds.
It also provides helper functions to the
.Xr pckbd 4
driver as a substitute for a
.Dq keyboard beep ,
because the PC keyboard hardware doesn't provide this.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr intro 4 ,
.Xr isa 4 ,
.Xr pckbd 4 ,
.Xr speaker 4

@Incomplete section 4 mi manual page cleanup.
- make configuration lines match GENERIC files
- more Xr (hopefully usefule Xr)
- never mention intro(4) on non-physical devices (i.e. protocols), always
mention it for physical devices
- random text style and quoting fixes
- drivers ported from FreeBSD did mention rc.conf instead of hostname.if as
the place to put mediaopt
- some .Tn UNIX -> .Ox replacements
- etc, etc...
