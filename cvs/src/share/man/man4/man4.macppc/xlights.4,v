.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "xlights* at macobio?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the on-board i2s virtual sound device
that drives the front panel LEDs of Apple G4 and G5 Xserve machines.
.Pp
The lights provide an indication of system load and health.
System load is indicated by three dots travelling in a ring around the sixteen
LEDs found on the front panel.
When the system is lightly loaded these dots travel quickly and slow down
as system load increases.
System health is indicated by the absence of the dots which
means a hung machine or one that is in
.Xr ddb 4 .
