.Sh NAME
.Nm dfs
.Nd Dynamic Frequency Switching
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "dfs* at macgpio?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the Dynamic Frequency Switching
feature found on some PowerPC microprocessors.
.Pp
It conserves power by lowering the processor operating frequency.
Depending on the processor model, the processor-to-system bus ratio can
be divided by two or four.
.Sh HARDWARE
Processors supported by the
.Nm
driver are part of the PowerPC G4 family and are found on various iBook
and PowerBook machines:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
MPC7447A	PowerPC 7447 "Apollo 7"
MPC7448		PowerPC 7448 "Apollo 8"
