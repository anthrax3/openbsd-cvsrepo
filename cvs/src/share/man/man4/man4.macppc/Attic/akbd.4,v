.Dt AKBD 4 macppc
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm akbd
.Nd Apple Keyboard Device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "akbd* at adb?"
.Cd "wskbd* at akbd? mux 1"
.Cd "option AKBD_LAYOUT=XXX"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This driver supports ADB keyboards within the
.Xr wscons 4
console framework.
It doesn't provide direct device driver entry points but makes its
functions available via the internal
.Xr wskbd 4
interface.
.Pp
The following is a partial list of supported
.Tn AKBD
devices:
.Bd -filled -offset indent
.Bl -item -compact
.It
Apple Standard Keyboard
.It
Apple Extended Keyboard
.It
Apple Keyboard II
.It
Apple PowerBook Keyboard
.It
Apple Adjustable Keyboard
.It
Apple PowerBook extended Keyboard
.It
Apple PowerBook G3 Keyboard
.It
Apple PowerBook G4 Keyboard
.It
Apple iBook Keyboard
.It
.El
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports a number of different key mappings which
can be chosen from with the kernel option
.Dq AKBD_LAYOUT
at compile time or with the utility
.Xr wsconsctl 8
(variable:
.Dq keyboard.encoding
) at runtime.
Other mappings can be used if the whole keymap is replaced by means of
.Xr wsconsctl 8 .
The built-in mappings are at this time:
.Bl -hang
.It KB_DE
(
.Dq de
) German with
.Dq dead accents .
.It KB_FR
(
.Dq fr
) French.
.It KB_JP
(
.Dq jp
) Japanese.
.It KB_PT
(
.Dq pt
) Portuguese.
.It KB_SF
(
.Dq sf
) Swiss French with
.Dq dead accents .
.It KB_SG
(
.Dq sg
) Swiss German with
.Dq dead accents .
.It KB_SV
(
.Dq sv
) Swedish with
.Dq dead accents .
.It KB_UK
(
.Dq uk
) British.
.It KB_US
(
.Dq us
) English / US keyboard mapping (default).
.El
.Pp
The KB_DE, KB_SG and KB_SV mappings can be used in the KB_NODEAD (
.Dq .nodead
) variant.
This switches off the
.Dq dead accents .
.Sh EXAMPLES
To set a German keyboard layout without
.Dq dead accents ,
use
.Ic wsconsctl -w keyboard.encoding=de.nodead .
To set it at kernel build time, add
the following to the kernel configuration file:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
option AKBD_LAYOUT="KB_DE|KB_NODEAD"
.Ed
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr adb 4 ,
.Xr intro 4 ,
.Xr ukbd 4 ,
.Xr wskbd 4 ,
.Xr wsconsctl 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
interface first appeared in
.Nx 0.9 .
It has been under development ever since.
.Sh AUTHORS
Bradley A. Grantham wrote the original
.Nm
driver, including the
.Tn MRG
support.
The hardware direct interface was written by John P. Wittkowski.
.Sh BUGS
The list of built-in mappings doesn't follow any logic.
It grew as people submitted what they needed.

@use a display instead of .Em for the kernel config line: avoids nasty
line splits, and it should be `literal' anyway;

- remove gm(4) superseded by gem(4)
- more .Xr
- fix .Cd lines
- bring akbd(4) contents in sync with reality (blatantly inspired from

- the usual intro(4) update
