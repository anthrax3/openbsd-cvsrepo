.Sh NAME
.Nm adb
.Nd introduction to Apple Desktop Bus support
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "adb0 at macobio?"
.Cd "abtn* at adb?"
.Cd "akbd* at adb?"
.Cd "ams* at adb?"
.Cd "apm0 at adb?"
.Cd "piic0 at adb?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The Apple Desktop Bus
.Pq Tn ADB
is the single-master, multiple-slave, low-speed serial bus
interface used by Macintosh computers to connect input devices
such as keyboards, mice, trackballs, and graphics tablets
to the machine.
.Pp
Originally developed for the Mac68K port, the
.Nm
driver was heavily modified when it was ported to the PowerPC architecture.
During this port it seems that the original
.Nm
event device was split into many smaller subsystems, namely:
.Pp
.Bl -enum -compact
.It
Apple Keyboard driver
.Pq Xr akbd 4 .
.It
Apple Mouse Support driver
.Pq Xr ams 4 .
.El
.Pp
New
.Nm
devices such as the Apple Brightness / Volume Control Button
.Pq Xr abtn 4 ,
some energy control
.Pq Xr apm 4 ,
and I2C controller
.Pq Xr piic 4
were added to the PowerPC port later to complement the ADB system.
.Pp
.Ox
provides support for the following devices:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "abtn(4)XX" -offset 3n -compact
.It Xr abtn 4
Apple brightness/volume/eject button control
.It Xr akbd 4
Apple Keyboard Device
.It Xr ams 4
Apple Mouse Support
.It Xr apm 4
advanced power management device interface
.It Xr piic 4
Apple via-pmu I2C controller
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr intro 4
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
interface first appeared in
.Nx 0.9 .
It has been under development ever since.
The original
.Nm adb
manpage was written by Colin Wood for
.Nx Ns / Ns Mac68K.
.Sh AUTHORS
.An -nosplit
Original ADB support was written by
.An Bradley A. Grantham .
The direct ADB routines were written by
