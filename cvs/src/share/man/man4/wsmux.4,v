@First pass at removing clauses 3 and 4 from NetBSD licenses.

Not sure what's more surprising: how long it took for NetBSD to
catch up to the rest of the BSDs (including UCB), or the amount of
code that NetBSD has claimed for itself without attributing to the
actual authors.

.Sh NAME
.Nm wsmux
.Nd console keyboard/mouse multiplexor for wscons
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "wskbd*     at ... mux N"
.Cd "wsmouse*   at ... mux N"
.Pp
.Cd "pseudo-device wsmux" Op Ar count
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
is a pseudo-device driver that allows several
.Xr wscons 4
input devices to have their events multiplexed into one stream.
.Pp
The typical usage for this device is to have two multiplexors, one
for mouse events and one for keyboard events.
All
.Xr wsmouse 4
devices should direct their events to the mouse mux (normally 0)
and all keyboard devices, except the console, should direct their
events to the keyboard mux (normally 1).
A device will send its events to the mux indicated by the
.Va mux
locator.
If none is given the device will not use a multiplexor.
The keyboard multiplexor should be connected to the display, using
the
.Xr wsconscfg 8
command.
It will then receive all keystrokes from all keyboards and, furthermore,
keyboards can be dynamically attached and detached without further
user interaction.
In a similar way, the window system will open the mouse multiplexor
and receive all mouse events; mice can also be dynamically attached
and detached.
.Pp
It is also possible to inject events into a multiplexor from a user program.
This is used by the
.Xr wsmoused 8
daemon to take data from a mouse connected to a serial port and
make it appear on the standard mouse mux.
