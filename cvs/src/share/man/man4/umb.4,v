.Sh NAME
.Nm umb
.Nd USB Mobile Broadband Interface Model (MBIM)
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "umb*  at uhub?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for USB MBIM devices.
.Pp
MBIM devices establish connections via cellular networks such as
GPRS, UMTS, and LTE.
They appear as a regular point-to-point network interface,
transporting raw IP frames.
.Pp
Required configuration parameters like PIN and APN have to be set
with
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
Once the SIM card has been unlocked with the correct PIN, it
will remain in this state until the MBIM device is power-cycled.
In case the device is connected to an "always-on" USB port,
it may be possible to connect to a provider without entering the
PIN again even if the system was rebooted.
.Sh HARDWARE
The following devices should work:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent -compact
.It Ericsson H5321gw and N5321gw
.It Medion Mobile S4222 (MediaTek OEM)
.It Sierra Wireless EM7455
.It Sierra Wireless EM8805
.It Sierra Wireless MC8305
.El

.%U http://www.usb.org/developers/docs/devclass_docs/MBIM10Errata1_073013.zip
.Re
.Sh CAVEATS
The
.Nm
driver does not support IPv6.
.Pp
Devices which fail to provide a conforming MBIM implementation will
probably be attached as some other driver, such as
.Xr umsm 4 .

@Add umb(4) - a driver for the Mobile Broadband Interface Model (MBIM)

The umb(4) driver provides support for USB MBIM devices.
Those devices establish connections via celluar networks such as
GPRS, UMTS, and LTE.

.Pp
If a default gateway route is configured for the

network interface, the driver will modify the destination IP address
dynamically, according to the information sent by the network provider.

The following devices are known to be supported by the

driver:

.Pp
There are probably a lot more devices that also work flawlessly.
If some devices fail to provide a confirming MBIM implementation,
their vendor and product IDs should be added to the driver's blacklist
manually.
Since most devices offer multiple interfaces, blacklisted ones will
probably be attached by some other driver, such as
.Xr umsm 4 .
