.Sh NAME
.Nm le
.Nd AMD 7990 LANCE ethernet interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "le* at obio0 addr ? level ?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
interface provides access to the 10 Mb/s
.Tn Ethernet
network via the
.Tn AMD
Am7990
Local Area Network Controller for Ethernet
.Pq Tn LANCE
chip set.
.Pp
Each of the host's network addresses
is specified at boot time with an
.Dv SIOCSIFADDR
.Xr ioctl 2 .
The
.Nm
interface employs the address resolution protocol described in
.Xr arp 4
to dynamically map between Internet and
.Tn Ethernet
addresses on the local network.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr arp 4 ,
.Xr ie 4 ,
.Xr inet 4 ,
.Xr intro 4

o) AUTHOR -> AUTHORS;
o) Start new sentence on a new line;
o) For URL and path names use .Pa;
o) We don't like .Pp before .Rs;
o) Don't use .Pp before/after .Sh;
o) OpenBSD -> .Ox;

@- remove all trailing whitespace
     * except when it is escaped with a `\' at the end of the line
- fix remaining .Nm usage as well
- this is from a patch I received from kwesterback@@home.com, who has been
  working on some scripts for fixing formatting errors in mdoc'd man pages

Ok, so there could be a cost/benefit debate with this commit, but since I have
the patch we might as well commit it...
