@amiga and sun3 turned out to not be y2k+3 compliant here. Remove them, as
well as the few userland tools which were only used on these platforms.

.Sh NAME
.Nm mem ,
.Nm kmem
.Nd main memory
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The file
.Nm /dev/mem
is an interface to the physical memory of the
computer.
Byte offsets in this file are interpreted as physical memory addresses.
Reading and writing this file is equivalent to reading and writing
memory itself.
An error will be returned if an attempt is made to reference
an offset outside of
.Nm /dev/mem .
.Pp
Kernel virtual memory is accessed via the file
.Nm /dev/kmem
in the same manner as
.Nm /dev/mem .
Only kernel virtual addresses that are currently mapped to memory are allowed.
.Pp
On the
.Tn Sun3 ,
physical memory may be discontiguous;
kernel virtual memory begins at
.Li 0x0e000000 .
.Pp
Writeability of these devices is controlled by the system
.Xr securelevel 7 .
