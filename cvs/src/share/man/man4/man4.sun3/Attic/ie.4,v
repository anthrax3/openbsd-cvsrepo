.Sh NAME
.Nm ie
.Nd Intel 82586 Ethernet interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "ie0 at obio0 addr ? level ?"
.Cd "ie1 at vmes0 addr 0xffe88000 level 3 vect 0x75"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
interface provides access to the 10 Mb/s Ethernet network via the
.Tn Intel
82586 Ethernet chip set.
The
.Nm
is found as an on-board interface on Sun 3/75, 3/1x0 and 3/2x0
workstations.
The
.Nm
also exists as a VME card.
.Pp
Each of the host's network addresses
is specified at boot time with an
.Dv SIOCSIFADDR
.Xr ioctl 2 .
The
.Nm
interface employs the address resolution protocol described in
.Xr arp 4
to dynamically map between Internet and Ethernet addresses on the local
network.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr arp 4 ,
.Xr inet 4 ,
.Xr intro 4 ,
.Xr le 4

@- remove all trailing whitespace
     * except when it is escaped with a `\' at the end of the line
- fix remaining .Nm usage as well
- this is from a patch I received from kwesterback@@home.com, who has been
  working on some scripts for fixing formatting errors in mdoc'd man pages

Ok, so there could be a cost/benefit debate with this commit, but since I have
the patch we might as well commit it...
