.Sh NAME
.Nm itherm
.Nd Intel 3400 temperature sensor
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "itherm* at pci?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for several sensors found in Intel 3400 and 5 series
chipsets.
.Pp
The sensors currently exposed via the
.Xr sysctl 8
interface are:
.Bl -column "CPU power cons." "Units" "Typical Use" -offset indent
.It Sy "Sensor" Ta Sy "Units" Ta Sy "Typical Use"
.It Li "Thermometer" Ta "degC" Ta "Temperature"
.It Li "Core 1" Ta "degC" Ta "Temperature"
.It Li "Core 2" Ta "degC" Ta "Temperature"
.It Li "CPU power cons." Ta "Watts" Ta "Power usage"
.It Li "CPU/GPU Max" Ta "degC" Ta "Temperature"
.It Li "DIMM 1" Ta "degC" Ta "Temperature"
.It Li "DIMM 2" Ta "degC" Ta "Temperature"
.It Li "DIMM 3" Ta "degC" Ta "Temperature"
.It Li "DIMM 4" Ta "degC" Ta "Temperature"
.It Li "GPU abs." Ta "degC" Ta "Temperature"
.It Li "PCH abs." Ta "degC" Ta "Temperature"
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr pci 4 ,
.Xr sensorsd 8 ,
.Xr sysctl 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver first appeared in
.Ox 4.8 .
.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Nm
driver was written by
.An Mike Larkin Aq Mt mlarkin@@openbsd.org .
.Sh CAVEATS
Not all sensors are wired on every machine, so the list of
sensors shown in
.Xr sysctl 8
may not show all the sensors listed above.
Furthermore, the
.Nm
driver will flag sensors as invalid if they report bogus data.

log
@make -column lists pretty again;

specifically, rewrite them to permit some markup in the column headers,
and use "Ta" instead of literal tabs; mandoc does not currently match groff
100%, but a mandoc fix may be some time off, and we've gone enough releases
with poorly formatting column lists.

in some cases i have rewritten the lists as -tag, where -column made
little sense.
