.Sh NAME
.Nm pcn
.Nd AMD PCnet-PCI 10/100 Ethernet device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "pcn* at pci?"
.Cd "acphy* at mii?"
.Cd "amphy* at mii?"
.Cd "lxtphy* at mii?"
.Cd "nsphy* at mii?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
device driver supports Ethernet interfaces based on the AMD
PCnet-PCI family of Ethernet chips.
The chips supported by the
.Nm
driver include:
.Bl -bullet
.It
Am79c970 PCnet-PCI Single-Chip Ethernet Controller for PCI
Local Bus
.It
Am79c970A PCnet-PCI II Single-Chip Full-Duplex Ethernet Controller
for PCI Local Bus
.It
Am79c971 PCnet-FAST Single-Chip Full-Duplex 10/100Mbps
Ethernet Controller for PCI Local Bus
.It
Am79c972 PCnet-FAST+ Enhanced 10/100Mbps PCI Ethernet Controller
with OnNow Support
.It
Am79c973/Am79c975 PCnet-FAST III Single-Chip 10/100Mbps PCI
Ethernet Controller with Integrated PHY
.El
.Pp
PCnet-PCI chips are found on some Hewlett-Packard PCI Ethernet
boards, and on the Allied Telesyn AT-2700TX PCI Ethernet board.
They are also found on some processor evaluation boards as an
example peripheral.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver also supports the emulated PCnet-PCI interface provided
by VMware.
