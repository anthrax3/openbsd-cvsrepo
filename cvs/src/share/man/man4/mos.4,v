.Sh NAME
.Nm mos
.Nd MosChip MCS7730/7830/7832 10/100 USB Ethernet device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "mos*   at uhub?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for USB Ethernet adapters based on the MosChip
MCS7730, MCS7830 and MCS7832 USB 2.0 chipsets, including the
following:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent -compact
.It Delock 61147
.It Sitecom LN-030
.It Syba SY-U2LAN
.El
.Pp
All adapters operate with either USB 1.x or USB 2.0 controllers,
though performance with 1.x controllers is limited since
the USB 1.x standard specifies a maximum transfer speed of 12Mbps.
Users with USB 1.x controllers should therefore not expect to actually
achieve 100Mbps speeds with these devices.
.Pp
A 64-bit multicast hash table is supported,
single perfect filter entry for the station address,
all-multicast mode, and promiscuous mode.
Packets are
received and transmitted over separate USB bulk transfer endpoints.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media types:
.Bl -tag -width "autoselect"
.It autoselect
Enable autoselection of the media type and options (this is the default).
The user can manually override the autoselected mode by adding media
options to the appropriate
.Xr hostname.if 5
file.
.It 10baseT
Set 10Mbps operation.
.It 100baseTX
Set 100Mbps (Fast Ethernet) operation.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media options:
.Bl -tag -width "full-duplex"
.It full-duplex
Force full-duplex operation.
.It half-duplex
Force half-duplex operation.
.El
.Pp
For more information on configuring this device, see
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "mos0: watchdog timeout"
A packet was queued for transmission and a transmit command was
issued, however the device failed to acknowledge the transmission
before a timeout expired.
.It "mos0: no memory for rx list"
The driver failed to allocate an mbuf for the receiver ring.

@within Rs/Re reference blocks, use %U instead of %O (or any other
variants) for URLs, allowing mandoc -Thtml to properly generate links;

(sendmail.8 changes are simply using Lk, which i somehow missed in previous)

ingo reminded me to verify that gnu groff recognises %U: 1.20.1 does not,
but 1.21 does;

All adapters will operate with either USB 1.x or USB 2.0 controllers, however
performance with 1.x controllers will be limited since the USB 1.x standard
specifies a maximum transfer speed of 12Mbps.
