.Sh NAME
.Nm lisa
.Nd STMicroelectronics LIS331DL MEMS motion sensor
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "lisa* at iic?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the ST LIS331DL
3-axis digital output accelerometer.
A total of 3 sensors are provided, one for each axis
(X, Y and Z).
Each reading from LIS331DL is represented by an
8-bit 2's complement number.
.Pp
Sensor values are made available through the
.Dv HW_SENSORS
.Xr sysctl 3
interface,
and can be monitored with the
.Xr systat 1
.Ar sensors
view,
.Xr sensorsd 8
and
.Xr sysctl 8
.Ar hw.sensors .

@within Rs/Re reference blocks, use %U instead of %O (or any other
variants) for URLs, allowing mandoc -Thtml to properly generate links;

(sendmail.8 changes are simply using Lk, which i somehow missed in previous)

ingo reminded me to verify that gnu groff recognises %U: 1.20.1 does not,
but 1.21 does;
