.Dt MPBIOS 4 i386
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm mpbios
.Nd MP BIOS
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "mpbios0 at bios0"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver extracts configuration information from the BIOS on
multiprocessor systems that conform to the Intel MultiProcessor
Specification.
This information is used to attach application processors and APICs,
and to assign interrupts to ISA, EISA and PCI devices.
.Pp
On modern systems this information is provided by ACPI through the
.Xr acpimadt 4
device.
On such a system
.Nm
will not attach, even if the BIOS also contains the data structures
specified by the Intel MP Specification.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports version 1.1 and 1.4 of the Intel MP Specification.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr acpi 4 ,
.Xr acpimadt 4 ,
.Xr bios 4 ,
.Xr cpu 4 ,
.Xr intro 4 ,
.Xr ioapic 4 ,
.Xr pcibios 4
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver first appeared in
.Ox 4.5 ,
based on code present since
.Ox 3.6 .
