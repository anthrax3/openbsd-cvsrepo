@Reduce instances of `` '' in manuals.

troff displays these as typographic quotes, but nroff implementations
almost always print them literally, which rarely has the intended effect
with modern fonts, even in stock xterm.

These uses of `` '' can be replaced either with more semantic alternatives
or with Dq, which prints typographic quotes in a UTF-8 locale (but will
automatically fall back to `` '' in an ASCII locale).

.Sh NAME
.Nm tcpcib
.Nd Intel Atom E600 series LPC bridge, timecounter and watchdog timer
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "tcpcib* at pci?"
.Cd "isa* at tcpcib?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the Intel Atom E600 series LPC bridge and
implements a 64-bit 14.3 MHz timecounter using the HPET timer.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver also provides the standard
.Xr watchdog 4
interface to the watchdog timer and may be used with
.Xr watchdogd 8 .
The watchdog timer can be configured via
.Xr sysctl 8 .
.Pp
Once the watchdog timer resets the CPU, the driver reports it on the
next boot displaying the
.Dq reboot on timeout
message in the
.Xr dmesg 8 .
.Pp
The maximum timeout value supported by the watchdog timer is 600
seconds.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr intro 4 ,
.Xr isa 4 ,
.Xr pci 4 ,
.Xr watchdog 4 ,
.Xr sysctl 8 ,
.Xr watchdogd 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver first appeared in
.Ox 5.2 .
.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Nm
driver was written by
.An Matt Dainty Aq Mt matt@@bodgit-n-scarper.com .
.Sh BUGS
Apart from the core
.Xr pcib 4
functionality, timecounter and the
.Xr watchdog 4
interface, the driver doesn't support any other aspects of the hardware.
