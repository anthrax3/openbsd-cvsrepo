.Sh NAME
.Nm elansc
.Nd AMD Elan SC520 System Controller with watchdog timer and GPIO
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "elansc* at pci?"
.Cd "gpio* at elansc?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver supports the system controller of the AMD Elan SC520 microcontroller.
The SC520 consists of an AMD Am5x86 processor core, integrated PCI host
controller, and several standard on-chip devices, such as NS16550-compatible
UARTs, real-time clock, and timers.
.Pp
The Elan SC520 also provides several special on-chip devices.
The following are supported by the
.Nm
driver:
.Bl -bullet
.It
Watchdog timer.
The watchdog timer may be configured for a 1 second, 2 second, 4 second,
8 second, 16 second, or 32 second expiration period.
.It
Programmable Input/Output.
The SC520 microcontroller supports 32 programmable I/O signals (PIOs)
that can be used on the system board to monitor signals or control devices
that are not handled by the other functions in the SC520 microcontroller.
These signals can be programmed to be inputs or to be driven out
.Dq high
or
.Dq low
as outputs.
Pins can be accessed through the
.Xr gpio 4
framework.
The
.Xr gpioctl 8
program allows easy manipulation of pins from userland.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr gpio 4 ,
.Xr intro 4 ,
.Xr watchdog 4 ,
.Xr gpioctl 8 ,
.Xr sysctl 8
.Sh HISTORY
Support for the
.Nm
was added in
.Ox 3.3 .
PIO function support appeared in
.Ox 3.6 .
.Sh AUTHORS
.An -nosplit
The
.Nm
driver was written by
.An Jason R. Thorpe Aq Mt thorpej@@netbsd.org .
.An Jasper Wallace
provided the work-around for a hardware bug related to the watchdog timer
in some steppings of the SC520 CPU.
.An Alexander Yurchenko Aq Mt grange@@openbsd.org
added support for the PIO function.

@First pass at removing clauses 3 and 4 from NetBSD licenses.

Not sure what's more surprising: how long it took for NetBSD to
catch up to the rest of the BSDs (including UCB), or the amount of
code that NetBSD has claimed for itself without attributing to the
actual authors.

@GPIO improvements:

- make "man -k gpio" work
- gpioctl(8) should not try to list all gpio devices (it's why we have man -k)
- gpio devices should have "GPIO" in their .Nd, and cross-reference gpio(4)
and gpioctl(8)

second set of fixes for gpio(4) itself coming from mbalmer...

It's unwise to combine the watchdog timer of
