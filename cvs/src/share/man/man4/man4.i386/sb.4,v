.Nm sb
.Nd SoundBlaster family audio device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "sb0 at isa? port 0x220 irq 5 drq 1"
.Cd "sb1 at isa? port 0x240 irq 7 drq 1 flags 1"
.Cd "sb* at isapnp?"
.Cd "audio* at sb?"
.Cd "midi* at sb?" Pq "MPU401 port"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver supports the
SoundBlaster 16, Jazz 16, SoundBlaster AWE 32, SoundBlaster AWE 64,
and hardware register-level compatible audio cards.
.Pp
The SoundBlaster series are half-duplex cards, capable of 8- and 16-bit
audio sample recording and playback at rates up to 44.1kHz (depending on
the particular model).
.Pp
The base I/O port address is usually jumper-selected to either 0x220 or
0x240 (newer cards may provide software configuration, but this driver
does not directly support them--you must configure the card for its I/O
addresses with other software).
The SoundBlaster takes 16 I/O ports.
For the SoundBlaster and SoundBlaster Pro, the IRQ and DRQ channels are
jumper-selected.
For the SoundBlaster 16, the IRQ and DRQ channels are set by this driver
to the values specified in the config file.
The IRQ must be selected from the set {5,7,9,10}.
.Pp
The configuration file must set the value of
.Cm flags
to 1 to enable the Jazz16 support.
This is to avoid potential conflicts with other devices when probing the
Jazz 16 because it requires use of extra I/O ports not in the base port range.
.Pp
The joystick interface (if enabled by a jumper) is handled by the
.Xr joy 4
driver, and the optional SCSI CD-ROM interface is handled by the
.Xr aic 4
driver.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr aic 4 ,
.Xr audio 4 ,
.Xr intro 4 ,
.Xr isa 4 ,
.Xr isapnp 4 ,
.Xr joy 4 ,
.Xr midi 4
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
device driver appeared in
.Nx 1.0 .
.Sh BUGS
With a SoundBlaster 16 card the device is full duplex, but it can
only sensibly handle a precision of 8 bits.
It does so by extending
the output 8 bit samples to 16 bits and using the 8 bit DMA channel
for input and the 16 bit channel for output.
.Pp
The non-SCSI CD-ROM interfaces found on some older cards are not supported.

@First pass at removing clauses 3 and 4 from NetBSD licenses.

Not sure what's more surprising: how long it took for NetBSD to
catch up to the rest of the BSDs (including UCB), or the amount of
code that NetBSD has claimed for itself without attributing to the
actual authors.

@Manpage cleaning police:
- more and better .Xr
- prefer "option FOO" rather than "options FOO", and put the option
  lines after the device definition lines in SYNOPSIS
- identify these manpages as section 4/i386, not section 4.
- long awaited update to intro(4/i386)
- npx(4/i386) was too NetBSD-ish - we only provide one math emulator
- random touches
