.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "pseudo-device nvram 1"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
device provides read-only access to the non-volatile memory contained in the
MC146818 real-time clock.
.Pp
This data is provided as a seekable character device,
.Pa /dev/nvram .
Checksums of the NVRAM contents are calculated over bytes 2 to 31 and stored
in byte 32.
A valid checksum is required for the driver to initialize.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /dev/nvram
.It Pa /dev/nvram

Only one process may have this device open at any given time;
.Xr open 2
and
.Xr close 2
are used to lock and relinquish it.
An attempt to
.Fn open
when another process has the device locked will return \-1 with an
.Er EBUSY
error indication.
