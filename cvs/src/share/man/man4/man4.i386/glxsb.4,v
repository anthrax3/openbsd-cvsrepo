.Sh NAME
.Nm glxsb
.Nd Geode LX Security Block crypto accelerator
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "glxsb* at pci?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver supports the security block of the Geode LX series processors.
The Geode LX is a member of the AMD Geode family
of integrated x86 system chips.
.Pp
Driven by periodic checks for available data from the generator,
.Nm
supplies entropy to the
.Xr random 4
driver for common usage.
.Pp
.Nm
also supports acceleration of AES-CBC operations for
.Xr ipsec 4 .
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr intro 4 ,
.Xr ipsec 4 ,
.Xr pci 4 ,
.Xr random 4 ,
.Xr crypto 9
.Sh HISTORY
Support for
.Nm
was added in
.Ox 4.1 .
.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Nm
driver was written by
.An Tom Cosgrove .

.Sh BUGS
The
.Nm
driver only provides random numbers and AES acceleration.
Since it does not provide HMACs, IPSec will not currently use it;
it will however be used by OpenSSH.

@Driver for the AMD Geode LX series processor security block.
Currently just uses the RNG; AES support to be added later.
