.Sh NAME
.Nm joy
.Nd games adapter
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "joy0 at isa? port 0x201"
.Cd "joy* at isapnp?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This driver provides access to the games adapter.
The lower bit in the minor device number selects the joystick: 0 is the first
joystick and 1 is the second.
.Pp
The game control adapter allows up to two joysticks to be attached to
the system.
The adapter plus the driver convert the present resistive value to a relative
joystick position.
On receipt of an output signal, four timing circuits are started.
By determining the time required for the circuit to time-out (a function of
the resistance), the paddle position can be determined.
The adapter could be used as a general purpose I/O card with four
analog (resistive) inputs plus four digital input points.
.Pp
Applications may call
.Fn ioctl
on a game adapter driver file descriptor
to set and get the offsets of the two potentiometers and the maximum
time-out value for the circuit.
The
.Fn ioctl
commands are listed in
.In machine/joystick.h
and currently are:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width JOY_GET_X_OFFSET -offset indent -compact
.It JOY_SETTIMEOUT
Sets the maximum time-out for the adapter.
.It JOY_GETTIMEOUT
Returns the current maximum time-out.
.It JOY_SET_X_OFFSET
Sets an offset on X value.
.It JOY_GET_X_OFFSET
Returns the current X offset.
.It JOY_SET_Y_OFFSET
Sets an offset on Y value.
.It JOY_GET_Y_OFFSET
Returns the current Y offset.
.El
.Pp
All of these commands take an integer parameter.
.Pp
Read() on the file descriptor returns a
.Fa joystick
structure:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
struct joystick {
	int x;
	int y;
	int b1;
	int b2;
};
.Ed
.Pp
The fields have the following functions:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width xxx -offset indent -compact
.It Fa x
Joystick's current X coordinate (or position of paddle 1).
.It Fa y
Joystick's current Y coordinate (or position of paddle 2).
.It Fa b1
Current state of button 1.
.It Fa b2
Current state of button 2.
.El
.Pp
The
.Fa b1
and
.Fa b2
fields in struct joystick are set to 1 if the corresponding button is down,
or 0 otherwise.
.Pp
The X and Y coordinates are supposed to be between 0 and 255 for a
good joystick and a good adapter.
Unfortunately, because of the hardware hack that is used to measure the
position (by measuring the time needed to discharge an RC circuit made from
the joystick's potentiometer and a capacitor on the adapter), calibration
is needed to determine exactly what values are returned for a specific
joystick/adapter combination.
Incorrect hardware can yield negative or > 255 values.
.Pp
A typical calibration procedure uses the values returned at lower-left,
center, and upper-right positions of the joystick to compute the relative
position.
.Pp
This calibration is not part of the driver.

@Manpage cleaning police:
- more and better .Xr
- prefer "option FOO" rather than "options FOO", and put the option
  lines after the device definition lines in SYNOPSIS
- identify these manpages as section 4/i386, not section 4.
- long awaited update to intro(4/i386)
- npx(4/i386) was too NetBSD-ish - we only provide one math emulator
- random touches

@- remove all trailing whitespace
     * except when it is escaped with a `\' at the end of the line
- fix remaining .Nm usage as well
- this is from a patch I received from kwesterback@@home.com, who has been
  working on some scripts for fixing formatting errors in mdoc'd man pages

Ok, so there could be a cost/benefit debate with this commit, but since I have
the patch we might as well commit it...
