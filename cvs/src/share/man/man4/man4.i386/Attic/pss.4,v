.Sh NAME
.Nm pss
.Nd Personal Sound System audio device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "pss0 at isa? port 0x220 irq 7 drq 6"
.Cd "sp0 at pss0 port 0x530 irq 10 drq 0"
.Cd "audio* at sp?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver supports sound cards based on ESC614 or ESC614A ASICs and AD1848
or CS4231 series codecs.
Known examples are:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent -compact
.It Cardinal Digital Sound Pro 16
.It Orchid SoundWave 32
.El
.Pp
The Orchid GameWave 32 is based on the ESC614 ASIC, but not
supported because it does not have a codec.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver uses the Windows Sound System emulation mode of the ASIC.
It is a half-duplex device.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr audio 4 ,
.Xr intro 4 ,
.Xr isa 4 ,
.Xr wss 4
.Sh BUGS
This driver doesn't work yet.
.Pp
The list of cards using the PSS chipset is incomplete.
.Pp
The ESC614 (version 1) is unable to reliably determine whether DMA
channels are free on some motherboards.
The ASIC determines that all channels are taken, even if that is untrue.
When this happens, the driver cannot verify configured DMA channels with the
ASIC's DMA autodetect hardware, so it blindly accepts the user setting.
.Pp
Cards based on the ESC615 ASIC are not supported.
.Pp
The MIDI port, joystick, and CD-ROM drive (if present) are not supported.

log
@Manpage cleaning police:
- more and better .Xr
- prefer "option FOO" rather than "options FOO", and put the option
  lines after the device definition lines in SYNOPSIS
- identify these manpages as section 4/i386, not section 4.
- long awaited update to intro(4/i386)
- npx(4/i386) was too NetBSD-ish - we only provide one math emulator
- random touches
