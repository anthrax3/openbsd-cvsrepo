.Nd Adaptec 154x SCSI adapter driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "aha0 at isa? port 0x330 irq ? drq ?"
.Cd "scsibus* at aha?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the following SCSI adapters:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width -offset indent -compact
.It Adaptec AHA-1540
.It Adaptec AHA-154xA
.It Adaptec AHA-154xB
.It Adaptec AHA-1542C

.It Adaptec AHA-1542CP
.It Adaptec AHA-1640
.It Buslogic BT-54x
.It Tekram DC-300B
.It Tekram DC-320E
.El
This driver uses bounce buffers if the machine has more than 16
megabytes of memory.

@Move ncr.4 out of man4.i386/ncr.4 and update it from NetBSD.
Remove one of the tekram cards from man4.i386/aha.4 that is really
ncr-based and add cd.4, fpa.4, sd.4, st.4, uk.4 from NetBSD
(some originally from FreeBSD).

.Sh BUGS
The
.Nm
driver can not be used on systems with more than 16 megabytes of
memory.
.Pp
Due to the 24 bit addressing limitation of the ISA bus, The SCSI
adapter's onboard DMA controller is unable to access memory with
addresses greater than 16 megabytes.  
.Pp
This restriction can be fixed with "bounce buffers", buffers in low
memory which are used whenever data to be transfered to or from the
SCSI adapter is above the 16 megabyte threshold.  The data is copied
to the bounce buffer, then copied from the bounce buffer to its
destination.
