.Sh NAME
.Nm fdc
.Nd NEC765 compatible floppy disk driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "fdc0 at isa? port 0x3f0 irq 6 drq 2"
.Cd "fd* at fdc? drive ? flags Z"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm fdc
driver supports the standard AT floppy
disk controllers. These include standard IDE, MFM, RLL,
EIDE, ESDI and SCSI controllers with floppy attachment.
.Pp
The standard names of a floppy drive will take the form
.Nm /dev/fd{0,1,2,3}{,B,C,D,E,F,G,H}[abcdefghijklmnop] .
.Pp
The first component of this path is the unit number, permitting
a total of 4 floppy drives.
The next component is missing for the default geometry (it
would be A, but it is omitted for simplicity) and B-H for the
other 7 geometry types the floppy driver supports.
The last component of the path is the 16 partitions that a floppy
disk can support.
.Pp
The additional geometry types are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxx -compact
.It `B' 1.44MB
.It `C' 1.2MB
.It `D' 360KB/AT (360KB disk in a 1.2 MB drive)
.It `E' 360KB/PC (360KB drive)
.It `F' 720KB
.It `G' 720KB/x (720KB in a 1.2 MB drive)
.It `H' 360KB/x (360KB in a 720KB drive)
.El
.Pp
The default geometry is the format specified in the BIOS, and
is typically the largest supported format.
.Pp
Some floppy controllers do not respond correctly to probes, and
the configuration file
.Cm flags
field can be used to specify a particular drive type, overriding the
probed type.
If the 0x10 bit is on, the low order three bits of the
.Cm flags
field encode the drive type, as follows:
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxx -compact
.It 1 2.88MB
.It 2 1.44MB
.It 3 1.2MB
.It 4 720K
.It 5 360K
.It 6 1.2 MB japanese format
.El
.Pp
If the 0x20 bit is on, the drive will be attached even
if it was not found by the probe routine.
.Sh BUGS
The
.Nm fdc
driver can interfere with other controllers, namely some WD/SMC
network controllers fail to work when the probing mechanism
in the
.Nm fdc
driver probes for a missing second floppy drive.
In this case you should try recompiling the kernel
replacing the relevant line with
.Cd "fd0 at fdc? drive ?".

@- remove all trailing whitespace
     * except when it is escaped with a `\' at the end of the line
- fix remaining .Nm usage as well
- this is from a patch I received from kwesterback@@home.com, who has been
  working on some scripts for fixing formatting errors in mdoc'd man pages

Ok, so there could be a cost/benefit debate with this commit, but since I have
the patch we might as well commit it...
