.Dt AST 4 i386
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm ast
.Nd
multiplexing serial communications interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "ast0 at isa? port 0x1a0 irq 5"
.Cd "ast1 at isa? port 0x2a0 irq 6"
.Cd "com* at ast? slave ?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm ast
driver provides support for boards that multiplex together up to four
.Tn EIA
.Tn RS-232C
.Pf ( Tn CCITT
.Tn V.28 )
communications interfaces.  Apparently the original master of hardware
using this multiplexing protocol was AST.
.Pp
Each
.Nm
device is the master device for up to four
.Nm com
devices.  The kernel configuration specifies these
.Nm com
devices as slave devices of the
.Nm
device, as shown in the synopsis.  The slave ID given for each
.Nm com
device determines which bit in the interrupt multiplexing register is
tested to find interrupts for that device.
The
.Tn port
specification for the
.Nm
device is used to compute the base addresses for the
.Nm com
subdevices and the port for the interrupt multiplexing register.
.Pp
On a real AST card, the jumpers are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width xxxxx
.It SW1-1
Turn ON for irq 2.  Default is OFF.
.It SW1-2
Turn ON for irq 3.  Default is OFF.
.It SW1-3
Turn ON for irq 4.  Default is OFF.
.It SW2-1
Turn ON for irq 5.  This is ON for the first card, OFF otherwise.
.It SW2-2
Turn ON for irq 6.  This is ON for the second card, OFF otherwise.
.It SW2-3
Turn ON for irq 7.  Default is OFF.
.It SW3-1
`Compatible mode'.  The ast driver needs extended mode, so leave this OFF.
.It SW3-2
IO Address.  In extended mode, this should be OFF for the first card at
0x1a0-0x1a7 and ON for the second card at 0x2a0-0x2a7.
.It SW3-3
Interrupt sharing.  Default is OFF.
.It SW3-4
Reserved, must be OFF.

.Sh FILES

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver was written by Roland McGrath and placed into the public
domain.

@- remove all trailing whitespace
     * except when it is escaped with a `\' at the end of the line
- fix remaining .Nm usage as well
- this is from a patch I received from kwesterback@@home.com, who has been
  working on some scripts for fixing formatting errors in mdoc'd man pages

Ok, so there could be a cost/benefit debate with this commit, but since I have
the patch we might as well commit it...
