PS/2 auxiliary port mouse driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.\" XXX this is awful hackery to get it to work right... -- cgd
.\".Cd "pms0 at isa? port" \&"IO_KBD\&" irq 12
.Cd "pms0 at pckbd? irq 12"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This driver provides an interface to a PS/2 auxiliary port mice.  The driver
offers two modes of operation, both a raw and the old style translated
input stream.  The translating portion of the driver provides BusMouse
codes; in raw mode no translations are performed.
The
.Nm
driver provides three
.Em ioctls
for getting mouse status and changing modes.  They are defined in the
following include:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
#include <machine/mouse.h>
.Ed

The
.Dv MOUSEIOCREAD
.Em ioctl
is used to read the current mouse stats, and takes the
.Dv "struct mouseinfo"
as an argument to store the data in.

The
.Dv MOUSEIOCSRAW
.Em ioctl
puts the device into raw mode, if it is not already, and the
.Dv MOUSEIOCSCOOKED
.Em ioctl
puts it into translated (or cooked) mode.  If the mode of the
.Nm
device driver changes, all pending but not yet read input is flushed.
.Pp
In translated mode, the
.Nm
driver also supports
.Dq Intellimouse
devices, with the wheel acting as a third button.  The kernel must currently
be compiled with
.Pp
.Cd option INTELLIMOUSE
.Pp
specified in the config file, and the X server can be configured to use
the translated mode of the driver.  (The output of the translated mode is
.Em Busmouse
compatible.)  Otherwise, the mouse works as a normal, two button, PS/2
device.
.Pp
.Sh NOTES
The translated mode of this driver is being deprecated. The raw device
.Pa /dev/psm0
should be used in
.Pa /etc/XF86Config
with the
.Em PS/2
protocol, or one of its variants
.Pf ( Em IMPS/2
for MS Intellimouse,
.Em ThinkingMousePS/2
for Kensington Thinking Mouse).
