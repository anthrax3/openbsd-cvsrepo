.Sh NAME
.Nm xf86
.Nd XFree86 aperture driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "option APERTURE"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Pa /dev/xf86
driver provides access to the memory and I/O ports of a VGA board for
use by the XFree86 X servers
when running with a kernel security level > 0.
.Pp
The X servers require the use of this driver.
.Sh ACCESS CONTROL
Access to the
.Pa /dev/xf86
device is allowed when the sysctl variable
.Va machdep.allowaperture
>= 1.
This variable (which default value is 0)
can only be manipulated when the security level is <= 0, so it should be
set in
.Pa /etc/sysctl.conf .
The possible values for 
.Va machdep.allowaperture 
are:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It 0
the aperture driver is disabled.
Opening it returns
.Dv EPERM. 
.It 1
the aperture driver allows access to standard VGA framebuffer and
BIOS.
.It 2
the aperture driver allows access to the whole 1st megabyte of physical
memory, permitting use of the int10 emulation in XFree86 4.0.x.
Note that this can cause some security problems, since the process that
has access to the aperture driver can also access part of the kernel
memory.

.Xr XF86_Accel 1 ,
.Xr XF86_SVGA 1 ,
.Xr options 4 ,
.Xr sysctl.conf 5 ,
.Xr config 8 ,
.Xr sysctl 8
.Sh HISTORY
.Pa /dev/xf86
was introduced as a loadable kernel module for
.Nx 0.9 c
with XFree86 3.1.
It was integrated as an in-kernel device on
.Ox 2.3 .
It is required in order to allow access to I/O ports for all X servers since
.Ox 2.4 .
.Sh AUTHORS
The aperture driver was written by Matthieu Herrb.
.Sh BUGS
This driver allows access to all addresses above
.Va physmem .
It should be restricted to the actual address range of the video
memory.

@- remove all trailing whitespace
     * except when it is escaped with a `\' at the end of the line
- fix remaining .Nm usage as well
- this is from a patch I received from kwesterback@@home.com, who has been
  working on some scripts for fixing formatting errors in mdoc'd man pages

Ok, so there could be a cost/benefit debate with this commit, but since I have
the patch we might as well commit it...

Out of the approximately 1450 man pages, only about 90 of them were wrong.
Thanks to kwesterback@@home.com for coming up with a script and patch to repair
this. The patch also inserted a .Os macro in the few man pages that were
missing one.
