.Sh NAME
.Nm iy
.Nd Intel i82595 Ethernet driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "iy0 at isa? port 0x360 irq 7"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm iy
device driver supports the Ether-Express PRO/10 card, and might support
other ISA cards using the same chip.
.Pp
Other models of Intel network cards are supported by the
.Xr fxp 4
and
.Xr ie 4
drivers.
.Pp
Various models of these cards come with a different assortment of
connectors:
.Bl -tag -width 13n
.It AUI/DIX
Standard 15 pin connector
.It 10Base2
BNC, also known as thin-net
.It 10BaseT
UTP, also known as twisted pair
.El
.Pp
The default port to use is the port the card autodetects at
.Em ifconfig up
time.
To choose an alternative port, use the following flag combinations with
.Xr ifconfig 8
or in the appropriate
.Xr hostname.if 5
file.
.Bl -tag -width 13n
.It -link0 -link1
Use the autodetected port (default).
.It -link0 \ link1
Use the BNC port.
.It \ link0 -link1
Use the AUI port.
.It \ link0 \ link1
Use the UTP port.
.El
.Sh NOTES
The EtherExpress PRO card has no jumpers to set the address.
Intel supplies software to set the address of the card in software.
You have to hardwire this address in your kernel configuration file.

@Manpage cleaning police:
- more and better .Xr
- prefer "option FOO" rather than "options FOO", and put the option
  lines after the device definition lines in SYNOPSIS
- identify these manpages as section 4/i386, not section 4.
- long awaited update to intro(4/i386)
- npx(4/i386) was too NetBSD-ish - we only provide one math emulator
- random touches

- fix remaining .Nm usage as well
- this is from a patch I received from kwesterback@@home.com, who has been
  working on some scripts for fixing formatting errors in mdoc'd man pages

Ok, so there could be a cost/benefit debate with this commit, but since I have
the patch we might as well commit it...
