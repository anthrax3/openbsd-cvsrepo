.Sh NAME
.Nm rtfps
.Nd
multiplexing serial communications interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "rtfps0 at isa? port 0x1230 irq 10"
.Cd "com* at rtfps0 slave 0"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm rtfps
driver provides support for IBM RT PC boards that multiplex together up to four
.Rn EIA
.Tn RS-232C
.Pf ( Tn CCITT
.Tn V.28 )
or
.Tn RS-422A
communications interfaces.
.Pp
Each
.Nm
device is the master device for up to four
.Nm com
devices.  The kernel configuration specifies these
.Nm com
devices as slave devices of the
.Nm
device, as shown in the synopsis.
The
.Tn port
specification for the
.Nm
device is used to compute the base addresses for the
.Nm com
subdevices.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width Pa
.It Pa /dev/tty0?
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr com 4
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver was written by Charles Hannum, based on the
.Nm ast
driver.
.Sh BUGS
The
.Nm
driver is unlikely to work on non-EISA and non-PCI machines.  The ISA
bus only asserts 10 I/O address lines, and this is not enough.
.Pp
Even on EISA and PCI machines, some address conflicts have been observed.
On one machine, the second port always conflicted with something (though
it's not clear what) and caused strange results.  Disabling the second
port in the kernel config allowed the other three ports to function
correctly.

@- remove all trailing whitespace
     * except when it is escaped with a `\' at the end of the line
- fix remaining .Nm usage as well
- this is from a patch I received from kwesterback@@home.com, who has been
  working on some scripts for fixing formatting errors in mdoc'd man pages

Ok, so there could be a cost/benefit debate with this commit, but since I have
the patch we might as well commit it...
