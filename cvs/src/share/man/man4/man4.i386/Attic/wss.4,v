.Sh NAME
.Nm wss
.Nd Windows Sound System audio device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "wss0 at isa? port 0x530 irq 10 drq 0 flags 1"
.Cd "wss* at isapnp?"
.Cd "audio* at wss?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver supports Microsoft's Windows Sound System, MAD16 chip based
hardware and their clones.
The Windows Sound System is a half-duplex device.
.Pp
The base I/O port is set by a jumper on the board; valid choices are
0x530, 0x604, 0xE80, or 0xF40.
Both IRQ and DMA channels are software programmable.
The IRQ may be set to 5, 7, 9, 10, or 11, and
the DMA channel may be set to 0, 1, or 3.
.Pp
The configuration file must have bit 1 set in
.Cm flags
to enable the MAD16 support.
This is to avoid potential conflicts with other devices when probing the
MAD16 because it requires use of extra I/O ports not in the base port range.
Bit 2 in
.Cm flags
disables the joystick port on MAD16 hardware.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr audio 4 ,
.Xr intro 4 ,
.Xr isa 4 ,
.Xr isapnp 4
.Sh BUGS
The FM synthesizer is not supported.

@Manpage cleaning police:
- more and better .Xr
- prefer "option FOO" rather than "options FOO", and put the option
  lines after the device definition lines in SYNOPSIS
- identify these manpages as section 4/i386, not section 4.
- long awaited update to intro(4/i386)
- npx(4/i386) was too NetBSD-ish - we only provide one math emulator
- random touches

@- remove all trailing whitespace
     * except when it is escaped with a `\' at the end of the line
- fix remaining .Nm usage as well
- this is from a patch I received from kwesterback@@home.com, who has been
  working on some scripts for fixing formatting errors in mdoc'd man pages

Ok, so there could be a cost/benefit debate with this commit, but since I have
the patch we might as well commit it...
