.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm boca
.Nd
multiplexing serial communications interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
For 4-port BB1004 boards:
.Pp
.Cd "boca0 at isa? port 0x100 irq 5"
.Cd "com* at boca? slave ?"
.Pp
For 8-port BB1008 boards:
.Pp
.Cd "boca0 at isa? port 0x100 irq 5"
.Cd "com* at boca? slave ?"
.Pp
For 16-port BB2016 boards:
.Pp
.Cd "boca0 at isa? port 0x100 irq 5"
.Cd "boca1 at isa? port 0x140 irq 5"
.Cd "com* at boca? slave ?"
.Pp
(The BB2016 is functionally equivalent to two BB1008 boards,
and is configured as such.)
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm boca
driver provides support for BOCA Research BB1004, BB1008 and BB2016
boards that multiplex together up to four, eight or sixteen
.Tn EIA
.Tn RS-232C
.Pf ( Tn CCITT
.Tn V.28 )
communications interfaces.
.Pp
Each
.Nm
device is the master device for up to eight
.Nm com
devices.  The kernel configuration specifies these
.Nm com
devices as slave devices of the
.Nm
device, as shown in the synopsis.  The slave ID given for each
.Nm com
device determines which bit in the interrupt multiplexing register is
tested to find interrupts for that device.
The
.Tn port
specification for the
.Nm
device is used to compute the base addresses for the
.Nm com
subdevices and the port for the interrupt multiplexing register.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width Pa
.It Pa /dev/tty??
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr com 4
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver was written by Charles Hannum, based on the
.Nm ast
driver and source code from David Muir Sharnoff.  David wishes to
acknowledge the assistance of Jason Venner in determining how to use
the BOCA boards.

@- remove all trailing whitespace
     * except when it is escaped with a `\' at the end of the line
- fix remaining .Nm usage as well
- this is from a patch I received from kwesterback@@home.com, who has been
  working on some scripts for fixing formatting errors in mdoc'd man pages

Ok, so there could be a cost/benefit debate with this commit, but since I have
the patch we might as well commit it...
