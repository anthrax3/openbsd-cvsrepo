1.1
log
@auglx(4) is an audio(4) driver for the AC'97 audio codec found on
some AMD Geode LX systems with CS5536 companion chip.  It works
similar to auich(4) and auixp(4), but the hardware dependent parts
are quite different.

Tested with various PC-Engines ALIX boards (1B, 3C3) and a WebDT 186
board.
