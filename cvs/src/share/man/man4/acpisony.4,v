@Add support for Sony ACPI hotkeys via a new driver: acpisony(4).

Currently it only works for the suspend button and tries to do right for
the brightness events, but I haven't found a Sony laptop that like to do
right so far.

In the future I want to make the brightness keys work on all Sony's and
also add support for the zoom hotkeys and whatever other funky keys I can
find on those things.

Okay deraadt@@.
