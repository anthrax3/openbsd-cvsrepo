.Nd SGI Graphics Back End (GBE) frame buffer
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "gbe0 at mainbus0"
.Cd "wsdisplay* at gbe?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the on-board Graphics Back End (GBE) frame
buffer found in SGI
.Tn O2
machines.
Console support is provided by the
.Xr wscons 4
console framework.
.Pp
A special option
.Em nosog
can be passed from the ARCS firmware to the driver
via the
.Sy OSLoadOptions
environment variable to disable Sync-on-Green signal.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr intro 4 ,
.Xr mainbus 4 ,
.Xr wscons 4 ,
.Xr wsdisplay 4
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver first appeared in
.Ox 4.3 .
.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Nm
driver was written by
.An Joel Sing .
.Sh CAVEATS
Hardware initialization must currently be performed by the ARCS firmware.
The resolution configured by the firmware will be used, with a fixed
color depth of 8 bits.

@Add missing "wsdisplay* at gbe?". Also, list the hardware initialisation
requirements as a caveat rather than a bug.
