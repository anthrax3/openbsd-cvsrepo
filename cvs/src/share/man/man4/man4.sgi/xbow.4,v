.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm xbow
.Nd Octane and Origin family XIO bus
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "xbow0 at mainbus0"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the XIO bus found on SGI
.Sq ccNUMA
designs, such as the Octane
.Pq IP30
and Origin
.Pq IP27 and IP35
families, as well as related systems such as Onyx and Tezro.
.Pp
XIO components are called
.Sq widgets
and contain either I/O devices, processors, or memory.
.Pp
A XIO bus supports up to 16 widgets, but the existing designs only use
up to 8.
.Pp
Special
.Sq hub
widgets allow several XIO buses to be interconnected, expanding the
capacity of a given system, and allowing complex multi-node systems to be built.
.Pp
The widgets currently supported under
.Ox
are:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width 10n -compact -offset indent
.It Xr impact 4
SGI Impact (aka Mardigras) graphics
.It Xr odyssey 4
SGI VPro (aka Odyssey) graphics
.It Xr xbridge 4
XIO-PCI bridge
.It Xr xheart 4
Octane core system widget
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr intro 4 ,
.Xr mainbus 4
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver first appeared in
.Ox 4.4 .
.\" .Sh AUTHORS
.\" The
.\" .Nm
.\" driver was written by
.\" .An Miod Vallat .

log
@Neither .Pp nor unqualified text are allowed at the top level of .Bl;
instead, .It is required.  Thus, move .Pp and text before the .Bl,
and remove the .Pp altogether where it is not needed.

Syntax errors found by mandoc(1), also required to fix the mandoc build;
feedback and ok jmc@@, and sobrado@@ also supports the direction.
