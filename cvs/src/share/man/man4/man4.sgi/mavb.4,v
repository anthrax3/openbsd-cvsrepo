.Sh NAME
.Nm mavb
.Nd Moosehead A/V Board audio device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "mavb0 at macebus0"
.Cd "audio* at mavb?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the Moosehead A/V Board found on SGI
.Tn O2
machines.
.Pp
The Moosehead A/V Board uses an AD1843 codec that supports 8- and
16-bit audio sample recording and playback at rates from 5 to 54 kHz,
with 1 Hz resolution.
The
.Nm
driver also makes it possible to control the playback volume by using
the buttons on the front of the
.Tn O2 .
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr audio 4 ,
.Xr intro 4 ,
.Xr macebus 4
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver first appeared in
.Ox 3.7 .
.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Nm
driver was written by
.An Mark Kettenis .
.Sh CAVEATS
The analog mixer in the AD1843 codec does not provide a master volume
control.
Therefore, the
.Tn O2
volume buttons only control the output volume of the DAC.
.Sh BUGS
Currently only sample rates up to 48 kHz are supported.
The second DAC on the AD1843 codec sits idle.
