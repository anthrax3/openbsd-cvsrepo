.Sh NAME
.Nm light
.Nd SGI Light graphics
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "light* at gio?"
.Cd "wsdisplay* at light?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver supports the SGI
.Sq Light
series of graphics controllers, also known as
.Sq Entry
or
.Sq Starter
graphics, and designated as LG1 or LG2,
which may be found in Indigo and Crimson systems.
.Pp
These controllers have a fixed 1024x768 resolution with 8-bit colour depth.
Unlike most SGI offerings, both 13W3 and VGA video cables are supported.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr gio 4 ,
.Xr grtwo 4 ,
.Xr impact 4 ,
.Xr newport 4 ,
.Xr wscons 4 ,
.Xr wsdisplay 4
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver first appeared in
.Nx 5.0
and was ported to
.Ox 5.2 .
.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Nm
driver was written by
.An Stephen M. Rumble .
.Sh CAVEATS
Much is unknown about the REX chipset.
Therefore, the driver relies on the PROM to properly initialise the graphics.
.\" .Pp
.\" This driver will not run without modification on Crimson machines.

Therefore, the driver relies on the PROM to properly initialise the graphics,
and does not support color.
