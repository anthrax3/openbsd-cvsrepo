.Sh NAME
.Nm wdsc
.Nd WD33c93 SCSI controller
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "wdsc* at hpc?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the Western Digital WD33c93 and WD33c93B SCSI
controllers.
.Pp
In addition to sending the required SCSI commands to
target devices on the SCSI bus, the
.Nm
driver deals with DMA, device interrupts, sync/async negotiation,
and target disconnects/reconnects.
.Sh DEVICE FLAGS
.Bl -tag -width "Bits XX-XX" -compact
.It Bits 0-7
Disable disconnect/reselect for the corresponding target
.It Bits 8-15
Disable synchronous negotiation for target "[bit - 8]"
.It Bits 16-23
Disable tagged queuing for target "[bit - 16]"
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
device flags may be OR'd together to enable any combination of
the features listed above.
Tape devices should be allowed to disconnect for the SCSI bus to operate
acceptably.

@Work in progress support for the SGI Indigo, Indigo 2 and Indy systems
(IP20, IP22, IP24) in 64-bit mode, adapated from NetBSD. Currently limited
to headless operation, input and video drivers will get ported soon.

Should work on all R4000, R4440 and R5000 based systems. L2 cache on R5000SC
Indy not supported yet (coming soon), R4600 not supported yet either (coming
soon as well).

Tested to boot multiuser on: Indigo2 R4000SC, Indy R4000PC, Indy R4000SC,
Indy R5000SC, Indigo2 R4400SC. There are still glitches in the Ethernet driver
which are being looked at.

Expansion support is limited to the GIO E++ board; GIO boards with PCI-GIO
bridges not ported yet due to the lack of hardware, and this kind of driver
does not port blindly.

Most of this work comes from NetBSD, polishing and integration work, as well
as putting as many ``R4x00 in 64-bit mode'' erratas as necessary, by yours
truly.

More work is coming, as well as trying to get some easy way to boot install
kernels (as older PROM can only boot ECOFF binaries, which won't do for the
kernel).

.Sh HISTORY
Wayne Knowles ported the sgi incarnation of the
.Nm
driver from the amiga and atari ports.
It first appeared in
.Ox 3.6 .
.Sh BUGS
The current
.Nm
driver should be blown away and replaced with a machine independent
version as variants also exist in the amiga, atari, and mvme68k ports.
