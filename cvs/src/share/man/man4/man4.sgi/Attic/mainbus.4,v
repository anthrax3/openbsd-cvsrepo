.Sh NAME
.Nm mainbus
.Nd SGI main processor bus device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "mainbus0 at root"
.Cd "cpu* at mainbus0"
.Cd "macebus0 at mainbus0"
.Cd "gbe0 at mainbus0"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The

interface serves as an abstraction used by the autoconfiguration system to help
find and attach buses or devices connected to the main processor bus.
.Pp
In SGI O2 machines,
.Nm
corresponds to the CRIME (CPU, Rendering, Interconnect and Memory Engine) bus
which acts as a bridge between the CPU, main memory, MACE (Multimedia,
Audio and Communications Engine) bus, Video Image Compression Engine (VICE)
and Graphics Back End (GBE).
