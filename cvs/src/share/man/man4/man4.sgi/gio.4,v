.Dt GIO 4 sgi
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm gio
.Nd Graphics I/O GIO bus
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "gio0 at imc0"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
bus is a bus for connecting high-speed peripherals to the main memory and
CPU.
The devices themselves are typically (but not necessarily) connected to the
.Xr hpc 4
peripheral controller, and memory and CPU are accessed through the
.Xr imc 4
system controller.
The
.Nm
bus is found on the Indigo, Indy, Challenge S,
Challenge M, and Indigo2 machines and exists in three incarnations:
GIO32, GIO32-bis, and GIO64.
.Pp
The devices currently supported under
.Ox
are:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width 10n -compact -offset indent
.\" .It Xr giopci 4
.\" GIO-PCI bridge
.It Xr grtwo 4
SGI Express graphics
.It Xr hpc 4
SGI High performance Peripheral Controller
.It Xr impact 4
SGI Impact (aka Mardigras) graphics
.It Xr light 4
SGI Light graphics
.It Xr newport 4
SGI Newport graphics
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr imc 4 ,
.Xr intro 4
.Sh CAVEATS
Challenge S systems may use only one
.Nm
DMA-capable expansion card, despite having two slots.
Cards based on the
.Xr hpc 4
controller, such as the GIO32 SCSI and E++ Ethernet adapters, must be
placed in slot 1 (closest to the side of the case).
All other cards must be placed in slot 0 (adjacent to the memory banks).
.Pp
Indigo2 and Challenge M systems contain either three or four GIO64 connectors,
depending on the model.
However, in both cases only two electrically distinct slots are present.
Therefore, distinct expansion cards may not share physical connectors
associated with the same slot.
On the other hand, these apparently redundant slot connectors allow
multiple board assemblies to draw more power from the bus, and also
helps mix
.Nm
and EISA boards in the same chassis.
In all systems, the upper two GIO64 connectors are GIO slot 1, while
the lower connectors (either one or two of them) are GIO slot 0.

@Work in progress support for the SGI Indigo, Indigo 2 and Indy systems
(IP20, IP22, IP24) in 64-bit mode, adapated from NetBSD. Currently limited
to headless operation, input and video drivers will get ported soon.

Should work on all R4000, R4440 and R5000 based systems. L2 cache on R5000SC
Indy not supported yet (coming soon), R4600 not supported yet either (coming
soon as well).

Tested to boot multiuser on: Indigo2 R4000SC, Indy R4000PC, Indy R4000SC,
Indy R5000SC, Indigo2 R4400SC. There are still glitches in the Ethernet driver
which are being looked at.

Expansion support is limited to the GIO E++ board; GIO boards with PCI-GIO
bridges not ported yet due to the lack of hardware, and this kind of driver
does not port blindly.

Most of this work comes from NetBSD, polishing and integration work, as well
as putting as many ``R4x00 in 64-bit mode'' erratas as necessary, by yours
truly.

More work is coming, as well as trying to get some easy way to boot install
kernels (as older PROM can only boot ECOFF binaries, which won't do for the
kernel).
