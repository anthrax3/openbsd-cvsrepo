.Nd XIO-PCI bridge
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "xbridge* at xbow?"
.Cd "xbpci* at xbridge?"
.Cd "pci* at xbpci?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the XIO-PCI and XIO-PCI-X bridges commonly found
on Octane and Origin family systems.
.Pp
All these systems feature at least one
.Nm
device to which the on-board devices are connected.
.Pp
.Nm
devices support up to 8 different PCI devices, or two distinct
buses of 4 PCI-X devices.
Each PCI or PCI-X device is attached to a logical
.Nm xbpci
device.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr intro 4 ,
.Xr pci 4 ,
.Xr xbow 4
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver first appeared in
.Ox 4.4 .
Support for the PCI-X bridges was added in
.Ox 4.7 .

log
@Introduce a logical xbpci(4) device between xbridge and pci, since more than
one pci bus can attach to an xbridge (if PIC) and both being `bus 0' would
make dmesg confusing.
While there, seize the opportunity of this new dmesg line to display the
bus mode (PCI or PCIX) and speed.
