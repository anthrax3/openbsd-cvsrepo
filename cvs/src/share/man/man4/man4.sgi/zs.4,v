@It turns out that, when the IRIX header files mention CTR/DCD/DTR/RTS wiring
is inverted on Indigo, this just means that Indigo does not use the same
values as the later models. It does not mean that the Indigo is using wrong
values, which is how I first read this. In reality, Indigo systems use the
expected values of these signals being active low, while later designs
use active high signals.

So yes, some systems have inverted values - but the ones which need
compensating are not those I thought.

Change the logic to do TRT, but keep the device flags check, to be able to
force the other behaviour if the kernel guesses wrongly. Tested on Indigo,
Indy and Indigo 2.

.Sh NAME
.Nm zs ,
.Nm zskbd ,
.Nm zsms ,
.Nm zstty
.Nd Zilog 8530 (ZSCC) Serial Communications Controller
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "zs0    at hpc0"
.Cd "zs1    at hpc0"
.Cd "zskbd* at zs1 channel 0  " Pq "Indigo"
.Cd "zsms*  at zs1 channel 1  " Pq "Indigo"
.Cd "zstty* at zs0 channel ?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides TTY support for Zilog 8530 Dual UART chips.
On Indigo systems, one of the interfaces is hardwired for use by the
keyboard and mouse.
The
.Nm zskbd
devices connect keyboard devices to the generic keyboard driver
.Nm wskbd .
The
.Nm zsms
devices connect mice to the generic mouse driver
.Xr wsmouse 4 .
The remaining additional
.Nm zstty
interfaces provide RS-423
and RS-232 serial ports for general purpose use.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports all of the standard
.Xr tty 4
ioctl calls.
The status of the DTR, RTS, CTS, and DCD signals can be queried with
TIOCMGET command, but, due to limitations in the hardware,
only the DTR and RTS signals can be modified with TIOCMSET, TIOCMBIC,
and TIOCMBIS
.Xr ioctl 2
commands.
.Pp
Input and output for each line may set to any baud rate in the
range 50 to 38400 (and higher on some machines).
.Pp
On some systems, the hardware design causes the state of the CTS, DCD, DTR
and RTS lines to be inverted.
While the
.Nm zstty
driver attempts to correctly account for this quirk,
it can be forced to reverse its logic by setting
.Ar flags
to
.Ar 1
(either via
.Xr config 8
or
.Xr boot_config 8 ) .
Misconfiguration of these line settings usually leads to
.Xr getty 8
processes being unable to open the device or sleeping on
.Sq Dv ttyopn .

.El
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It zs0*: fifo overflow
.br
The on-chip
.Dq FIFO
has overflowed and incoming data has been lost.
This generally means the machine is not responding to
interrupts from the ZS chip fast enough, which can be
remedied only by using a lower baud rate.
.It zs0*: ring overflow
.br
The software input
.Qq ring
has overflowed.
This usually means input flow-control is not configured correctly
.Pq i.e. incorrect cable wiring .

@Work in progress support for the SGI Indigo, Indigo 2 and Indy systems
(IP20, IP22, IP24) in 64-bit mode, adapated from NetBSD. Currently limited
to headless operation, input and video drivers will get ported soon.

Should work on all R4000, R4440 and R5000 based systems. L2 cache on R5000SC
Indy not supported yet (coming soon), R4600 not supported yet either (coming
soon as well).

Tested to boot multiuser on: Indigo2 R4000SC, Indy R4000PC, Indy R4000SC,
Indy R5000SC, Indigo2 R4400SC. There are still glitches in the Ethernet driver
which are being looked at.

Expansion support is limited to the GIO E++ board; GIO boards with PCI-GIO
bridges not ported yet due to the lack of hardware, and this kind of driver
does not port blindly.

Most of this work comes from NetBSD, polishing and integration work, as well
as putting as many ``R4x00 in 64-bit mode'' erratas as necessary, by yours
truly.

More work is coming, as well as trying to get some easy way to boot install
kernels (as older PROM can only boot ECOFF binaries, which won't do for the
kernel).
