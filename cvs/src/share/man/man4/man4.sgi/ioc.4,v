.Sh NAME
.Nm ioc
.Nd IOC3 generic workstation I/O device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "ioc* at pci?"
.Cd "com0 at ioc? base 0x20178"
.Cd "com1 at ioc? base 0x20170"
.Cd "dsrtc0 at ioc?"
.Cd "iec* at ioc?"
.Cd "iockbc* at ioc?"
.Cd "onewire* at ioc?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for the various SGI IOC3 flavours on Octane and Origin
family systems.
.Pp
Depending on their particular configuration, the IOC3 boards may provide:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width 10n -offset ind -compact
.It Xr com 4
Two serial ports.
.It Xr dsrtc 4
Time-of-day chip.
.It Xr iec 4
10/100 Mbit/s Ethernet interface.
.It Xr iockbc 4
PS/2 keyboard and mouse interface.
.El
.Pp
In order to tell these configurations apart, all IOC3 boards, except those
on-board Origin family systems, contain a factory-setup
.Xr onewire 4
bus with
.Xr owserial 4
components identifying the IOC3 flavour, as well as
.Xr owmac 4
components storing the Ethernet address, for IOC3 devices with Ethernet
interfaces.

1.4
log
@Driver for the sgi IOC3 onboard Ethernet interface. Tested on Octane only so
far, and needs help to figure out its Ethernet address on IP35 systems.

Heavily derived from mec(4) written by Izumi Tsutsui and Christopher Sekiya,
although it required many changes to fit the IOC3 chip.
