.Nm hpc
.Nd SGI High performance Peripheral Controller
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "hpc0 at gio0 addr 0x1fb80000"
.Cd "hpc1 at gio0 addr 0x1fb00000"
.Cd "hpc2 at gio0 addr 0x1fb98000"
.\" .Cd "hpc3 at gio0 addr 0x1fb90000"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
interfaces the peripherals connected to it to the
.Xr gio 4
bus.
.Nm
is found on the Indigo, Indy, Challenge S, Challenge M,
and Indigo2 machines.
.Pp
There are three different numerical revisions of the
.Nm
controller.
Revisions 1 and 1.5 exist on Indigo machines,
as well as GIO32bis expansion cards such as the E++ SEEQ-based
Ethernet adapter.
Revision 1.5 supports bi-endian operation.
Revision 3 exists on Indy, Challenge S, Indigo2, and Challenge M systems.
It is possible to have an on-board HPC3 as well as HPC1.5-based
GIO32bis adapters in the Indy and Challenge S systems.
Additionally, the Challenge S may have a secondary HPC3 if the IOPLUS
(a.k.a. ''mezzanine'') board is installed.

log
@Default DMA-reachable address constraints to the whole address space, and
narrow these in the various ipXX_machdep.c. On IP22-like systems, narrow
them to 28 bit physical addresses, but unpessimize this by extending this
to 32 bit after autoconf, if no 28-bit limited hpc(4) device has been found.
Since physical memory on these systems start at 128MB, this means that Indigo
systems with more than 128MB memory will behave correctly (and so will Indy
systems with E++ boards and more than 128MB memory).

.Sh BUGS
.Nm
revisions 1 and 1.5 support DMA buffer pointers of only 28 bits
and may therefore only address 256 megabytes of memory.
The R4k Indigo and Indy are the only systems that support sufficient
memory to illustrate this drawback.
A software workaround is not currently implemented.
Revision 3, with 32-bit pointers, does not have this limitation.

1.4
log
@Work in progress support for the SGI Indigo, Indigo 2 and Indy systems
(IP20, IP22, IP24) in 64-bit mode, adapated from NetBSD. Currently limited
to headless operation, input and video drivers will get ported soon.

Should work on all R4000, R4440 and R5000 based systems. L2 cache on R5000SC
Indy not supported yet (coming soon), R4600 not supported yet either (coming
soon as well).

Tested to boot multiuser on: Indigo2 R4000SC, Indy R4000PC, Indy R4000SC,
Indy R5000SC, Indigo2 R4400SC. There are still glitches in the Ethernet driver
which are being looked at.

Expansion support is limited to the GIO E++ board; GIO boards with PCI-GIO
bridges not ported yet due to the lack of hardware, and this kind of driver
does not port blindly.

Most of this work comes from NetBSD, polishing and integration work, as well
as putting as many ``R4x00 in 64-bit mode'' erratas as necessary, by yours
truly.

More work is coming, as well as trying to get some easy way to boot install
kernels (as older PROM can only boot ECOFF binaries, which won't do for the
kernel).
