.Sh NAME
.Nm ums
.Nd USB HID mouse, touchscreen and digitiser devices
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "ums*     at uhidev?"
.Cd "wsmouse* at ums? mux 0"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for USB HID mice, touchscreens and digitisers.
Access to these devices is through the
.Xr wscons 4
driver.
.Pp
If the touchscreen sensor is poorly aligned, then
.Xr xtsscale 1
should be used to provide calibration results to the
.Nm
driver.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr xtsscale 1 ,
.Xr uhidev 4 ,
.Xr usb 4 ,
.Xr wsmouse 4
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver
first appeared in
.Ox 2.8 .
.Sh AUTHORS
.An -nosplit
HID touchscreen and digitiser support was written by
.An Robert Nagy
and
.An Matthieu Herrb
then later merged into the generic
.Nm
driver by
.An Edd Barrett .
.Sh CAVEATS
Touchscreen and digitiser pressure sensitivity is not yet implemented.

log
@Merge uhts(1) into ums(1). The code is amost the same, so no need to duplicate.

A part of ongoing work to improve touchscreen/digitiser support.

A diff will follow shortly to remove uhts(1).

log
@First pass at removing clauses 3 and 4 from NetBSD licenses.

Not sure what's more surprising: how long it took for NetBSD to
catch up to the rest of the BSDs (including UCB), or the amount of
code that NetBSD has claimed for itself without attributing to the
actual authors.
