Parallel port driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.\" XXX this is awful hackery to get it to work right... -- cgd
.Cd "lpt0 at isa? port" \&"IO_LPT1\&" irq 7
.Cd "lpt1 at isa? port" \&"IO_LPT2\&"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This driver provides access to parallel ports.
.Pp
The highest bit in the minor (bit 7, or add 128) number selects
whether to do polling or wait for interrupts.  If no IRQ is specified
in the kernel configuration, only the polling device may be used.
.Pp
The next lower bit (bit 6, or add 64) indicates the driver should
avoid initializing the printer.
.P.
The next lower bit (bit 5, or add 32) requests that the driver do
automatic LF generation when printing CR's.
