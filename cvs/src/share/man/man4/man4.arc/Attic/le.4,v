.Dt LE 4 alpha
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm le
.Nd Alpha on-board or PCI LANCE ethernet interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "le* at  tc? slot ? offset ? " Pq "TurboChannel Alphas"
.Cd "le* at pci? dev ? function ?" Pq "PCI LANCE Ethernet (untested)"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
interface provides access to the Ethernet network via the
.Tn AMD
.Tn LANCE
Ethernet chip set.
.Pp
Each of the host's network addresses
is specified at boot time with an
.Dv SIOCSIFADDR
.Xr ioctl .
The
.Nm
interface employs the address resolution protocol described in
.Xr arp 4
to dynamically map between Internet and Ethernet addresses on the local
network.
.Sh BUGS
The PCI form of the Lance driver is untested.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr arp 4 ,
.Xr inet 4 ,
.Xr intro 4

@- remove all trailing whitespace
     * except when it is escaped with a `\' at the end of the line
- fix remaining .Nm usage as well
- this is from a patch I received from kwesterback@@home.com, who has been
  working on some scripts for fixing formatting errors in mdoc'd man pages

Ok, so there could be a cost/benefit debate with this commit, but since I have
the patch we might as well commit it...
