.Nm ses
.Nd SCSI Enclosure Services
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "ses* at scsibus?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for monitoring the various environmental sensors
present in SCSI enclosures using the SCSI Enclosure Services command set.
The hardware monitoring is accessed via the
.Va hw.sensors
.Xr sysctl 8
variable.
.Pp
SCSI devices have a fairly high level interface to the system and talk to it
via a SCSI host adapter (e.g.\&
.Xr ahc 4 ) .
A SCSI adapter must also be separately configured into the system before a
SCSI enclosure can be configured.
.Pp
When the SCSI adapter is probed during boot, the SCSI bus is scanned for
devices.
Any SCSI-2 devices of type
.Dq Enclosure service
or SCSI-3 devices of type
.Dq Processor
will be attached to the
.Nm
driver.
.Pp
SES compliant devices can provide an arbitrary set of sensors which may
include the following types:
.Bl -column "Sensor" "Units" "Typical" -offset indent
.It Sy "Sensor" Ta Sy "Units" Ta Sy "Typical Use"
.It Li "temp" Ta "uK" Ta "temperature"
.It Li "fan" Ta "RPM" Ta "fan"
.It Li "psu" Ta "On/Off" Ta "power supply"
.It Li "doorlock" Ta "On/Off" Ta "door lock"
.It Li "alarm" Ta "On/Off" Ta "enclosure alarm"
.El
.Pp
Sensor data is updated every 10 seconds.
.Pp
An enclosure may provide environmental information using an alternative
command set to the SCSI Enclosure Services used by this driver.
Enclosures using the SCSI Accessed Fault-Tolerant Enclosure command set
may be monitored by the
.Xr safte 4
driver.

state), temperature, device slots, and so on.

- never mention intro(4) on non-physical devices (i.e. protocols), always
mention it for physical devices
- random text style and quoting fixes
- drivers ported from FreeBSD did mention rc.conf instead of hostname.if as
the place to put mediaopt
