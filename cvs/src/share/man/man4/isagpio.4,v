.Sh NAME
.Nm isagpio
.Nd ISA I/O mapped as GPIO
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "isagpio0 at isa? port 0x78"
.Cd "isagpio1 at isa? port 0x80"
.Cd "gpio* at isagpio?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver allows access to the 8-bit ISA I/O space through the
.Xr gpio 4
framework, thus making use of the simple GPIO devices connected directly
to the ISA bus.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr gpio 4 ,
.Xr intro 4 ,
.Xr isa 4 ,
.Xr gpioctl 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver first appeared in
.Ox 4.0 .
.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Nm
driver was written by
.An Oleg Safiullin Aq Mt form@@pdp-11.org.ru .
