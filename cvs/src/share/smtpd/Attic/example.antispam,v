# example antispam file. Modify to suit your needs.
#
# This file goes in /var/spool/smtpd/etc/smtpd_check_rules
# once you have modified it appropriately for your site.
#
# This example does two things: 1, it prevents unauthorized relaying, 
# 2), it blocks incoming SPAM from the major SPAM domains. To keep
# an eye on the current worst offenders, check out http://spam.abuse.net/
#
# If you really dislike SPAM, you can try compiling with NOTO_DELAY
# set to some (relatively small) value, and changing the "noto" rules
# in this file to "noto_delay" rules. 
# 
# This file assumes that our domains are "mydomain.com" and "otherdomain.com".
# assumes our dns servers are "dns1.mydomain.com", etc. etc. 
# you will need to edit this file for your own use. 

# First, allow us to relay outgoing mail from our hosts.
allow:*mydomain.com *otherdomain.com:ALL:ALL

# don't allow people to use %hack to relay off of me.
noto:ALL:ALL:*%*@@*:551 Sorry %H (%I), I don't allow unauthorized relaying. You can't use me to send mail from %F to %T.
noto:ALL:ALL:*!*@@*:551 Sorry %H (%I), I don't allow unauthorized relaying. You can't use me to send mail from %F to %T.

# First, the exceptions.
# "I'll have your spam dear, I love it!"
#
# The people below have requested that all mail be let through to them
# with no filtering for SPAM, and we accommodate them here.

# Block any connections from a host or connecting address who uses a

# as a nameserver for, or a connection with a FROM: address that uses 
# a nameserver or MX from a them. As an example, we use the old cyberpromo
# netblocks below. You should not use a rule such as below unless you are

# dump things with a bogus rhs to a FROM: addresses. usually spammers
# This drops any message where the FROM: address is given as 
# anything@@bogus, where "bogus" is
# 1) not resolvable as a hostname.
# 2) not resolvable as an NS or MX record
# In other words, this basically tosses anything that gives a FROM address
# in the smtp dialogue that you would probably have no hope of replying
# to via smtp. 

# You can may wish to use a 450 (which invites the sender to retry)
# rather than a 550 that won't in order not to lose real mail that has
# no resolution due to temporary DNS problems. However be warned that
# if you do lots of SPAM may get retried a lot. I've had varying
# success with using 450 depending on how busy the site is.
noto:ALL:NS=UNKNOWN:ALL:550 Your FROM address (%F) doesn't seem to resolve to a host, domain, or MX record. Please mail to %T from a valid e-mail address.

# otherwise, allow untrusted connections with mail to anywhere we MX
# this should do it nicely:
allow:ALL:ALL:NS=dns*.mydomain.com
# An alternative is to allow by domain, below.

##############################################
# don't relay mail to other places from other connections, so
# we don't get used as a spam relay
