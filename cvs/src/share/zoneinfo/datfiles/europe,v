# Unfortunately this book contains many errors and cites no sources.
#
# Many years ago Gwillim Law wrote that a good source
# for time zone data was the International Air Transport
# Association's Standard Schedules Information Manual (IATA SSIM),
# published semiannually.  Law sent in several helpful summaries
# of the IATA's data after 1990.  Except where otherwise noted,
# IATA SSIM is the source for entries after 1990.
#
# A reliable and entertaining source about time zones is
# Derek Howse, Greenwich time and longitude, Philip Wilson Publishers (1997).
#
# Except where otherwise noted, Shanks & Pottenger is the source for
# entries through 1991, and IATA SSIM is the source for entries afterwards.

# Britain (United Kingdom) and Ireland (Eire)

# From Peter Ilieve (1994-07-06):
#
# On 17 Jan 1994 the Independent, a UK quality newspaper, had a piece about
# historical vistas along the Thames in west London. There was a photo
# and a sketch map showing some of the sightlines involved. One paragraph
# of the text said:
#
# 'An old stone obelisk marking a forgotten terrestrial meridian stands
# beside the river at Kew. In the 18th century, before time and longitude
# was standardised by the Royal Observatory in Greenwich, scholars observed
# this stone and the movement of stars from Kew Observatory nearby. They
# made their calculations and set the time for the Horse Guards and Parliament,
# but now the stone is obscured by scrubwood and can only be seen by walking
# along the towpath within a few yards of it.'
#
# I have a one inch to one mile map of London and my estimate of the stone's
# position is 51 degrees 28' 30" N, 0 degrees 18' 45" W. The longitude should
# be within about +-2". The Ordnance Survey grid reference is TQ172761.
#
# [This yields GMTOFF = -0:01:15 for London LMT in the 18th century.]

# From Paul Eggert (1993-11-18):
#
# Howse writes that Britain was the first country to use standard time.
# The railways cared most about the inconsistencies of local mean time,
# and it was they who forced a uniform time on the country.
# The original idea was credited to Dr. William Hyde Wollaston (1766-1828)
# and was popularized by Abraham Follett Osler (1808-1903).
# The first railway to adopt London time was the Great Western Railway
# in November 1840; other railways followed suit, and by 1847 most
# (though not all) railways used London time.  On 1847-09-22 the
# Railway Clearing House, an industry standards body, recommended that GMT be
# adopted at all stations as soon as the General Post Office permitted it.
# The transition occurred on 12-01 for the L&NW, the Caledonian,
# and presumably other railways; the January 1848 Bradshaw's lists many
# railways as using GMT.  By 1855 the vast majority of public
# clocks in Britain were set to GMT (though some, like the great clock
# on Tom Tower at Christ Church, Oxford, were fitted with two minute hands,
# one for local time and one for GMT).  The last major holdout was the legal
# system, which stubbornly stuck to local time for many years, leading
# to oddities like polls opening at 08:13 and closing at 16:13.
# The legal system finally switched to GMT when the Statutes (Definition
# of Time) Act took effect; it received the Royal Assent on 1880-08-02.
#
# In the tables below, we condense this complicated story into a single
# transition date for London, namely 1847-12-01.  We don't know as much
# about Dublin, so we use 1880-08-02, the legal transition time.

# From Paul Eggert (2014-07-19):
# The ancients had no need for daylight saving, as they kept time
# informally or via hours whose length depended on the time of year.
# Daylight saving time in its modern sense was invented by the
# New Zealand entomologist George Vernon Hudson (1867-1946),
# whose day job as a postal clerk led him to value
# after-hours daylight in which to pursue his research.
# In 1895 he presented a paper to the Wellington Philosophical Society
# that proposed a two-hour daylight-saving shift.  See:
# Hudson GV. On seasonal time-adjustment in countries south of lat. 30 deg.
# Transactions and Proceedings of the New Zealand Institute. 1895;28:734
# http://rsnz.natlib.govt.nz/volume/rsnz_28/rsnz_28_00_006110.html
# Although some interest was expressed in New Zealand, his proposal
# did not find its way into law and eventually it was almost forgotten.
#
# In England, DST was independently reinvented by William Willett (1857-1915),
# a London builder and member of the Royal Astronomical Society
# who circulated a pamphlet "The Waste of Daylight" (1907)
# that proposed advancing clocks 20 minutes on each of four Sundays in April,
# and retarding them by the same amount on four Sundays in September.
# A bill was drafted in 1909 and introduced in Parliament several times,
# but it met with ridicule and opposition, especially from farming interests.
# Later editions of the pamphlet proposed one-hour summer time, and
# it was eventually adopted as a wartime measure in 1916.
# See: Summer Time Arrives Early, The Times (2000-05-18).
# A monument to Willett was unveiled on 1927-05-21, in an open space in
# a 45-acre wood near Chislehurst, Kent that was purchased by popular
# subscription and open to the public.  On the south face of the monolith,
# designed by G. W. Miller, is the William Willett Memorial Sundial,
# which is permanently set to Summer Time.

# From Winston Churchill (1934-04-28):
# It is one of the paradoxes of history that we should owe the boon of
# summer time, which gives every year to the people of this country
# between 160 and 170 hours more daylight leisure, to a war which
# plunged Europe into darkness for four years, and shook the
# foundations of civilization throughout the world.

#	republished in Finest Hour (Spring 2002) 1(114):26
#	http://www.winstonchurchill.org/images/finesthour/Vol.01%20No.114.pdf

# From Paul Eggert (2015-08-08):
# The OED Supplement says that the English originally said "Daylight Saving"
# when they were debating the adoption of DST in 1908; but by 1916 this
# term appears only in quotes taken from DST's opponents, whereas the
# proponents (who eventually won the argument) are quoted as using "Summer".
# The term "Summer Time" was introduced by Herbert Samuel, Home Secretary; see:
# Viscount Samuel. Leisure in a Democracy. Cambridge University Press
# ISBN 978-1-107-49471-8 (1949, reissued 2015), p 8.

# From Arthur David Olson (1989-01-19):
# A source at the British Information Office in New York avers that it's
# known as "British" Summer Time in all parts of the United Kingdom.

# Date: 4 Jan 89 08:57:25 GMT (Wed)
# From: Jonathan Leffler
# [British Summer Time] is fixed annually by Act of Parliament.
# If you can predict what Parliament will do, you should be in
# politics making a fortune, not computing.

# From Chris Carrier (1996-06-14):
# I remember reading in various wartime issues of the London Times the
# acronym BDST for British Double Summer Time.  Look for the published
# time of sunrise and sunset in The Times, when BDST was in effect, and
# if you find a zone reference it will say, "All times B.D.S.T."

# From Joseph S. Myers (1999-09-02):
# ... some military cables (WO 219/4100 - this is a copy from the
# main SHAEF archives held in the US National Archives, SHAEF/5252/8/516)
# agree that the usage is BDST (this appears in a message dated 17 Feb 1945).

# From Joseph S. Myers (2000-10-03):
# On 18th April 1941, Sir Stephen Tallents of the BBC wrote to Sir
# Alexander Maxwell of the Home Office asking whether there was any
# official designation; the reply of the 21st was that there wasn't
# but he couldn't think of anything better than the "Double British
# Summer Time" that the BBC had been using informally.
# http://www.polyomino.org.uk/british-time/bbc-19410418.png
# http://www.polyomino.org.uk/british-time/ho-19410421.png

# From Sir Alexander Maxwell in the above-mentioned letter (1941-04-21):
# [N]o official designation has as far as I know been adopted for the time
# which is to be introduced in May....
# I cannot think of anything better than "Double British Summer Time"
# which could not be said to run counter to any official description.

# From Paul Eggert (2000-10-02):
# Howse writes (p 157) 'DBST' too, but 'BDST' seems to have been common
# and follows the more usual convention of putting the location name first,
# so we use 'BDST'.

# Peter Ilieve (1998-04-19) described at length
# the history of summer time legislation in the United Kingdom.
# Since 1998 Joseph S. Myers has been updating
# and extending this list, which can be found in
# http://www.polyomino.org.uk/british-time/

# From Joseph S. Myers (1998-01-06):
#
# The legal time in the UK outside of summer time is definitely GMT, not UTC;
# see Lord Tanlaw's speech
# http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199798/ldhansrd/vo970611/text/70611-10.htm#70611-10_head0
# (Lords Hansard 11 June 1997 columns 964 to 976).

# From Paul Eggert (2006-03-22):
#
# For lack of other data, follow Shanks & Pottenger for Eire in 1940-1948.
#
# Given Ilieve and Myers's data, the following claims by Shanks & Pottenger
# are incorrect:
#     * Wales did not switch from GMT to daylight saving time until
#	1921 Apr 3, when they began to conform with the rest of Great Britain.
# Actually, Wales was identical after 1880.
#     * Eire had two transitions on 1916 Oct 1.
# It actually just had one transition.
#     * Northern Ireland used single daylight saving time throughout WW II.
# Actually, it conformed to Britain.
#     * GB-Eire changed standard time to 1 hour ahead of GMT on 1968-02-18.
# Actually, that date saw the usual switch to summer time.
# Standard time was not changed until 1968-10-27 (the clocks didn't change).
#
# Here is another incorrect claim by Shanks & Pottenger:
#     * Jersey, Guernsey, and the Isle of Man did not switch from GMT
#	to daylight saving time until 1921 Apr 3, when they began to
#	conform with Great Britain.
# S.R.&O. 1916, No. 382 and HO 45/10811/312364 (quoted above) say otherwise.
#
# The following claim by Shanks & Pottenger is possible though doubtful;
# we'll ignore it for now.
#     * Dublin's 1971-10-31 switch was at 02:00, even though London's was 03:00.
#
#
# Whitman says Dublin Mean Time was -0:25:21, which is more precise than
# Shanks & Pottenger.
# Perhaps this was Dunsink Observatory Time, as Dunsink Observatory
# (8 km NW of Dublin's center) seemingly was to Dublin as Greenwich was
# to London.  For example:
#
#   "Timeball on the ballast office is down.  Dunsink time."
#   -- James Joyce, Ulysses

# "Countess Markievicz ... claimed that the [1916] abolition of Dublin Mean Time
# was among various actions undertaken by the 'English' government that
# would 'put the whole country into the SF (Sinn Féin) camp'.  She claimed
# Irish 'public feeling (was) outraged by forcing of English time on us'."
# -- Parsons M. Dublin lost its time zone - and 25 minutes - after 1916 Rising.
# Irish Times 2014-10-27.

# From Joseph S. Myers (2005-01-26):
# Irish laws are available online at <http://www.irishstatutebook.ie>.
# These include various relating to legal time, for example:

#
# [These are all relative to the root, e.g., the first is
# <http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/ZZA13Y1923.html>.]
#
# (These are those I found, but there could be more.  In any case these
# should allow various updates to the comments in the europe file to cover
# the laws applicable in Ireland.)
#
# (Note that the time in the Republic of Ireland since 1968 has been defined
# in terms of standard time being GMT+1 with a period of winter time when it
# is GMT, rather than standard time being GMT with a period of summer time
# being GMT+1.)

# From Paul Eggert (1999-03-28):
# Clive Feather (<news:859845706.26043.0@@office.demon.net>, 1997-03-31)
# reports that Folkestone (Cheriton) Shuttle Terminal uses Concession Time
# (CT), equivalent to French civil time.
# Julian Hill (<news:36118128.5A14@@virgin.net>, 1998-09-30) reports that
# trains between Dollands Moor (the freight facility next door)
# and Frethun run in CT.
# My admittedly uninformed guess is that the terminal has two authorities,
# the French concession operators and the British civil authorities,
# and that the time depends on who you're talking to.
# If, say, the British police were called to the station for some reason,
# I would expect the official police report to use GMT/BST and not CET/CEST.
# This is a borderline case, but for now let's stick to GMT/BST.

# From an anonymous contributor (1996-06-02):
# The law governing time in Ireland is under Statutory Instrument SI 395/94,
# which gives force to European Union 7th Council Directive No. 94/21/EC.
# Under this directive, the Minister for Justice in Ireland makes appropriate
# regulations. I spoke this morning with the Secretary of the Department of
# Justice (tel +353 1 678 9711) who confirmed to me that the correct name is
# "Irish Summer Time", abbreviated to "IST".

# From Jesper Nørgaard Welen (2008-07-13):
#
# I found what is probably a typo of 2:00 which should perhaps be 2:00s
# in the C-Eur rule from tz database version 2008d (this part was
# corrected in version 2008d). The circumstantial evidence is simply the
# tz database itself, as seen below:

# It seems that Paris, Monaco, Rule France, Rule Belgium all agree on
# 2:00 standard time, e.g. 3:00 local time.  However there are no
# countries that use C-Eur rules in September 1945, so the only items

# Wikipedia and other sources refer to the Act of the Council of
# Ministers of the USSR from 1988-01-04 No. 5 and the Act of the
# Council of Ministers of the USSR from 1989-03-14 No. 227.
#
# I did not find full texts of these acts.  For the 1989 one we have
# title at http://base.garant.ru/70754136/ :
# "About change in calculation of time on the territories of
# Lithuanian SSR, Latvian SSR and Estonian SSR, Astrakhan,
# Kaliningrad, Kirov, Kuybyshev, Ulyanovsk and Uralsk oblasts".
# And http://astrozet.net/files/Zones/DOC/RU/1980-925.txt appears to
# contain quotes from both acts: Since last Sunday of March 1988 rules
# of the second time belt are installed in Volgograd and Saratov
# oblasts.  Since last Sunday of March 1989:
# a) Lithuanian SSR, Latvian SSR, Estonian SSR, Kaliningrad oblast:
# second time belt rules without extra hour (Moscow-1);
# b) Astrakhan, Kirov, Kuybyshev, Ulyanovsk oblasts: second time belt
# rules (Moscow time)
# c) Uralsk oblast: third time belt rules (Moscow+1).

# From Stepan Golosunov (2016-03-27):
# Unamended version of the act of the
# Government of the Russian Federation No. 23 from 08.01.1992
# http://pravo.gov.ru/proxy/ips/?docbody=&nd=102014034&rdk=0
# says that every year clocks were to be moved forward on last Sunday
# of March at 2 hours and moved backwards on last Sunday of September
# at 3 hours.  It was amended in 1996 to replace September with October.

# From Alexander Krivenyshev (2011-06-14):
# According to Kremlin press service, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev
# signed a federal law "On calculation of time" on June 9, 2011.
# According to the law Russia is abolishing daylight saving time.

# Previous editions of this database used abbreviations like MET DST

# From Markus Kuhn (1996-07-12):

#	Mitteleuropäische Sommerzeit (MESZ)  = UTC+02:00
#

# Use Europe/Prague also for Slovakia.

# From Jesper Nørgaard Welen (2005-04-26):
# http://www.hum.aau.dk/~poe/tid/tine/DanskTid.htm says that the law
# [introducing standard time] was in effect from 1894-01-01....
# The page http://www.retsinfo.dk/_GETDOCI_/ACCN/A18930008330-REGL
# confirms this, and states that the law was put forth 1893-03-29.
#
# The EU treaty with effect from 1973:
# http://www.retsinfo.dk/_GETDOCI_/ACCN/A19722110030-REGL
#
# This provoked a new law from 1974 to make possible summer time changes
# in subsequent decrees with the law
# http://www.retsinfo.dk/_GETDOCI_/ACCN/A19740022330-REGL
#
# It seems however that no decree was set forward until 1980.  I have
# not found any decree, but in another related law, the effecting DST
# changes are stated explicitly to be from 1980-04-06 at 02:00 to
# 1980-09-28 at 02:00.  If this is true, this differs slightly from
# the EU rule in that DST runs to 02:00, not 03:00.  We don't know
# when Denmark began using the EU rule correctly, but we have only
# confirmation of the 1980-time, so I presume it was correct in 1981:
# The law is about the management of the extra hour, concerning
# working hours reported and effect on obligatory-rest rules (which
# was suspended on that night):
# http://www.retsinfo.dk/_GETDOCI_/ACCN/C19801120554-REGL

# From Jesper Nørgaard Welen (2005-06-11):
# The Herning Folkeblad (1980-09-26) reported that the night between
# Saturday and Sunday the clock is set back from three to two.

# From Paul Eggert (2005-06-11):
# Hence the "02:00" of the 1980 law refers to standard time, not
# wall-clock time, and so the EU rules were in effect in 1980.

# From Paul Eggert (2004-10-31):
# During World War II, Germany maintained secret manned weather stations in
# East Greenland and Franz Josef Land, but we don't know their time zones.
# My source for this is Wilhelm Dege's book mentioned under Svalbard.
#
# From Paul Eggert (2006-03-22):
# Greenland joined the EU as part of Denmark, obtained home rule on 1979-05-01,
# and left the EU on 1985-02-01.  It therefore should have been using EU
# rules at least through 1984.  Shanks & Pottenger say Scoresbysund and Godthåb
# used C-Eur rules after 1980, but IATA SSIM (1991/1996) says they use EU
# rules since at least 1991.  Assume EU rules since 1980.

# From Gwillim Law (2001-06-06), citing
# <http://www.statkart.no/efs/efshefter/2001/efs5-2001.pdf> (2001-03-15),
# and with translations corrected by Steffen Thorsen:
#
# Greenland has four local times, and the relation to UTC
# is according to the following time line:
#
# The military zone near Thule	UTC-4
# Standard Greenland time	UTC-3
# Scoresbysund			UTC-1
# Danmarkshavn			UTC
#
# In the military area near Thule and in Danmarkshavn DST will not be
# introduced.

# From Rives McDow (2001-11-01):
#
# I correspond regularly with the Dansk Polarcenter, and wrote them at
# the time to clarify the situation in Thule.  Unfortunately, I have
# not heard back from them regarding my recent letter.  [But I have
# info from earlier correspondence.]
#
# According to the center, a very small local time zone around Thule
# Air Base keeps the time according to UTC-4, implementing daylight
# savings using North America rules, changing the time at 02:00 local time....
#
# The east coast of Greenland north of the community of Scoresbysund
# uses UTC in the same way as in Iceland, year round, with no dst.
# There are just a few stations on this coast, including the
# Danmarkshavn ICAO weather station mentioned in your September 29th
# email.  The other stations are two sledge patrol stations in
# Mestersvig and Daneborg, the air force base at Station Nord, and the
# DPC research station at Zackenberg.
#
# Scoresbysund and two small villages nearby keep time UTC-1 and use
# the same daylight savings time period as in West Greenland (Godthåb).
#
# The rest of Greenland, including Godthåb (this area, although it
# includes central Greenland, is known as west Greenland), keeps time
# UTC-3, with daylight savings methods according to European rules.
#
# It is common procedure to use UTC 0 in the wilderness of East and
# North Greenland, because it is mainly Icelandic aircraft operators
# maintaining traffic in these areas.  However, the official status of
# this area is that it sticks with Godthåb time.  This area might be
# considered a dual time zone in some respects because of this.

# From Rives McDow (2001-11-19):
# I heard back from someone stationed at Thule; the time change took place
# there at 2:00 AM.

# From Paul Eggert (2006-03-22):
# From 1997 on the CIA map shows Danmarkshavn on GMT;
# the 1995 map as like Godthåb.
# For lack of better info, assume they were like Godthåb before 1996.
# startkart.no says Thule does not observe DST, but this is clearly an error,
# so go with Shanks & Pottenger for Thule transitions until this year.
# For 2007 on assume Thule will stay in sync with US DST rules.

# From J William Piggott (2016-02-20):
# "Greenland north of the community of Scoresbysund" is officially named
# "National Park" by Executive Order:
# http://naalakkersuisut.gl/~/media/Nanoq/Files/Attached%20Files/Engelske-tekster/Legislation/Executive%20Order%20National%20Park.rtf
# It is their only National Park.

# Estonia
#
# From Paul Eggert (2016-03-18):
# The 1989 transition is from USSR act No. 227 (1989-03-14).
#
# From Peter Ilieve (1994-10-15):
# A relative in Tallinn confirms the accuracy of the data for 1989 onwards
# [through 1994] and gives the legal authority for it,
# a regulation of the Government of Estonia, No. 111 of 1989....
#
# From Peter Ilieve (1996-10-28):
# [IATA SSIM (1992/1996) claims that the Baltic republics switch at 01:00s,
# but a relative confirms that Estonia still switches at 02:00s, writing:]
# "I do not [know] exactly but there are some little different
# (confusing) rules for International Air and Railway Transport Schedules
# conversion in Sunday connected with end of summer time in Estonia....
# A discussion is running about the summer time efficiency and effect on
# human physiology.  It seems that Estonia maybe will not change to
# summer time next spring."

# From Peter Ilieve (1998-11-04), heavily edited:
# The 1998-09-22 Estonian time law
# http://trip.rk.ee/cgi-bin/thw?${BASE}=akt&${OOHTML}=rtd&TA=1998&TO=1&AN=1390
# refers to the Eighth Directive and cites the association agreement between
# the EU and Estonia, ratified by the Estonian law (RT II 1995, 22-27, 120).
#
# I also asked [my relative] whether they use any standard abbreviation
# for their standard and summer times. He says no, they use "suveaeg"
# (summer time) and "talveaeg" (winter time).

# From The Baltic Times <http://www.baltictimes.com/> (1999-09-09)
# via Steffen Thorsen:
# This year will mark the last time Estonia shifts to summer time,
# a council of the ruling coalition announced Sept. 6....
# But what this could mean for Estonia's chances of joining the European
# Union are still unclear.  In 1994, the EU declared summer time compulsory
# for all member states until 2001.  Brussels has yet to decide what to do
# after that.

# From Mart Oruaas (2000-01-29):
# Regulation No. 301 (1999-10-12) obsoletes previous regulation
# No. 206 (1998-09-22) and thus sticks Estonia to +02:00 GMT for all
# the year round.  The regulation is effective 1999-11-01.

# From Toomas Soome (2002-02-21):
# The Estonian government has changed once again timezone politics.
# Now we are using again EU rules.
#
# From Urmet Jänes (2002-03-28):
# The legislative reference is Government decree No. 84 on 2002-02-21.

# Finland

# From Hannu Strang (1994-09-25 06:03:37 UTC):
# Well, here in Helsinki we're just changing from summer time to regular one,
# and it's supposed to change at 4am...

# From Janne Snabb (2010-07-15):
#
# I noticed that the Finland data is not accurate for years 1981 and 1982.
# During these two first trial years the DST adjustment was made one hour
# earlier than in forthcoming years. Starting 1983 the adjustment was made
# according to the central European standards.
#
# This is documented in Heikki Oja: Aikakirja 2007, published by The Almanac
# Office of University of Helsinki, ISBN 952-10-3221-9, available online (in
# Finnish) at
# http://almanakka.helsinki.fi/aikakirja/Aikakirja2007kokonaan.pdf
#
# Page 105 (56 in PDF version) has a handy table of all past daylight savings
# transitions. It is easy enough to interpret without Finnish skills.
#
# This is also confirmed by Finnish Broadcasting Company's archive at:
# http://www.yle.fi/elavaarkisto/?s=s&g=1&ag=5&t=&a=3401
#
# The news clip from 1981 says that "the time between 2 and 3 o'clock does not
# exist tonight."

# From Konstantin Hyppönen (2014-06-13):

# http://almanakka.helsinki.fi/images/aikakirja/Aikakirja2013kokonaan.pdf

# From Jörg Schilling (2002-10-23):
# In 1945, Berlin was switched to Moscow Summer time (GMT+4) by
# http://www.dhm.de/lemo/html/biografien/BersarinNikolai/
# General [Nikolai] Bersarin.

# From Paul Eggert (2003-03-08):
# http://www.parlament-berlin.de/pds-fraktion.nsf/727459127c8b66ee8525662300459099/defc77cb784f180ac1256c2b0030274b/$FILE/bersarint.pdf
# says that Bersarin issued an order to use Moscow time on May 20.
# However, Moscow did not observe daylight saving in 1945, so
# this was equivalent to UT +03, not +04.

# Iceland
#
# From Adam David (1993-11-06):
# The name of the timezone in Iceland for system / mail / news purposes is GMT.
#
# (1993-12-05):
# This material is paraphrased from the 1988 edition of the University of
# Iceland Almanak.
#
# From January 1st, 1908 the whole of Iceland was standardised at 1 hour
# behind GMT. Previously, local mean solar time was used in different parts
# of Iceland, the almanak had been based on Reykjavik mean solar time which
# was 1 hour and 28 minutes behind GMT.
#
# "first day of winter" referred to [below] means the first day of the 26 weeks
# of winter, according to the old icelandic calendar that dates back to the
# time the norsemen first settled Iceland.  The first day of winter is always
# Saturday, but is not dependent on the Julian or Gregorian calendars.
#
# (1993-12-10):
# I have a reference from the Oxford Icelandic-English dictionary for the
# beginning of winter, which ties it to the ecclesiastical calendar (and thus
# to the julian/gregorian calendar) over the period in question.
#	the winter begins on the Saturday next before St. Luke's day
#	(old style), or on St. Luke's day, if a Saturday.
# St. Luke's day ought to be traceable from ecclesiastical sources. "old style"
# might be a reference to the Julian calendar as opposed to Gregorian, or it
# might mean something else (???).
#
# From Paul Eggert (2014-11-22):
# The information below is taken from the 1988 Almanak; see

# Italy
#
# From Paul Eggert (2001-03-06):
# Sicily and Sardinia each had their own time zones from 1866 to 1893,
# called Palermo Time (+00:53:28) and Cagliari Time (+00:36:32).
# During World War II, German-controlled Italy used German time.
# But these events all occurred before the 1970 cutoff,
# so record only the time in Rome.
#
# From Michael Deckers (2016-10-24):
# http://www.ac-ilsestante.it/MERIDIANE/ora_legale quotes a law of 1893-08-10
# ... [translated as] "The preceding dispositions will enter into
# force at the instant at which, according to the time specified in
# the 1st article, the 1st of November 1893 will begin...."
#
# From Pierpaolo Bernardi (2016-10-20):
# The authoritative source for time in Italy is the national metrological
# institute, which has a summary page of historical DST data at
# http://www.inrim.it/res/tf/ora_legale_i.shtml
# (2016-10-24):
# http://www.renzobaldini.it/le-ore-legali-in-italia/
# has still different data for 1944.  It divides Italy in two, as
# there were effectively two governments at the time, north of Gothic
# Line German controlled territory, official government RSI, and south
# of the Gothic Line, controlled by allied armies.
#
# From Brian Inglis (2016-10-23):
# Viceregal LEGISLATIVE DECREE. 14 September 1944, no. 219.
# Restoration of Standard Time. (044U0219) (OJ 62 of 30.9.1944) ...
# Given the R. law decreed on 1944-03-29, no. 92, by which standard time is
# advanced to sixty minutes later starting at hour two on 1944-04-02; ...
# Starting at hour three on the date 1944-09-17 standard time will be resumed.
#
# From Paul Eggert (2016-10-27):
# Go with INRiM for DST rules, except as corrected by Inglis for 1944
# for the Kingdom of Italy.  This is consistent with Renzo Baldini.
# Model Rome's occupation by using using C-Eur rules from 1943-09-10
# to 1944-06-04; although Rome was an open city during this period, it
# was effectively controlled by Germany.

# Latvia

# From Liene Kanepe (1998-09-17):

# I asked about this matter Scientific Secretary of the Institute of Astronomy
# of The University of Latvia Dr. paed Mr. Ilgonis Vilks. I also searched the
# correct data in juridical acts and I found some juridical documents about
# changes in the counting of time in Latvia from 1981....
#
# Act No. 35 of the Council of Ministers of Latvian SSR of 1981-01-22 ...
# according to the Act No. 925 of the Council of Ministers of USSR of 1980-10-24
# ...: all year round the time of 2nd time zone + 1 hour, in addition turning
# the hands of the clock 1 hour forward on 1 April at 00:00 (GMT 31 March 21:00)
# and 1 hour backward on the 1 October at 00:00 (GMT 30 September 20:00).
#
# Act No. 592 of the Council of Ministers of Latvian SSR of 1984-09-24 ...
# according to the Act No. 967 of the Council of Ministers of USSR of 1984-09-13
# ...: all year round the time of 2nd time zone + 1 hour, in addition turning
# the hands of the clock 1 hour forward on the last Sunday of March at 02:00
# (GMT 23:00 on the previous day) and 1 hour backward on the last Sunday of
# September at 03:00 (GMT 23:00 on the previous day).
#
# Act No. 81 of the Council of Ministers of Latvian SSR of 1989-03-22 ...
# according to the Act No. 227 of the Council of Ministers of USSR of 1989-03-14
# ...: since the last Sunday of March 1989 in Lithuanian SSR, Latvian SSR,
# Estonian SSR and Kaliningrad region of Russian Federation all year round the
# time of 2nd time zone (Moscow time minus one hour). On the territory of Latvia
# transition to summer time is performed on the last Sunday of March at 02:00
# (GMT 00:00), turning the hands of the clock 1 hour forward.  The end of
# daylight saving time is performed on the last Sunday of September at 03:00
# (GMT 00:00), turning the hands of the clock 1 hour backward. Exception is
# 1989-03-26, when we must not turn the hands of the clock....
#
# The Regulations of the Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Latvia of
# 1997-01-21 on transition to Summer time ... established the same order of
# daylight savings time settings as in the States of the European Union.

# From Andrei Ivanov (2000-03-06):
# This year Latvia will not switch to Daylight Savings Time (as specified in
# The Regulations of the Cabinet of Ministers of the Rep. of Latvia of
# 29-Feb-2000 (No. 79) <http://www.lv-laiks.lv/wwwraksti/2000/071072/vd4.htm>,
# in Latvian for subscribers only).

# From RFE/RL Newsline
# http://www.rferl.org/newsline/2001/01/3-CEE/cee-030101.html
# (2001-01-03), noted after a heads-up by Rives McDow:
# The Latvian government on 2 January decided that the country will
# institute daylight-saving time this spring, LETA reported.
# Last February the three Baltic states decided not to turn back their
# clocks one hour in the spring....
# Minister of Economy Aigars Kalvītis noted that Latvia had too few
# daylight hours and thus decided to comply with a draft European
# Commission directive that provides for instituting daylight-saving
# time in EU countries between 2002 and 2006. The Latvian government
# urged Lithuania and Estonia to adopt a similar time policy, but it
# appears that they will not do so....

# ... confirms on p. 6 that Liechtenstein followed Switzerland in 1941 and 1942.
# I ... translate only the last two paragraphs:
#    ... during second world war, in the years 1941 and 1942, Liechtenstein
#    introduced daylight saving time, adapting to Switzerland.  From 1943 on
#    central European time was in force throughout the year.

# From Paul Eggert (2016-03-18):
# The 1989 transition is from USSR act No. 227 (1989-03-14).

# From Paul Eggert (1996-11-22):
# IATA SSIM (1992/1996) says Lithuania uses W-Eur rules, but since it is
# known to be wrong about Estonia and Latvia, assume it's wrong here too.

# From Marius Gedminas (1998-08-07):
# I would like to inform that in this year Lithuanian time zone
# (Europe/Vilnius) was changed.

# From ELTA No. 972 (2582) (1999-09-29) <http://www.elta.lt/>,
# via Steffen Thorsen:
# Lithuania has shifted back to the second time zone (GMT plus two hours)
# to be valid here starting from October 31,
# as decided by the national government on Wednesday....
# The Lithuanian government also announced plans to consider a
# motion to give up shifting to summer time in spring, as it was
# already done by Estonia.

# From the Fact File, Lithuanian State Department of Tourism
# <http://www.tourism.lt/informa/ff.htm> (2000-03-27):
# Local time is GMT+2 hours ..., no daylight saving.

# From a user via Klaus Marten (2003-02-07):
# As a candidate for membership of the European Union, Lithuania will
# observe Summer Time in 2003, changing its clocks at the times laid
# down in EU Directive 2000/84 of 19.I.01 (i.e. at the same times as its
# neighbour Latvia). The text of the Lithuanian government Order of
# 7.XI.02 to this effect can be found at

# Moldova

# From Stepan Golosunov (2016-03-07):
# the act of the government of the Republic of Moldova Nr. 132 from 1990-05-04
# http://lex.justice.md/viewdoc.php?action=view&view=doc&id=298782&lang=2
# ... says that since 1990-05-06 on the territory of the Moldavian SSR
# time would be calculated as the standard time of the second time belt
# plus one hour of the "summer" time. To implement that clocks would be
# adjusted one hour backwards at 1990-05-06 2:00. After that "summer"
# time would be cancelled last Sunday of September at 3:00 and
# reintroduced last Sunday of March at 2:00.

# From Paul Eggert (2006-03-22):
# A previous version of this database followed Shanks & Pottenger, who write
# that Tiraspol switched to Moscow time on 1992-01-19 at 02:00.
# However, this is most likely an error, as Moldova declared independence
# on 1991-08-27 (the 1992-01-19 date is that of a Russian decree).
# In early 1992 there was large-scale interethnic violence in the area
# and it's possible that some Russophones continued to observe Moscow time.
# But [two people] separately reported via
# Jesper Nørgaard that as of 2001-01-24 Tiraspol was like Chisinau.
# The Tiraspol entry has therefore been removed for now.
#
# From Alexander Krivenyshev (2011-10-17):
# Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic (PMR, also known as
# "Pridnestrovie") has abolished seasonal clock change (no transition
# to the Winter Time).
#
# News (in Russian):
# http://www.kyivpost.ua/russia/news/pridnestrove-otkazalos-ot-perehoda-na-zimnee-vremya-30954.html
# http://www.allmoldova.com/moldova-news/1249064116.html
#
# The substance of this change (reinstatement of the Tiraspol entry)
# is from a patch from Petr Machata (2011-10-17)
#
# From Tim Parenti (2011-10-19)
# In addition, being situated at +4651+2938 would give Tiraspol
# a pre-1880 LMT offset of 1:58:32.
#
# (which agrees with the earlier entry that had been removed)
#
# From Alexander Krivenyshev (2011-10-26)
# NO need to divide Moldova into two timezones at this point.
# As of today, Transnistria (Pridnestrovie)- Tiraspol reversed its own
# decision to abolish DST this winter.
# Following Moldova and neighboring Ukraine- Transnistria (Pridnestrovie)-
# Tiraspol will go back to winter time on October 30, 2011.

# From Roman Tudos (2015-07-02):
# http://lex.justice.md/index.php?action=view&view=doc&lang=1&id=355077
# From Paul Eggert (2015-07-01):
# The abovementioned official link to IGO1445-868/2014 states that

# http://www.trm.md/en/social/la-30-martie-vom-trece-la-ora-de-vara
# says the 2014-03-30 spring-forward transition was at 02:00 local time.

# Netherlands

# Howse writes that the Netherlands' railways used GMT between 1892 and 1940,
# but for other purposes the Netherlands used Amsterdam mean time.

# However, Robert H. van Gent writes (2001-04-01):
# Howse's statement is only correct up to 1909. From 1909-05-01 (00:00:00
# Amsterdam mean time) onwards, the whole of the Netherlands (including
# the Dutch railways) was required by law to observe Amsterdam mean time
# (19 minutes 32.13 seconds ahead of GMT). This had already been the
# common practice (except for the railways) for many decades but it was
# not until 1909 when the Dutch government finally defined this by law.
# On 1937-07-01 this was changed to 20 minutes (exactly) ahead of GMT and
# was generally known as Dutch Time ("Nederlandse Tijd").
#
# (2001-04-08):
# 1892-05-01 was the date when the Dutch railways were by law required to
# observe GMT while the remainder of the Netherlands adhered to the common
# practice of following Amsterdam mean time.
#
# (2001-04-09):
# In 1835 the authorities of the province of North Holland requested the
# municipal authorities of the towns and cities in the province to observe
# Amsterdam mean time but I do not know in how many cases this request was
# actually followed.
#
# From 1852 onwards the Dutch telegraph offices were by law required to
# observe Amsterdam mean time. As the time signals from the observatory of
# Leiden were also distributed by the telegraph system, I assume that most
# places linked up with the telegraph (and railway) system automatically
# adopted Amsterdam mean time.
#
# Although the early Dutch railway companies initially observed a variety
# of times, most of them had adopted Amsterdam mean time by 1858 but it
# was not until 1866 when they were all required by law to observe
# Amsterdam mean time.

# Svalbard & Jan Mayen

# From Steffen Thorsen (2001-05-01):
# Although I could not find it explicitly, it seems that Jan Mayen and
# Svalbard have been using the same time as Norway at least since the
# time they were declared as parts of Norway.  Svalbard was declared
# as a part of Norway by law of 1925-07-17 no 11, section 4 and Jan
# Mayen by law of 1930-02-27 no 2, section 2. (From
# <http://www.lovdata.no/all/nl-19250717-011.html> and
# <http://www.lovdata.no/all/nl-19300227-002.html>).  The law/regulation
# for normal/standard time in Norway is from 1894-06-29 no 1 (came
# into operation on 1895-01-01) and Svalbard/Jan Mayen seem to be a
# part of this law since 1925/1930. (From
# <http://www.lovdata.no/all/nl-18940629-001.html>) I have not been
# able to find if Jan Mayen used a different time zone (e.g. -0100)
# before 1930. Jan Mayen has only been "inhabited" since 1921 by
# Norwegian meteorologists and maybe used the same time as Norway ever
# since 1921.  Svalbard (Arctic/Longyearbyen) has been inhabited since
# before 1895, and therefore probably changed the local time somewhere
# between 1895 and 1925 (inclusive).

# From Paul Eggert (2013-09-04):
#
# Actually, Jan Mayen was never occupied by Germany during World War II,
# so it must have diverged from Oslo time during the war, as Oslo was
# keeping Berlin time.
#
# <http://home.no.net/janmayen/history.htm> says that the meteorologists
# burned down their station in 1940 and left the island, but returned in
# 1941 with a small Norwegian garrison and continued operations despite
# frequent air attacks from Germans.  In 1943 the Americans established a
# radiolocating station on the island, called "Atlantic City".  Possibly
# the UT offset changed during the war, but I think it unlikely that
# Jan Mayen used German daylight-saving rules.
#
# Svalbard is more complicated, as it was raided in August 1941 by an
# Allied party that evacuated the civilian population to England (says
# <http://www.bartleby.com/65/sv/Svalbard.html>).  The Svalbard FAQ
# <http://www.svalbard.com/SvalbardFAQ.html> says that the Germans were
# expelled on 1942-05-14.  However, small parties of Germans did return,
# and according to Wilhelm Dege's book "War North of 80" (1954)
# http://www.ucalgary.ca/UofC/departments/UP/1-55238/1-55238-110-2.html
# the German armed forces at the Svalbard weather station code-named
# Haudegen did not surrender to the Allies until September 1945.
#
# All these events predate our cutoff date of 1970, so use Europe/Oslo
# for these regions.

# Portugal
#
# From Paul Eggert (2014-08-11), after a heads-up from Stephen Colebourne:
# According to a Portuguese decree (1911-05-26)
# http://dre.pt/pdf1sdip/1911/05/12500/23132313.pdf
# Lisbon was at -0:36:44.68, but switched to GMT on 1912-01-01 at 00:00.
# Round the old offset to -0:36:45.  This agrees with Willett but disagrees
# with Shanks, who says the transition occurred on 1911-05-24 at 00:00 for
# Europe/Lisbon, Atlantic/Azores, and Atlantic/Madeira.
#
# From Rui Pedro Salgueiro (1992-11-12):
# Portugal has recently (September, 27) changed timezone
# (from WET to MET or CET) to harmonize with EEC.
#
# Martin Bruckmann (1996-02-29) reports via Peter Ilieve
# that Portugal is reverting to 0:00 by not moving its clocks this spring.
# The new Prime Minister was fed up with getting up in the dark in the winter.
#
# From Paul Eggert (1996-11-12):
# IATA SSIM (1991-09) reports several 1991-09 and 1992-09 transitions
# at 02:00u, not 01:00u.  Assume that these are typos.
# IATA SSIM (1991/1992) reports that the Azores were at -1:00.
# IATA SSIM (1993-02) says +0:00; later issues (through 1996-09) say -1:00.
# Guess that the Azores changed to EU rules in 1992 (since that's when Portugal
# harmonized with the EU), and that they stayed +0:00 that winter.

# Russia

# From Alexander Krivenyshev (2011-09-15):
# Based on last Russian Government Decree No. 725 on August 31, 2011
# (Government document
# http://www.government.ru/gov/results/16355/print/
# in Russian)
# there are few corrections have to be made for some Russian time zones...
# All updated Russian Time Zones were placed in table and translated to English
# by WorldTimeZone.com at the link below:
# http://www.worldtimezone.com/dst_news/dst_news_russia36.htm

# From Sanjeev Gupta (2011-09-27):
# Scans of [Decree No. 23 of January 8, 1992] are available at:
# http://government.consultant.ru/page.aspx?1223966
# They are in Cyrillic letters (presumably Russian).

# From Arthur David Olson (2012-05-09):
# Regarding the instant when clocks in time-zone-shifting parts of Russia
# changed in September 2011:
#
# One source is
# http://government.ru/gov/results/16355/
# which, according to translate.google.com, begins "Decree of August 31,
# 2011 No. 725" and contains no other dates or "effective date" information.
#
# Another source is
# http://www.rg.ru/2011/09/06/chas-zona-dok.html
# which, according to translate.google.com, begins "Resolution of the
# Government of the Russian Federation on August 31, 2011 N 725" and also
# contains "Date first official publication: September 6, 2011 Posted on:
# in the 'RG' - Federal Issue No. 5573 September 6, 2011" but which
# does not contain any "effective date" information.
#
# Another source is
# http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oymyakonsky_District#cite_note-RuTime-7
# which, in note 8, contains "Resolution No. 725 of August 31, 2011...
# Effective as of after 7 days following the day of the official publication"
# but which does not contain any reference to September 6, 2011.
#
# The Wikipedia article refers to
# http://base.consultant.ru/cons/cgi/online.cgi?req=doc;base=LAW;n=118896
# which seems to copy the text of the government.ru page.
#
# Tobias Conradi combines Wikipedia's
# "as of after 7 days following the day of the official publication"
# with www.rg.ru's "Date of first official publication: September 6, 2011" to
# get September 13, 2011 as the cutover date (unusually, a Tuesday, as Tobias
# Conradi notes).
#
# None of the sources indicates a time of day for changing clocks.
#
# Go with 2011-09-13 0:00s.

# From Alexander Krivenyshev (2014-07-01):
# According to the Russian news (ITAR-TASS News Agency)
# http://en.itar-tass.com/russia/738562
# the State Duma has approved ... the draft bill on returning to

# From October 26, 2014 the new Russian time zone map will looks like this:
# http://www.worldtimezone.com/dst_news/dst_news_russia-map-2014-07.html

# From Paul Eggert (2006-03-22):
# Moscow time zone abbreviations after 1919-07-01, and Moscow rules after 1991,
# are from Andrey A. Chernov.  The rest is from Shanks & Pottenger,
# except we follow Chernov's report that 1992 DST transitions were Sat
# 23:00, not Sun 02:00s.
#
# From Stanislaw A. Kuzikowski (1994-06-29):
# But now it is some months since Novosibirsk is 3 hours ahead of Moscow!
# I do not know why they have decided to make this change;
# as far as I remember it was done exactly during winter->summer switching
# so we (Novosibirsk) simply did not switch.
#
# From Andrey A. Chernov (1996-10-04):
# 'MSK' and 'MSD' were born and used initially on Moscow computers with
# UNIX-like OSes by several developer groups (e.g. Demos group, Kiae group)....
# The next step was the UUCP network, the Relcom predecessor
# (used mainly for mail), and MSK/MSD was actively used there.
#
# From Chris Carrier (1996-10-30):
# According to a friend of mine who rode the Trans-Siberian Railroad from
# Moscow to Irkutsk in 1995, public air and rail transport in Russia ...
# still follows Moscow time, no matter where in Russia it is located.
#
# For Grozny, Chechnya, we have the following story from
# John Daniszewski, "Scavengers in the Rubble", Los Angeles Times (2001-02-07):
# News - often false - is spread by word of mouth.  A rumor that it was
# time to move the clocks back put this whole city out of sync with
# the rest of Russia for two weeks - even soldiers stationed here began
# enforcing curfew at the wrong time.
#
# From Gwillim Law (2001-06-05):
# There's considerable evidence that Sakhalin Island used to be in
# UTC+11, and has changed to UTC+10, in this decade.  I start with the
# SSIM, which listed Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk in zone RU10 along with Magadan
# until February 1997, and then in RU9 with Khabarovsk and Vladivostok
# since September 1997....  Although the Kuril Islands are
# administratively part of Sakhalin oblast', they appear to have
# remained on UTC+11 along with Magadan.

# The second link provides two articles scanned from the Nauka i Zhizn
# magazine No. 3, 1981 and a scan of the short article attributed to
# the Trud newspaper from February 1982.  The first link provides the
# same Nauka i Zhizn articles converted to the text form (but misses
# time belt changes map).
#
# The second Nauka i Zhizn article says that in addition to
# introduction of summer time on 1981-04-01 there are some time belt
# border changes on 1981-10-01, mostly affecting Nenets Autonomous
# Okrug, Krasnoyarsk Krai, Yakutia, Magadan Oblast and Chukotka
# according to the provided map (colored one).  In addition to that
# "time violators" (regions which were not using rules of the time
# belts in which they were located) would not be moving off the DST on
# 1981-10-01 to restore the decree time usage.  (Komi ASSR was
# supposed to repeat that move in October 1982 to account for the 2
# hour difference.)  Map depicting "time violators" before 1981-10-01
# is also provided.
#
# The article from Trud says that 1981-10-01 changes caused problems
# and some territories would be moved to pre-1981-10-01 time by not
# moving to summer time on 1982-04-01.  Namely: Dagestan,
# Kabardino-Balkar, Kalmyk, Komi, Mari, Mordovian, North Ossetian,
# Tatar, Chechen-Ingush and Chuvash ASSR, Krasnodar and Stavropol
# krais, Arkhangelsk, Vladimir, Vologda, Voronezh, Gorky, Ivanovo,
# Kostroma, Lipetsk, Penza, Rostov, Ryazan, Tambov, Tyumen and
# Yaroslavl oblasts, Nenets and Evenk autonomous okrugs, Khatangsky
# district of Taymyr Autonomous Okrug.  As a result Evenk Autonomous
# Okrug and Khatangsky district of Taymyr Autonomous Okrug would end
# up on Moscow+4, Tyumen Oblast on Moscow+2 and the rest on Moscow
# time.
#
# http://astrozet.net/files/Zones/DOC/RU/1980-925.txt
# attributes the 1982 changes to the Act of the Council of Ministers
# of the USSR No. 126 from 18.02.1982.  1980-925.txt also adds
# Udmurtia to the list of affected territories and lists Khatangsky
# district separately from Taymyr Autonomous Okrug.  Probably erroneously.
#
# The affected territories are currently listed under Europe/Moscow,
# Asia/Yekaterinburg and Asia/Krasnoyarsk.
#
# 12. Udmurtia
# The fact that Udmurtia is depicted as a violator in the Nauka i
# Zhizn article hints at Izhevsk being on different time from
# Kuybyshev before 1981-10-01. Udmurtia is not mentioned in the 1989 act.
# http://astrozet.net/files/Zones/DOC/RU/1980-925.txt
# implies Udmurtia was on Moscow time after 1982-04-01.
# Wikipedia implies Udmurtia being on Moscow+1 until 1991.
#
# ...
#
# All Russian zones are supposed to have by default a -1 change at
# 1991-03-31 2:00 (cancellation of the decree time in the USSR) and a +1
# change at 1992-01-19 2:00 (restoration of the decree time in Russia).
#
# There were some exceptions, though.
# Wikipedia says newspapers listed Astrakhan, Saratov, Kirov, Volgograd,
# Izhevsk, Grozny, Kazan and Samara as such exceptions for the 1992
# change. (Different newspapers providing different lists. And some
# lists found in the internet are quite wild.)
#
# And apparently some exceptions were reverted in the last moment.
# http://www.kaliningradka.ru/site_pc/cherez/index.php?ELEMENT_ID=40091
# says that Kaliningrad decided not to be an exception 2 days before the
# 1991-03-31 switch and one person at
# http://izhevsk.ru/forum_light_message/50/682597-m8369040.html
# says he remembers that Samara opted out of the 1992-01-19 exception
# 2 days before the switch.

# From Paul Eggert (2016-03-18):
# Given the above, we appear to be missing some Zone entries for the
# chaotic early 1980s in Russia.  It's not clear what these entries
# should be.  For now, sweep this under the rug and just document the
# time in Moscow.

# From Vladimir Karpinsky (2014-07-08):
# LMT in Moscow (before Jul 3, 1916) is 2:30:17, that was defined by Moscow
# Observatory (coordinates: 55 deg. 45'29.70", 37 deg. 34'05.30")....
# LMT in Moscow since Jul 3, 1916 is 2:31:01 as a result of new standard.
# (The info is from the book by Byalokoz ... p. 18.)
# The time in St. Petersburg as capital of Russia was defined by
# Pulkov observatory, near St. Petersburg.  In 1916 LMT Moscow
# was synchronized with LMT St. Petersburg (+30 minutes), (Pulkov observatory
# coordinates: 59 deg. 46'18.70", 30 deg. 19'40.70") so 30 deg. 19'40.70" >
# 2h01m18.7s = 2:01:19.  LMT Moscow = LMT St.Petersburg + 30m 2:01:19 + 0:30 =
# 2:31:19 ...
#
# From Paul Eggert (2014-07-08):
# Milne does not list Moscow, but suggests that its time might be listed in
# Résumés mensuels et annuels des observations météorologiques (1895).
# Presumably this is OCLC 85825704, a journal published with parallel text in
# Russian and French.  This source has not been located; go with Karpinsky.

# From Alexander Krivenyshev (2009-10-13):
# Kemerovo oblast' (Kemerovo region) in Russia will change current time zone on
# March 28, 2010:
# from current Russia Zone 6 - Krasnoyarsk Time Zone (KRA) UTC +0700
# to Russia Zone 5 - Novosibirsk Time Zone (NOV) UTC +0600
#
# This is according to Government of Russia decree No. 740, on September
# 14, 2009 "Application in the territory of the Kemerovo region the Fifth
# time zone." ("Russia Zone 5" or old "USSR Zone 5" is GMT +0600)

# Thus, when Russia will switch to DST on the night of March 28, 2010
# Kemerovo region (Kemerovo oblast') will not change the clock.

# From Tim Parenti (2014-07-02), per Alexander Krivenyshev (2014-07-02):
# The Kemerovo region will remain at UTC+7 through the 2014-10-26 change, thus
# realigning itself with KRAT.

# From Tim Parenti (2014-07-02):
# Oymyakonsky District of Sakha Republic (represented by Ust-Nera), along with
# most of Sakhalin Oblast (represented by Sakhalin) will be moving to UTC+10 on
# 2014-10-26 to stay aligned with VLAT/SAKT; however, Severo-Kurilsky District

# From Tim Parenti (2014-07-06):
# Assume North Kuril Islands have history like Magadan before 2011-03-27.
# There is a decent chance this is wrong, in which case a new zone
# Asia/Severo-Kurilsk would become necessary.
#
# Srednekolymsk and Zyryanka are the most populous places amongst these
# districts, but have very similar populations.  In fact, Wikipedia currently
# lists them both as having 3528 people, exactly 1668 males and 1860 females

# Assume this is a mistake, albeit an amusing one.
#
# Looking at censuses, the populations of the two municipalities seem to have
# fluctuated recently.  Zyryanka was more populous than Srednekolymsk in the
# 1989 and 2002 censuses, but Srednekolymsk was more populous in the most
# recent (2010) census, 3525 to 3170.  (See pages 195 and 197 of

# http://astronomia.ign.es/rknowsys-theme/images/webAstro/paginas/documentos/Anuario/lahoraoficialenespana.pdf
# As this source says that historical time in the Canaries is obscure,
# and it does not discuss Ceuta, stick with Shanks for now for that data.
#
# In the 1918 and 1919 fallback transitions in Spain, the clock for
# the hour-longer day officially kept going after midnight, so that
# the repeated instances of that day's 00:00 hour were 24 hours apart,
# with a fallback transition from the second occurrence of 00:59... to
# the next day's 00:00.  Our data format cannot represent this
# directly, and instead repeats the first hour of the next day, with a

# Sweden

# From Ivan Nilsson (2001-04-13), superseding Shanks & Pottenger:
#
# The law "Svensk författningssamling 1878, no 14" about standard time in 1879:
# From the beginning of 1879 (that is 01-01 00:00) the time for all
# places in the country is "the mean solar time for the meridian at
# three degrees, or twelve minutes of time, to the west of the
# meridian of the Observatory of Stockholm".  The law is dated 1878-05-31.
#
# The observatory at that time had the meridian 18 degrees 03' 30"
# eastern longitude = 01:12:14 in time.  Less 12 minutes gives the
# national standard time as 01:00:14 ahead of GMT....
#
# About the beginning of CET in Sweden. The lawtext ("Svensk
# författningssamling 1899, no 44") states, that "from the beginning
# of 1900... ... the same as the mean solar time for the meridian at
# the distance of one hour of time from the meridian of the English
# observatory at Greenwich, or at 12 minutes 14 seconds to the west
# from the meridian of the Observatory of Stockholm". The law is dated
# 1899-06-16.  In short: At 1900-01-01 00:00:00 the new standard time
# in Sweden is 01:00:00 ahead of GMT.
#
# 1916: The lawtext ("Svensk författningssamling 1916, no 124") states
# that "1916-05-15 is considered to begin one hour earlier". It is
# pretty obvious that at 05-14 23:00 the clocks are set to 05-15 00:00....
# Further the law says, that "1916-09-30 is considered to end one hour later".
#
# The laws regulating [DST] are available on the site of the Swedish
# Parliament beginning with 1985 - the laws regulating 1980/1984 are
# not available on the site (to my knowledge they are only available
# in Swedish): <http://www.riksdagen.se/english/work/sfst.asp> (type
# "sommartid" without the quotes in the field "Fritext" and then click
# the Sök-button).
#
# (2001-05-13):
#
# I have now found a newspaper stating that at 1916-10-01 01:00
# summertime the church-clocks etc were set back one hour to show
# 1916-10-01 00:00 standard time.  The article also reports that some
# people thought the switch to standard time would take place already
# at 1916-10-01 00:00 summer time, but they had to wait for another
# hour before the event took place.

# Switzerland
# From Howse:

# and their performance improved enormously.  Communities began to keep

# Rule	NAME	FROM	TO	TYPE	IN	ON	AT	SAVE	LETTER/S

# From Alois Treindl (2008-12-17):
# I have researched the DST usage in Switzerland during the 1940ies.
#
# As I wrote in an earlier message, I suspected the current tzdata values
# to be wrong. This is now verified.
#
# I have found copies of the original ruling by the Swiss Federal
# government, in 'Eidgenössische Gesetzessammlung 1941 and 1942' (Swiss
# federal law collection)...
#
# DST began on Monday 5 May 1941, 1:00 am by shifting the clocks to 2:00 am
# DST ended on Monday 6 Oct 1941, 2:00 am by shifting the clocks to 1:00 am.
#
# DST began on Monday, 4 May 1942 at 01:00 am
# DST ended on Monday, 5 Oct 1942 at 02:00 am
#
# There was no DST in 1940, I have checked the law collection carefully.
# It is also indicated by the fact that the 1942 entry in the law
# collection points back to 1941 as a reference, but no reference to any
# other years are made.
#
# Newspaper articles I have read in the archives on 6 May 1941 reported
# about the introduction of DST (Sommerzeit in German) during the previous
# night as an absolute novelty, because this was the first time that such
# a thing had happened in Switzerland.
#
# I have also checked 1916, because one book source (Gabriel, Traité de
# l'heure dans le monde) claims that Switzerland had DST in 1916. This is
# false, no official document could be found. Probably Gabriel got misled
# by references to Germany, which introduced DST in 1916 for the first time.
#
# The tzdata rules for Switzerland must be changed to:
# Rule  Swiss   1941    1942    -       May     Mon>=1  1:00    1:00    S
# Rule  Swiss   1941    1942    -       Oct     Mon>=1  2:00    0       -
#
# The 1940 rules must be deleted.
#
# One further detail for Switzerland, which is probably out of scope for
# most users of tzdata: The [Europe/Zurich zone] ...
# describes all of Switzerland correctly, with the exception of
# the Canton de Genève (Geneva, Genf). Between 1848 and 1894 Geneva did not
# follow Bern Mean Time but kept its own local mean time.
# To represent this, an extra zone would be needed.
#
# From Alois Treindl (2013-09-11):
# The Federal regulations say
# http://www.admin.ch/opc/de/classified-compilation/20071096/index.html
# ... the meridian for Bern mean time ... is 7 degrees 26' 22.50".
# Expressed in time, it is 0h29m45.5s.

# From Pierre-Yves Berger (2013-09-11):
# the "Circulaire du conseil fédéral" (December 11 1893)
# http://www.amtsdruckschriften.bar.admin.ch/viewOrigDoc.do?id=10071353
# clearly states that the [1894-06-01] change should be done at midnight
# but if no one is present after 11 at night, could be postponed until one
# hour before the beginning of service.

# From Paul Eggert (2013-09-11):
# Round BMT to the nearest even second, 0:29:46.
#
# We can find no reliable source for Shanks's assertion that all of Switzerland
# except Geneva switched to Bern Mean Time at 00:00 on 1848-09-12.  This book:
#
#	Jakob Messerli. Gleichmässig, pünktlich, schnell. Zeiteinteilung und
#	Zeitgebrauch in der Schweiz im 19. Jahrhundert. Chronos, Zurich 1995,
#	ISBN 3-905311-68-2, OCLC 717570797.
#
# suggests that the transition was more gradual, and that the Swiss did not
# agree about civil time during the transition.  The timekeeping it gives the
# most detail for is postal and telegraph time: here, federal legislation (the
# "Bundesgesetz über die Erstellung von elektrischen Telegraphen") passed on
# 1851-11-23, and an official implementation notice was published 1853-07-16
# (Bundesblatt 1853, Bd. II, S. 859).  On p 72 Messerli writes that in
# practice since July 1853 Bernese time was used in "all postal and telegraph
# offices in Switzerland from Geneva to St. Gallen and Basel to Chiasso"
# (Google translation).  For now, model this transition as occurring on
# 1853-07-16, though it probably occurred at some other date in Zurich, and
# legal civil time probably changed at still some other transition date.

# Ukraine
#
# From Igor Karpov, who works for the Ukrainian Ministry of Justice,
# via Garrett Wollman (2003-01-27):
# BTW, I've found the official document on this matter. It's government
# regulations No. 509, May 13, 1996. In my poor translation it says:
# "Time in Ukraine is set to second timezone (Kiev time). Each last Sunday
# of March at 3am the time is changing to 4am and each last Sunday of
# October the time at 4am is changing to 3am"

# From Alexander Krivenyshev (2011-09-20):
# On September 20, 2011 the deputies of the Verkhovna Rada agreed to
# abolish the transfer clock to winter time.
#
# Bill No. 8330 of MP from the Party of Regions Oleg Nadoshi got
# approval from 266 deputies.
#
# Ukraine abolishes transfer back to the winter time (in Russian)
# http://news.mail.ru/politics/6861560/
#
# The Ukrainians will no longer change the clock (in Russian)
# http://www.segodnya.ua/news/14290482.html
#
# Deputies cancelled the winter time (in Russian)
# http://www.pravda.com.ua/rus/news/2011/09/20/6600616/
#
# From Philip Pizzey (2011-10-18):
# Today my Ukrainian colleagues have informed me that the
# Ukrainian parliament have decided that they will go to winter
# time this year after all.
#
# From Udo Schwedt (2011-10-18):
# As far as I understand, the recent change to the Ukrainian time zone
# (Europe/Kiev) to introduce permanent daylight saving time (similar
# to Russia) was reverted today:
# http://portal.rada.gov.ua/rada/control/en/publish/article/info_left?art_id=287324&cat_id=105995
#
# Also reported by Alexander Bokovoy (2011-10-18) who also noted:
# The law documents themselves are at
# http://w1.c1.rada.gov.ua/pls/zweb_n/webproc4_1?id=&pf3511=41484

# From Vladimir in Moscow via Alois Treindl re Kiev time 1991/2 (2014-02-28):
# First in Ukraine they changed Time zone from UTC+3 to UTC+2 with DST:
#       03 25 1990 02:00 -03.00 1       Time Zone 3 with DST
#       07 01 1990 02:00 -02.00 1       Time Zone 2 with DST
# * Ukrainian Government's Resolution of 18.06.1990, No. 134.
# http://search.ligazakon.ua/l_doc2.nsf/link1/T001500.html
#
# They did not end DST in September, 1990 (according to the law,
# "summer time" was still in action):
#       09 30 1990 03:00 -02.00 1       Time Zone 2 with DST
# * Ukrainian Government's Resolution of 21.09.1990, No. 272.
# http://search.ligazakon.ua/l_doc2.nsf/link1/KP900272.html
#
# Again no change in March, 1991 ("summer time" in action):
#       03 31 1991 02:00 -02.00 1       Time Zone 2 with DST
#
# DST ended in September 1991 ("summer time" ended):
#       09 29 1991 03:00 -02.00 0       Time Zone 2, no DST
# * Ukrainian Government's Resolution of 25.09.1991, No. 225.
# http://www.uazakon.com/documents/date_21/pg_iwgdoc.htm
# This is an answer.
#
# Since 1992 they had normal DST procedure:
#       03 29 1992 02:00 -02.00 1       DST started
#       09 27 1992 03:00 -02.00 0       DST ended
# * Ukrainian Government's Resolution of 20.03.1992, No. 139.

# One source shows that Bulgaria, Cyprus, Finland, and Greece observe DST from
# the last Sunday in March to the last Sunday in September in 1986.
# The source shows Romania changing a day later than everybody else.
#
# According to Bernard Sieloff's source, Poland is in the MET time zone but
# uses the WE DST rules.  The Western USSR uses EET+1 and ME DST rules.
# Bernard Sieloff's source claims Romania switches on the same day, but at
# 00:00 standard time (i.e., 01:00 DST).  It also claims that Turkey
# switches on the same day, but switches on at 01:00 standard time
# and off at 00:00 standard time (i.e., 01:00 DST)

# ...
# Date: Wed, 28 Jan 87 16:56:27 -0100
# From: Tom Hofmann
# ...
#
# ...the European time rules are...standardized since 1981, when
# most European countries started DST.  Before that year, only
# a few countries (UK, France, Italy) had DST, each according
# to own national rules.  In 1981, however, DST started on
# 'Apr firstSun', and not on 'Mar lastSun' as in the following
# years...
# But also since 1981 there are some more national exceptions
# than listed in 'europe': Switzerland, for example, joined DST
# one year later, Denmark ended DST on 'Oct 1' instead of 'Sep
# lastSun' in 1981 - I don't know how they handle now.
#
# Finally, DST ist always from 'Apr 1' to 'Oct 1' in the
# Soviet Union (as far as I know).
#
# Tom Hofmann, Scientific Computer Center, CIBA-GEIGY AG,
# 4002 Basle, Switzerland
# ...

# ...
# Date: Wed, 4 Feb 87 22:35:22 +0100
# From: Dik T. Winter
# ...
#
# The information from Tom Hofmann is (as far as I know) not entirely correct.
# After a request from chongo at amdahl I tried to retrieve all information
# about DST in Europe.  I was able to find all from about 1969.
#
# ...standardization on DST in Europe started in about 1977 with switches on
# first Sunday in April and last Sunday in September...
# In 1981 UK joined Europe insofar that
# the starting day for both shifted to last Sunday in March.  And from 1982
# the whole of Europe used DST, with switch dates April 1 and October 1 in
# the Sov[i]et Union.  In 1985 the SU reverted to standard Europe[a]n switch
# dates...
#
# It should also be remembered that time-zones are not constants; e.g.
# Portugal switched in 1976 from MET (or CET) to WET with DST...
# Note also that though there were rules for switch dates not
# all countries abided to these dates, and many individual deviations
# occurred, though not since 1982 I believe.  Another note: it is always
# assumed that DST is 1 hour ahead of normal time, this need not be the
# case; at least in the Netherlands there have been times when DST was 2 hours
# in advance of normal time.
#
# ...
# dik t. winter, cwi, amsterdam, nederland
# ...

# From Bob Devine (1988-01-28):
# ...
# Greece: Last Sunday in April to last Sunday in September (iffy on dates).
# Since 1978.  Change at midnight.
# ...
# Monaco: has same DST as France.

# says the autumn 1995 switch was at 02:00.
# Stick with W-Eur for now.
#
# From Marcin Kasperski (1999-06-10):
# According to my colleagues someone recently decided, that Poland would
# follow European Union regulations, so - I think - the matter is not
# worth further discussion.
#
# From Paul Eggert (1999-06-10):
# Kasperski also writes that the government futzed with the rules in 1997
# or 1998 but he doesn't remember the details.  Assume they switched to
# EU rules in 1999.

# From Peter Ilieve <peter@@aldie.co.uk> (1998-04-19):
# The following list attempts to show the complete history of Summer Time
# legislation in the United Kingdom, and has quite a bit to say about
# the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands as well.
#
# Things that I have not personally seen are marked (???). Things that
# I haven't seen but Joseph Myers has are marked (jsm). The problem
# with finding old Orders (rather than Acts) is that nobody seems to
# keep the actual documents themselves, not even the Government. They
# get bound into annual volumes, which are published, but by the time
# this happens the Orders are mainly spent as the years they refer
# to have come and gone, so they don't get included in the annual
# volumes.
#
# Thanks are due to my learned legal friend Lorna Montgomerie, who dug out
# the dusty old statutes, to Melanie Allison of the Ministry of Defence,
# who provided the wartime regulations and a snippet of Hansard explaining
# why double summer time started on a Monday in 1945 (it was Easter),
# and to Joseph Myers <jsm28@@cam.ac.uk>, who tracked down the Orders
# up to 1945, some of the old Acts, and the first five EC Directives.
#
# Some definitions:
#
# Great Britain: England, Scotland and Wales
# United Kingdom: Great Britain plus Ireland (up to 1922) or Northern
# Ireland (since 1922)
# S.I.: Statutory Instrument, the modern name for secondary legislation
# S.R.&O.: Statutory Rules and Orders, the older name for secondary legislation
#
# Unless otherwise specified, Acts and secondary legislation are assumed
# to apply throughout the United Kingdom, but not to the Isle of Man
# or the Channel Islands.
#
# Some of the Acts and Orders I found in various libraries, and I don't
# have copies. When I looked at them I was looking for dates and not things
# like whether they applied to the Bailiwick of Jersey. I will try to
# check these documents again.

#
# - The Statutes (Definition of Time) Act, 1880 (43 & 44 Vict. c. 9)
#
# Defined Greenwich mean time to be the standard time in Great Britain
# and Dublin mean time to be the standard time in Ireland, superseding
# various forms of local mean time.
#
# - The Statutory Time Act, 1883 (???)
#
# An Act of Tynwald, the Isle of Man Parliament. It appears to have
# defined the standard time on the Isle of Man as GMT but as I haven't
# seen it I don't know if it used Greenwich mean time, some other definition,
# or just said that Isle of Man time would be the same as in Great Britain.
#
# - The Isle of Man (War Legislation) Act, 1914 (4 & 5 Geo. 5. c. 62)
#
# Gives the power, by Order in Council, to extend wartime legislation
# to the Isle of Man.
#
# - The Summer Time Act, 1916 (6 & 7 Geo. 5. c. 14)
#
# Introduced Summer Time for the first time, in Great Britain and Ireland.
# Specified a one hour offset from GMT (DMT in Ireland), dates of
# Sunday 21 May and Sunday 1 October and times of 02:00 (GMT/DMT).
# Gave a power to make Orders in subsequent years, for the duration
# of the then current war.
#
# - The Time (Ireland) Act, 1916 (6 & 7 Geo. 5. c. 45)
#
# This abolished Dublin mean time at 02:00 DMT on Sunday 1 October 1916,
# bringing the whole of the United Kingdom onto GMT. As Ireland was behind
# GMT/BST at 02:00 DMT on 1 Oct Great Britain had already put the clocks back.
# Using Paul Eggert's suggestion of IST for Irish Summer Time and the figure
# derived from Whitman for the offset of IST from GMT (00:34:39) the sequence
# would have been:
# Dublin        London
# 02:34:38 IST  02:59:59 BST
# 02:34:39 IST  02:00:00 GMT
# 02:59:59 IST  02:25:20 GMT
# 02:25:21 GMT  02:25:21 GMT
# with the transition 03:00:00 IST -> 02:00:00 DMT -> 02:25:21 GMT all at once.
#
# - S.R.&O. 1916, No. 382
#
# An Order made under the Isle of Man (War Legislation) Act, 1914
# extending the Summer Time Act, 1916 to the Isle of Man. Dated
# 23 May 1916, two days after the start of Summer Time, but it says that
# the Act is deemed to have taken effect in the Isle of Man at the same
# time as it took effect in the United Kingdom.
#
# - S.R.&O. 1917, No. 362
#
# An Order made under the Summer Time Act, 1916 giving dates
# for Summer Time in 1917 of Sunday 8 April to Monday 17 September,
# both at 02:00 GMT. Note that Summer Time ends on a Monday.
#
# - S.R.&O. 1917, No. 358
#
# An Order made under the Summer Time (Isle of Man) Act, 1916
# (the thing created by S.R.&O. 1916, No. 382) specifying the same
# dates of 8 April to 17 September, at 02:00 GMT for the Isle of Man.
#
# - S.R.&O. 1918, No. 274
#
# An Order made under the Summer Time Act, 1916 giving dates
# for Summer Time in 1918 of Sunday 24 March to Monday 30 September,
# both at 02:00 GMT.
#
# - S.R.&O. 1918, No. 429
#
# The matching Isle of Man Order for 1918 with the same dates and times.
#
# - The Termination of the Present War (Definition) Act, 1918
#   (8 & 9 Geo. 5. c. 59)
#
# This gave power to specify a legal end date for the war just ended,
# which would affect things like the Summer Time Act, 1916, which applied
# only in wartime. This date was to be close to the date of formal
# ratification of the treaty or treaties of peace.
#
# - S.R.&O. 1919, No. 297
#
# An Order made under the Summer Time Act, 1916 giving dates
# for Summer Time in 1919 of Sunday 30 March to Monday 29 September,
# both at 02:00 GMT.
#
# - S.R.&O. 1919, No. 366
#
# The matching Isle of Man Order for 1919 with the same dates and times.
#
# - S.R.&O. 1920, No. 458
#
# An Order made under the Summer Time Act, 1916 giving dates

#
# - S.R.&O. 1920, No. 573
#
# The matching Isle of Man Order for 1920 with the same dates and times.
#
# - S.R.&O. 1920, No. 1844
#
# An Order modifying both S.R.&O. 1920, No. 458 and S.R.&O. 1920, No. 573 to
# change the end date for Summer Time from Monday 27 September to
# Monday 25 October (the time remaining 02:00 GMT). The 1989 Green
# Paper (Cm 722) says this was done because of a coal strike.
#
# - The War Emergency Laws (Continuance) Act, 1920 (10 Geo. 5. c. 5)
#
# This extends the power to make Orders under the Summer Time Act, 1916
# for a period of 12 months after the termination of the war.
# Came into force on 31 March 1920. Although the war had been over for more
# than 12 months by then the legal end date had not yet been set.
#
# - S.R.&O. 1921, No. 363
#
# An Order made under the Summer Time Act, 1916 and the War

# in 1921 of Sunday 26 March to Sunday 8 October, both at 02:00 GMT.
# It also mentions the arrangements for defining the legal end date
# for the late war. An Order was made on 10 August 1921, under the
# Termination of the Present War (Definition) Act, 1918, setting
# a date of 31 August 1921. This means the powers of the Summer Time
# Act, 1916 would finally expire on 31 August 1922.
#
# - S.R.&O. 1922, No. 290 (???)
#
# This is probably the matching Isle of Man Order.
#
# - The Summer Time Act, 1922 (12 & 13 Geo. 5. c. 22)
#
# This specifies an offset of 1 hour and dates of the day after the third
# Saturday in April, unless that be Easter, in which case it is the day after
# the second Saturday, and the day after the third Saturday in September.
# The time is 02:00 GMT. It applied in 1922 and 1923, and longer if Parliament
# so approved. It applied to the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands as well.
# Came into Force on 20 July 1920. Note the reversion to ending on a Sunday.
#
# - S.R.&O. 1922, No. 1205
#
# An Order made under the War Emergency Laws (Continuance) Act, 1920
# dated 13 October 1922. It revokes (among other things) the Order extending
# the Summer Time Act, 1916 to the Isle of Man.
#
# - The Expiring Laws Continuance Act, 1923 (13 & 14 Geo. 5. c. 37)
#
# This extended the Summer Time Act, 1922 (among other things) until
# 31 December 1924.
#
# - The Expiring Laws Continuance Act, 1924 (15 Geo. 5. c. 1) (jsm)
#
# This further extended the Summer Time Act, 1922 (among other things) until
# 31 December 1925.
#
# - The Time Act (Northern Ireland), 1924 (14 & 15 Geo. 5. c. 24 (N.I.))
#
# This Act says that while it remains in force, any Act or Order relating
# to the time for general purposes in Great Britain shall also apply
# in Northern Ireland, and the Time (Ireland) Act, 1916 shall have effect
# accordingly.
#
# - The Summer Time Act, 1925 (15 & 16 Geo. 5. c. 64)
#
# This makes the 1922 Act permanent, with a change to the end date to the
# day after the first Saturday in October. Came into force on 7 August 1925.
#
# - The Emergency Powers (Defence) Act, 1939 (2 & 3 Geo. 6. c. 62) (???)
#
# I haven't seen this one. It presumably gave the Government powers to
# do all manner of things during the newly started war.
#
# - The Defence (Summer Time) Regulations, 1939, S.R.&O. 1939, No. 1379
#
# These were made under the Emergency Powers (Defence) Act, 1939.
# They change the end date to be the day after the third Saturday in November.
#
# - S.R.&O. 1940, No. 172
#
# An Order in Council amending the Defence (Summer Time) Regulations, 1939.
# It changed the start date to the day after the fourth Saturday in February
# (ie. 25 Feb 1940).
#
# - S.R.&O. 1940, No. 1883
#
# Another Order amending the Defence (Summer Time) Regulations, 1939.
# This continues summer time throughout the year after it starts in 1940.
#
# - S.R.&O. 1941, No. 476
#
# Another Order amending the Defence (Summer Time) Regulations, 1939.
# This introduces double summer time, starting at 01:00 GMT on the day after
# the first Saturday in May and ending at 01:00 GMT on the day after the
# second Saturday in August, offset another hour from normal summer time,
# which continues throughout the rest of the year.
#
# - S.R.&O. 1942, No. 506
#
# Another Order amending the Defence (Summer Time) Regulations, 1939.
# This changes the start date of Double Summer Time to the day after the first
# Saturday in April, bringing it forward from May.
#
# - S.R.&O. 1944, No. 932
#
# Another Order amending the Defence (Summer Time) Regulations, 1939.
# This changed the end date of Double Summer Time to the day after the
# third Saturday in September (ie. 17 September 1944).
#
# - S.R.&O. 1945, No. 312
#
# Another Order amending the Defence (Summer Time) Regulations, 1939.
# This changes the start and end dates of Double Summer Time to the
# day after the first Sunday in April and the day after the second Saturday
# in July (ie. Mon 2 April to Sun 15 July).
#
# I have this quote from Hansard (the official record of the United Kingdom
# Parliament), Oral Answers, 1 March 1945, cols 1559--60, explaining the
# unusual start on a Monday:
#
#  `58. Major Sir Goronwy Owen asked the Secretary of State for the Home
#   Department if he is now able to state the Government's proposals
#   regarding double summer time.
#
#   [two other similar questions omitted]
#
#   Mr. H. Morrison: The Government, in reviewing the matter, have
#   considered, [...] the conclusion has been reached that the adoption of
#   double summer time from the beginning of April is essential to the
#   maintenance of the war effort. [...] As 1st April is Easter Sunday,
#   when very early services are held in many churches, it is proposed that
#   double summer time shall start not in the night preceding Easter
#   Sunday, but in the night of Sunday-Monday so that it will operate from
#   Monday, 2nd April.'
#
# - S.R.&O. 1945, No. 1208
#
# An Order under the Emergency Powers (Defence) Acts, 1939 and 1940 revoking
# a long list of things, including the Defence (Summer Time) Regulations, 1939.
# This meant that Summer Time reverted to being set by the 1922 and 1925 Acts.
# It was made on 28 September, early enough to end Summer Time on the
# date defined by the 1925 Act: 7 October.
#
# - The Summer Time Act, 1947 (10 & 11 Geo. 6. c. 16)
#
# Came into force on 11 March 1947. Amended the Summer Time Acts, 1922 and
# 1925 to change the dates of Summer Time and to introduce Double Summer Time
# (although it doesn't give this, or any, name for this period of 2 hour
# offset from GMT). Dates are given for 1947 only and are: 02:00 GMT Sunday
# 16 March, 01:00 GMT Sunday 13 April, 01:00 GMT Sunday 10 August, and 02:00
# Sunday 2 November. It gave a power to make Orders for subsequent years,
# both to vary the dates and to continue Double Summer Time. It applied
# to the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands.
#
# - Summer Time Order, 1948 (S.I. 1948/495)
#
# An Order made under the Summer Time Act, 1947. Gave dates for 1948 of
# 14 March and 31 October, both at 02:00 GMT.
#
# Although the 1947 Act had legislated for Double Summer Time, this was
# not continued after 1947.
#
# - Summer Time Order, 1949 (S.I. 1949/373)
#
# Another Order made under the Summer Time Act, 1947. Gave dates for 1949
# of 3 April and 30 October, both at 02:00 GMT.
#
# - Summer Time Order, 1950 (S.I. 1950/518)
#
# Another Order made under the Summer Time Act, 1947. Gave dates for 1950
# of 16 April and 22 October, both at 02:00 GMT.
#
# - Summer Time Order, 1951 (S.I. 1951/430)
#
# Another Order made under the Summer Time Act, 1947. Gave dates for 1951
# of 15 April and 21 October, both at 02:00 GMT.
#
# - Summer Time Order, 1952 (S.I. 1952/451)
#
# Another Order made under the Summer Time Act, 1947. Gave dates for 1952
# of 20 April and 26 October, both at 02:00 GMT.
#
# This is the last of this run of Orders, so for 1953 things reverted
# to the 1922 and 1925 Acts.
#
# - The Interpretation Act (Northern Ireland), 1954 (1954 c. 33 (N.I.)) (???)
#
# I presume that section 39 of this Act is similar to section 9 of the
# Interpretation Act, 1978 (listed below) in specifying GMT as the
# legal time in Northern Ireland, replacing the Time (Ireland) Act, 1916.
#
# - Summer Time Order, 1961 (S.I. 1961/71)
#
# Specified dates of 26 March and 29 October (02:00 GMT) for 1961
#
# - Summer Time (1962) Order, 1961 (S.I. 1961/2465)
#
# Specified dates of 25 March to 28 October (02:00 GMT) for 1962.
#
# - Summer Time Order, 1963 (S.I. 1963/81)
#
# Specified dates of 31 March to 27 October (02:00 GMT) for 1963.
#
# - Summer Time (1964) Order, 1963 (S.I. 1963/2101)
#
# Specified dates of 22 March to 25 October (02:00 GMT) for 1964.
#
# - Summer Time Order, 1964 (S.I. 1964/1201)
#
# Specified dates for three years (all 02:00 GMT):
#   1965: 21 March to 24 October
#   1966: 20 March to 23 October
#   1967: 19 March to 29 October
#
# - Summer Time Order, 1967 (S.I. 1967/1148)
# - Summer Time Order, 1968 (S.I. 1968/117)
#
# The first of these specifies dates for 1968 of 18 February for the United
# Kingdom but 7 April for the Isle of Man, both ending on 27 October,
# all at 02:00 GMT. The second Order changes the Isle of Man start date
# to 18 February to match the United Kingdom.
#
# - The British Standard Time Act 1968 (1968 c. 45)
#
# This came into force on 27 October 1968 and continued summer time throughout
# the year. It expired at 02:00 GMT on 31 October 1971, as specified in the
# Act, as Parliament did not move to make this experment permanent.
# It applied to the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands.
#
# Interestingly, it says baldly `This Act shall come into force on
# 27 October 1968', without giving a time. As S1 of the Act merely
# stated that `The time for general purposes in the United Kingdom
# (to be known as British standard time) shall be one hour in
# advance of Greenwich mean time throughout the year; ...' you could
# possibly argue that the start time of BStandardT was 00:00 1968-10-27,
# especially as the Act repealed the Summer Time Acts 1916--1947 in toto,
# thereby destroying the authority of the Summer Time Order specifying
# summer time in 1968.
#
# - The Manx Time Act 1968
#
# This is an Act of Tynwald (the Isle of Man Parliament) that said that
# henceforth Manx time would be the same as the time in Great Britain.
#
# - The Summer Time Act 1972 (1972 c. 6)
#
# This specified a reversion to normal Summer Time behaviour with a start
# date of the day after the third Saturday in March, unless that is Easter,
# when it is the day after the second Saturday, and an end date of the day
# after the fourth Saturday in October. Times are at 02:00 GMT, offset is
# 1 hour. It gives the power to make Orders to vary these dates and
# times. This Act is still in force and is the legal authority for
# implementing the EC Directives in the United Kingdom.
#
# - The Interpretation Act 1978 (1978 c. 30)
#
# Section 9 of this Act replaces section 1 of the Statutes (Definition of
# Time) Act, 1880 with very similar wording maintaining GMT as the legal
# time in Great Britain. This does not apply in Northern Ireland (it
# has its own Interpretation Act listed above).
#
# - Council Directive of 22 July 1980 on summertime arrangements (80/737/EEC)
#
# The first of the European Directives on Summer Time. It specified start
# dates for 1981 and 1982. No agreement had been reached on end dates.
# Only dates were given, there was no rule like `last Sunday in March'.
# The main change for the United Kingdom was a move to a 01:00 GMT change
# time. The dates:
#   1981: 29 March
#   1982: 28 March
#
# - Summer Time Order, 1980 (S.I. 1980/1089)
#
# Specified dates for 1981 and 1982, with the start dates as in the
# EC Directive and all times 01:00 GMT:
#   1981: 29 March to 25 October
#   1982: 28 March to 24 October
#
# - Second Council Directive of 10 June 1982 on summertime arrangements
#   (82/399/EEC)
#
# The next European Directive. Specified dates for three years, 1983 to 1985.
# Agreement still hadn't been reached on a common end date, and wouldn't
# be until 1994 with the appeareance of the seventh Directive with a common
# date for 1996 and beyond, but this time the Directive gave two sets of
# end dates. The start date was specified by rule: the last Sunday in March.
# All times were 01:00 GMT. The end dates were given without rule, as:
#   1983: 25 September or 23 October
#   1984: 30 September or 28 october
#   1985: 29 September or 27 October
#
# - Summer Time Order, 1982 (S.I. 1982/1673)
#
# Implemented the second EC Directive, using the October end dates.
#   1983: 27 March to 23 October
#   1984: 25 March to 28 october
#   1985: 31 March to 27 October
#
# - Third Council Directive of 12 December 1984 on summertime arrangements
#   (84/634/EEC)
#
# Specified start dates of the last Sunday in March and two sets of end
# dates, last Sunday in September and fourth Sunday in October, all at
# 01:00 GMT. The end dates were also specified as dates:
#   1986: 28 September or 26 October
#   1987: 27 September or 25 October
#   1988: 25 September or 23 October
#
# - Summer Time Order, 1986 (S.I. 1986/223)
#
# Implemented the third EC Directive, using the October end dates.
#   1986: 30 March to 26 October
#   1987: 29 March to 25 October
#   1988: 27 March to 23 October
#
# - Council Directive of 20 December 1985 amending Directive 84/634/EEC
#   on summertime arrangements (85/582/EEC)
#
# This was to do with the accession of Spain and Portugal to the EEC.
# The previous directve had used wording like `Member States belonging
# to the zero (Greenwich) time zone' when refering to the different
# sets of end dates. Portugal was in that time zone but was not going
# to follow the United Kingdom and Ireland dates, so the text was reworded
# without any change to the dates themselves.
#
# - Fourth Council Directive of 22 December 1987 on summertime arrangements
#   (88/14/EEC)
#
# This Directive covered only a single year: 1989. My guess is that
# this was because 1989 was one of the years when the historic United Kingdom
# end date of the Sunday after the fourth Saturday in October differed from
# the rule in the previous Directive of the fourth Sunday in October.
# All times are 01:00 GMT. No rule was specified, specific dates were given:
#   1989: 26 March to 24 September or 29 October
#
# - Summer Time Order, 1988 (S.I. 1988/931)
#
# Implemented the dates of 26 March to 29 October for 1989.
#
# - Fifth Council Directive of 21 December 1988 on summertime arrangements
#   (89/47/EEC)
#
# Covered the three years 1990 to 1992. All times are 01:00 GMT. Gave both
# rules (last Sunday in March, last Sunday in September or fourth Sunday
# in October) and specific dates:
#   1990: 25 March to 30 September or 28 October
#   1991: 31 March to 29 September or 27 October
#   1992: 29 March to 27 September or 25 October
#
# - Summer Time Order, 1989 (S.I. 1989/985)
#
# Implemented the fifth Directive using the October end dates.
#
# - Sixth Council Directive 92/20/EEC of 26 March 1992 on summertime
#   arrangements
#
# Covered the two years 1993 and 1994. All times are 01:00 GMT. Specified

#   1993: 28 March to 26 September or 24 October
#   1994: 27 March to 25 September or 23 October
#
# - Summer Time Order, 1992 (S.I. 1992/1729)
#
# Implemented the sixth Directive using the October end dates.

# - Seventh Directive 94/21/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council

# The rules were the same last Sunday in March to last Sunday in September
# or fourth Sunday in October for 1995, with the end rule changing to the
# last Sunday in October for 1996 and 1997. The year 1995 was another of
# the tricky ones where the EC and traditional United Kingdom rules differed
# but this time the UK changed on the fourth Sunday, 22 October, earlier

# on the subject.
#
# - Eighth Directive 97/44/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council
#   of 22 July 1997 on summer-time arrangements
#
# Covers four years: 1998 to 2001. All times are 01:00 GMT. Specifies both

# Subject: Re: Gregorian reform -- a part of locale?
# </a>
# Date: 1996-07-06
#
# In 1700, Denmark made the transition from Julian to Gregorian.  Sweden
# decided to *start* a transition in 1700 as well, but rather than have one of
# those unsightly calendar gaps :-), they simply decreed that the next leap
# year after 1696 would be in 1744 -- putting the whole country on a calendar
# different from both Julian and Gregorian for a period of 40 years.
#
# However, in 1704 something went wrong and the plan was not carried through;
# they did, after all, have a leap year that year.  And one in 1708.  In 1712
# they gave it up and went back to Julian, putting 30 days in February that
# year!...
#
# Then in 1753, Sweden made the transition to Gregorian in the usual manner,
# getting there only 13 years behind the original schedule.
#
# (A previous posting of this story was challenged, and Swedish readers
# produced the following references to support it: "Tiderakning och historia"
# by Natanael Beckman (1924) and "Tid, en bok om tiderakning och
# kalendervasen" by Lars-Olof Lode'n (no date was given).)

# From Peter Ilieve <peter@@memex.co.uk> (1993-09-03):
#
# Our Government...couldn't...make a decision after the 1989 consultation
# exercise about the UK changing its timezone so it just let things drift
# (different from deciding to keep the status quo).  According to the
# Summer Time Order 1992 (SI 1992/1729) the dates of Summer Time for 1993
# and 1994 are:
#	Start		End
# 1993	28 March	24 October
# 1994	27 March	23 October
# All start and end times are at 01:00 GMT.
#
# There [was] an error in your tables for the start and end times prior to 1981.
# The UK always used to change at 02:00 GMT. In 1981 it changed to 01:00 GMT
# as a part of EC harmonisation and has remained at that time since.
#
# I have found the default algorithm for UK Summer Time, it is in the
# Summer Time Act 1972. Section 1 states that in the absence of an Order
# in Council Summer Time starts at 02:00 GMT on the morning of the day
# after the third Saturday in March, unless that day is Easter Day, in
# which case it is the morning of the day after the second Saturday.
# It ends at 02:00 GMT on the morning of the day after the fourth Saturday
# in October. (All the redundant `morning of the day ...' is in the Act.)
# This is only of passing interest now as it will always be overridden by
# an Order in Council (a Statutory Instrument, the SI thing mentioned above)
# to specify the EC specified dates.

# From Peter Ilieve <peter@@memex.co.uk> (1993-10-18):
#
# My contact in the Ministry of Defence Public Relations department
# accepted the challenge of looking into this and produced the following,
# from Hansard (the official record of the UK Parliament), Oral Answers,
# 1 March 1945, cols 1559--60:
#
# `58. Major Sir Goronwy Owen asked the Secretary of State for the Home
# Department if he is now able to state the Government's proposals
# regarding double summer time.
#
# [two other similar questions omitted]
#
# Mr. H. Morrison: The Government, in reviewing the matter, have
# considered, [...] the conclusion has been reached that the adoption of
# double summer time from the beginning of April is essential to the
# maintenance of the war effort. [...] As 1st April is Easter Sunday,
# when very early services are held in many churches, it is proposed that
# double summer time shall start not in the night preceding Easter
# Sunday, but in the night of Sunday- Monday so that it will operate from
# Monday, 2nd April.'

#
# The ending rule here doesn't match the EC rules, which specify the fourth
# Sunday in October for the UK and Eire. The `fourth Sunday' rule wasn't
# followed in 1989, but then the sixth EC directive wasn't in force then
# and I don't know what previous ones said. 1995 is the next year with
# the 4th Sun on 22 Oct, but that year isn't covered by the UK Summer Time
# Order or the sixth EC directive. Your Oct Sun>=23 rule matches history
# and with things only announced for 2 years or so in advance who knows
# what will happen.
#
# There are renewed rumours that the Government here will make another
# attempt at resolving this issue, which is what prompted me to start
# asking the Home Office and the EC about it again. The EC categorically
# state they are not asking anybody to change timezone, they only want
# common start/end dates. The UK Govt. seem to want to change our zone
# and blame the resulting fuss on the EC. Me, I think we should scrap
# summer time completely, noon is when the Sun is overhead, and that should
# be the end of it.

# From Peter Ilieve <peter@@memex.co.uk> (1993-10-22):
#
# I now have the text of the Summer Time Act 1916, the granddaddy of them all.
# It is headed: `An Act to provide for the Time in Great Britain and Ireland
# being in advance of Greenwich and Dublin mean time respectively in the
# summer months'.
#
# It specifies 21 May and 1 October for 1916 (both at 02:00 GMT) and whatever
# dates an Order in Council may specify for subsequent years.
#
# Section 4 states: `This act shall apply to Ireland in like manner as it
# applies to Great Britain, with the substitution however of references
# to Dublin mean time for references to Greenwich mean time.'
#
# Lorna, my learned legal friend who supplied it, also offers this quote
# from Halsbury's Statutes on the extent of Acts:
#
# `An Act of the United Kingdom Parliament is to be construed prima facie
# to apply to the whole of the United Kingdom and not to any place outside.
# [...] The expression "United Kingdom" for this purpose includes (since
# 1922) Great Britain (ie. England, Wales and Scotland) and Northern Ireland,
# but it does not include the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man.'
#
# She goes on to say the seminal event of 1922 was the establishment of
# the Irish Free State, now called Eire.
#
# The Act doesn't say anything about Wales (or Scotland) so I would assert
# that Shanks is wrong here. I would like to know why he thinks Wales
# was different.
#
# It also confirms the fact that Ireland followed Dublin time back then,
# and 25 minutes behind Greenwich, as Shanks has it, would be correct.

# From Peter Ilieve <peter@@memex.co.uk> (1993-10-28):
#
# I now have before me, thanks to my learned legal friend Lorna, the text of
# the Time (Ireland) Act 1916.
#
# It says that as from 2 AM Dublin Mean Time on 1 October 1916 the time
# for general purposes in Ireland shall be the same as the rest of Great
# Britain (ie. GMT with the Summer Time periods specified by the Summer Time
# Act 1916)....  As Ireland was behind GMT/BST at 02:00 DMT on 1 Oct GB would
# have already put the clocks back. Using DST as Dublin Summer Time the
# sequence would have been:
# Dublin		London
# 02:34 DST	02:59 BST
# 02:35 DST	02:00 GMT
# 02:59 DST	02:24 GMT
# 02:25 GMT	02:25 GMT
# with the transition 03:00 DST -> 02:00 DMT -> 02:25 GMT all at once.
#
# In a table of repeals in the Schedule to the Act it mentions the
# Statutes (Definition of Time) Act 1880. This is presumably the source
# of the 1880 date in Shanks.  The little bit of it that is repealed
# also refers solely to Ireland and Dublin Mean Time.

# From Peter Ilieve <peter@@memex.co.uk> (1993-10-29):
#
# My case is that, with the sole exception of Ireland in 1916 using Dublin
# Mean Time, Summer Time has been uniform throughout the United Kingdom
# ever since it first started in 1916.
#
# The United Kingdom is England, Wales and Scotland plus all of Ireland from
# 1916 up to and including 1921, or plus Northern Ireland from 1922 to date.
#
# The dates used are those specified in the table in Summer Time: A Consultation
# Document (Cm 722, 1989) that are now included in the europe file, with a
# change to a single date, the start in 1924. I made a typo in my 1989 mail
# and the table itself is also wrong.  The correct date is 13 April.
# The times were 02:00 GMT up to and including 1980, 01:00 GMT from 1981 on,
# except for wartime double summer time.
#
# As evidence I would cite:
#
# - The Summer Time Act, 1916.
#
# This specifically states that it applies to Ireland, specifies dates of
# 21 May and 1 October and times of 02:00, and says that in Ireland the
# times relate to Dublin mean time. It specifies an offset of 1 hour.
#
# - The Time (Ireland) Act, 1916
#
# This abolishes Dublin mean time on 02:00 DMT 1 October 1916.
# It repeals that section of the Statutes (Definition of Time) Act, 1880
# that specifies DMT. It is therefore a safe bet that DMT existed at least
# from 1880 and was the only alternative standard time in the UK.

# Here is a revised version of my tabrules file for the perl script I sent
# before. I have personally verified the various Orders back to 1953 and
# all the Acts.
#
# There are no changes to the dates we already have.
#
# My doubt about an early start in 1967 on 18 Feb was misplaced, the Order
# does say 18 Feb. This is an interesting case as the first Order gave a
# different date of 7 April 1967 for the Isle of Man but this was changed
# before it came into effect by another Order for the Isle of Man alone.
#
# I don't think I will be able to find any more of the earlier Orders.
# The annual volumes for 1949--52 do not contain the various Summer Time
# Orders. They therefore don't appear in the index. They rate a mention in
# italics in the numerical list at the start but that is all.
# I think what happens is that the annual volume is produced well after the
# end of the year in question, by which time the Summer Time Order is spent.
# They assume that nobody would ever be stupid enough to want to see it
# again so they leave it out.
#
# It might be a good idea to put this table, or the output of tabscript
# showing all the moves because of Easter, in the europe file comments in

# The major changes from existing practice are that 1995 will be the last year
# that the UK and Eire finish on a different date from everyone else,
# and the common end date from 1996 onwards will be the last Sunday in October.
# Year	 Start		End		End (UK & Eire, 1995 only)

# 1995	26 March	24 September	22 October
# 1996	31 March	27 October

#
# From Peter Ilieve <peter@@memex.co.uk> (1994-12-01):
# The final piece of the legislative jigsaw for summer time in the UK for
# 1995-97 is now in place.  The Summer Time Order 1994 (SI 1994/2798)
# came into force on 16 November.  It restates the dates from the EC
# seventh Summer Time Directive....
#
# From Peter Ilieve <peter@@aldie.co.uk> (1996-04-20):
# Proposals for the eighth directive were supposed to have been produced
# by the Commission by 1 Jan 96. They have not yet appeared (I asked just
# before Easter).

# From Peter Ilieve <peter@@memex.co.uk> (1994-03-28):
# The [GB-Eire] end date of 22 October [1995] conflicts with your current rule
# of Oct Sun>=23, and the historical UK formula of Sun after 4th Sat.
# The last time 4th Sun and Sun after 4th Sat differed was in 1989,
# when 29 October was used.  That year was covered by a UK Summer Time Order
# for only a single year and it looks as though there was a matching 4th EC
# directive for just this year.  I don't have the text of the 5th EC
# directive (for 1990--92) but my guess would be it said 4th Sun.
# To maintain strict historical accuracy you could start a new UK ending rule
# of Oct Sun>=22 in 1990.

# Date: Fri, 3 Sep 93 13:43:41 BST
# From: Peter Ilieve <peter@@memex.co.uk>
# ...
# Turning to Europe, I now have a copy of the `Sixth Council Directive 92/20/EEC
# of 26 March 1992 on summertime arrangements'. This only covers 1993 and
# 1994, a seventh one is in the works but I doubt that the algorithm will
# change. This says summertime starts at 01:00 GMT on the last Sunday in March
# and ends at 01:00 GMT on the last Sunday in September, except for the UK
# and Eire where it ends at 01:00 GMT on the fourth Sunday in October.
# It says the arrangements for 1995 onwards will be decided by 1 January 1994,
# but as the sixth directive was supposed to appear by 1 Jan 92 and didn't
# arrive til March I wouldn't hold your breath.
#
# The first summertime directive was adopted in 1980, although the UK didn't
# seem to use it until 1981. I suspect it would be safe to move your start
# dates for the -Eur rules back to 1981.

# From Paul Eggert <eggert@@twinsun.com> (May 28, 1994):
# Moscow and Novosibirsk time zone names, and Moscow rules after 1991,
# are from Andrew A. Chernov <ache@@astral.msk.su>.
# I invented the other time zone names, and (unless otherwise specified)
# guessed what happened after 1991; the clocks were chaotic, and we know little.
# The rest is from Shanks.
#
# From Shanks (1991):
# Western Russia switched from the Julian to the Gregorian calendar
# on 1918 Jan 14.  Eastern Russia switched on 1920 Mar 18.
# In 1929 the Soviet Union instituted a 5 day week; in 1932 it instituted
# a 6 day week; on 1940 Jun 27 it returned to the Gregorian week.
