@# $OpenBSD: africa,v 1.51 2017/02/28 23:19:42 millert Exp $
# This file is in the public domain, so clarified as of
# 2009-05-17 by Arthur David Olson.

# This file is by no means authoritative; if you think you know better,
# go ahead and edit the file (and please send any changes to
# tz@@iana.org for general use in the future).  For more, please see
# the file CONTRIBUTING in the tz distribution.

# From Paul Eggert (2017-02-20):
#
# Unless otherwise specified, the source for data through 1990 is:
# Thomas G. Shanks and Rique Pottenger, The International Atlas (6th edition),
# San Diego: ACS Publications, Inc. (2003).
# Unfortunately this book contains many errors and cites no sources.
#
# Many years ago Gwillim Law wrote that a good source
# for time zone data was the International Air Transport
# Association's Standard Schedules Information Manual (IATA SSIM),
# published semiannually.  Law sent in several helpful summaries
# of the IATA's data after 1990.  Except where otherwise noted,
# IATA SSIM is the source for entries after 1990.
#
# Another source occasionally used is Edward W. Whitman, World Time Differences,
# Whitman Publishing Co, 2 Niagara Av, Ealing, London (undated), which
# I found in the UCLA library.
#
# For data circa 1899, a common source is:
# Milne J. Civil time. Geogr J. 1899 Feb;13(2):173-94.
# http://www.jstor.org/stable/1774359
#
# A reliable and entertaining source about time zones is
# Derek Howse, Greenwich time and longitude, Philip Wilson Publishers (1997).
#
# European-style abbreviations are commonly used along the Mediterranean.
# For sub-Saharan Africa abbreviations were less standardized.
# Previous editions of this database used WAT, CAT, SAT, and EAT
# for UT +00 through +03, respectively,
# but in 1997 Mark R V Murray reported that
# 'SAST' is the official abbreviation for +02 in the country of South Africa,
# 'CAT' is commonly used for +02 in countries north of South Africa, and
# 'WAT' is probably the best name for +01, as the common phrase for
# the area that includes Nigeria is "West Africa".
#
# To summarize, the following abbreviations seemed to have some currency:
#	 +00	GMT	Greenwich Mean Time
#	 +02	CAT	Central Africa Time
#	 +02	SAST	South Africa Standard Time
# and Murray suggested the following abbreviation:
#	 +01	WAT	West Africa Time
# Murray's suggestion seems to have caught on in news reports and the like.
# I vaguely recall 'WAT' also being used for -01 in the past but
# cannot now come up with solid citations.
#
# I invented the following abbreviations; corrections are welcome!
#	 +02	WAST	West Africa Summer Time
#	 +03	CAST	Central Africa Summer Time (no longer used)
#	 +03	SAST	South Africa Summer Time (no longer used)
#	 +03	EAT	East Africa Time
# 'EAT' also seems to have caught on; the others are rare but are paired
# with better-attested non-DST abbreviations.

# Egypt was mean noon at the Great Pyramid, 2:04:30.5, but apparently this

# From Abdelrahman Hassan (2007-09-06):
# Due to the Hijri (lunar Islamic calendar) year being 11 days shorter
# than the year of the Gregorian calendar, Ramadan shifts earlier each
# year. This year it will be observed September 13 (September is quite
# hot in Egypt), and the idea is to make fasting easier for workers by
# shifting business hours one hour out of daytime heat. Consequently,
# unless discontinued, next DST may end Thursday 28 August 2008.
# From Paul Eggert (2007-08-17):
# For lack of better info, assume the new rule is last Thursday in August.

# It seems that Mauritius observed daylight saving time from 1982-10-10 to

# From Arthur David Olson (2008-06-30):
# The www.timeanddate.com article cited by Steffen Thorsen notes that "A
# final decision has yet to be made on the times that daylight saving
# would begin and end on these dates." As a place holder, use midnight.

# From Paul Eggert (2008-06-30):
# Follow Thorsen on DST in 1982/1983, instead of Shanks & Pottenger.

# From Steffen Thorsen (2008-07-10):
# According to
# http://www.lexpress.mu/display_article.php?news_id=111216
# (in French), Mauritius will start and end their DST a few days earlier
# than previously announced (2008-11-01 to 2009-03-31).  The new start
# date is 2008-10-26 at 02:00 and the new end date is 2009-03-27 (no time
# given, but it is probably at either 2 or 3 wall clock time).
#
# A little strange though, since the article says that they moved the date
# to align itself with Europe and USA which also change time on that date,
# but that means they have not paid attention to what happened in
# USA/Canada last year (DST ends first Sunday in November). I also wonder
# why that they end on a Friday, instead of aligning with Europe which
# changes two days later.

# From Alex Krivenyshev (2008-07-11):
# Seems that English language article "The revival of daylight saving
# time: Energy conservation?"- No. 16578 (07/11/2008) was originally
# published on Monday, June 30, 2008...
#
# I guess that article in French "Le gouvernement avance l'introduction
# de l'heure d'été" stating that DST in Mauritius starting on October 26
# and ending on March 27, 2009 is the most recent one....

# From Petr Machata (2011-03-30):
# They have it written in English here:
# http://www.map.ma/eng/sections/home/morocco_to_spring_fo/view
#
# It says there that "Morocco will resume its standard time on July 31,
# 2011 at midnight." Now they don't say whether they mean midnight of
# wall clock time (i.e. 11pm UTC), but that's what I would assume. It has
# also been like that in the past.

# From Alexander Krivenyshev (2012-03-09):
# According to Infomédiaire web site from Morocco (infomediaire.ma),
# on March 9, 2012, (in French) Heure légale:
# Le Maroc adopte officiellement l'heure d'été
# http://www.infomediaire.ma/news/maroc/heure-l%C3%A9gale-le-maroc-adopte-officiellement-lheure-d%C3%A9t%C3%A9
# Governing Council adopted draft decree, that Morocco DST starts on
# the last Sunday of March (March 25, 2012) and ends on
# last Sunday of September (September 30, 2012)
# except the month of Ramadan.
# or (brief)
# http://www.worldtimezone.com/dst_news/dst_news_morocco06.html

# From Arthur David Olson (2012-03-10):
# The infomediaire.ma source indicates that the system is to be in
# effect every year. It gives 03H00 as the "fall back" time of day;
# it lacks a "spring forward" time of day; assume 2:00 XXX.
# Wait on specifying the Ramadan exception for details about
# start date, start time of day, end date, and end time of day XXX.

# From Christophe Tropamer (2012-03-16):
# Seen Morocco change again:
# http://www.le2uminutes.com/actualite.php
# "...à partir du dernier dimanche d'avril et non fins mars,
# comme annoncé précédemment."

# From Milamber Space Network (2012-07-17):
# The official return to GMT is announced by the Moroccan government:
# http://www.mmsp.gov.ma/fr/actualites.aspx?id=288 [in French]
#
# Google translation, lightly edited:
# Back to the standard time of the Kingdom (GMT)
# Pursuant to Decree No. 2-12-126 issued on 26 Jumada (I) 1433 (April 18,
# 2012) and in accordance with the order of Mr. President of the
# Government No. 3-47-12 issued on 24 Sha'ban (11 July 2012), the Ministry
# of Public Service and Administration Modernization announces the return
# of the legal time of the Kingdom (GMT) from Friday, July 20, 2012 until
# Monday, August 20, 2012.  So the time will be delayed by 60 minutes from
# 3:00 am Friday, July 20, 2012 and will again be advanced by 60 minutes
# August 20, 2012 from 2:00 am.

# From Paul Eggert (2013-03-06):
# Morocco's daylight-saving transitions due to Ramadan seem to be
# announced a bit in advance.  On 2012-07-11 the Moroccan government
# announced that year's Ramadan daylight-saving transitions would be
# 2012-07-20 and 2012-08-20; see
# http://www.mmsp.gov.ma/fr/actualites.aspx?id=288

# From Andrew Paprocki (2013-07-02):
# Morocco announced that the year's Ramadan daylight-savings
# transitions would be 2013-07-07 and 2013-08-10; see:
# http://www.maroc.ma/en/news/morocco-suspends-daylight-saving-time-july-7-aug10

# From Steffen Thorsen (2013-09-28):
# Morocco extends DST by one month, on very short notice, just 1 day
# before it was going to end.  There is a new decree (2.13.781) for
# this, where DST from now on goes from last Sunday of March at 02:00
# to last Sunday of October at 03:00, similar to EU rules.  Official
# source (French):
# http://www.maroc.gov.ma/fr/actualites/lhoraire-dete-gmt1-maintenu-jusquau-27-octobre-2013
# Another source (specifying the time for start and end in the decree):

# http://www.afriquinfos.com/articles/2014/3/18/maroc-heure-dete-avancez-tous-horloges-247891.asp

# From Milamber Space Network (2014-06-05):
# The Moroccan government has recently announced that the country will return
# to standard time at 03:00 on Saturday, June 28, 2014 local time....  DST
# will resume again at 02:00 on Saturday, August 2, 2014....
# http://www.mmsp.gov.ma/fr/actualites.aspx?id=586

# From Milamber (2015-06-08):
# (Google Translation) The hour will thus be delayed 60 minutes
# Sunday, June 14 at 3:00, the ministry said in a statement, adding
# that the time will be advanced again 60 minutes Sunday, July 19,
# 2015 at 2:00.  The move comes under 2.12.126 Decree of 26 Jumada I
# 1433 (18 April 2012) and the decision of the Head of Government of
# 16 N. 3-29-15 Chaaban 1435 (4 June 2015).

#
# From Michael Deckers (2015-06-09):
# [The gov.ma announcement] would (probably) make the switch on 2015-07-19 go
# from 03:00 to 04:00 rather than from 02:00 to 03:00, as in the patch....
# I think the patch is correct and the quoted text is wrong; the text in
# <http://lnt.ma/le-maroc-reculera-dune-heure-le-dimanche-14-juin/> agrees
# with the patch.

# From Paul Eggert (2015-06-08):
# For now, guess that later spring and fall transitions will use 2015's rules,
# and guess that Morocco will switch to standard time at 03:00 the last
# Sunday before Ramadan, and back to DST at 02:00 the first Sunday after
# Ramadan.  To implement this, transition dates for 2016 through 2037 were
# determined by running the following program under GNU Emacs 24.3, with the
# results integrated by hand into the table below.
# (let ((islamic-year 1437))
#   (require 'cal-islam)
#   (while (< islamic-year 1460)
#     (let ((a (calendar-islamic-to-absolute (list 9 1 islamic-year)))

# From Arthur David Olson (2009-03-18):
# The Tunis Afrique Presse News Agency notice contains this: "This measure is
# due to the fact that the fasting month of Ramadan coincides with the period
# concerned by summer time.  Therefore, the standard time will be kept
# unchanged the whole year long."  So foregoing DST seems to be an exception
# (albeit one that may be repeated in the future).

# From Alexander Krivenyshev (2010-03-27):
# According to some news reports Tunis confirmed not to use DST in 2010
#
# (translation):
# "The Tunisian government has decided to abandon DST, which was scheduled on
# Sunday...
# Tunisian authorities had suspended the DST for the first time last year also
# coincided with the month of Ramadan..."

# He has heard of "Western Sahara Time" for +0:00 but can find no reference.
d45 9

# To make things confusing, 'WAT' seems to have been used for -1:00 long ago;
# I'd guess that this was because people needed _some_ name for -1:00,
# and at the time, far west Africa was the only major land area in -1:00.
# This usage is now obsolete, as the last use of -1:00 on the African
# mainland seems to have been 1976 in Western Sahara.
#
# To summarize, the following abbreviations seem to have some currency:
#	-1:00	WAT	West Africa Time (no longer used)
#	 0:00	GMT	Greenwich Mean Time
#	 2:00	CAT	Central Africa Time
#	 2:00	SAST	South Africa Standard Time
# and Murray suggests the following abbreviation:
#	 1:00	WAT	West Africa Time
# I realize that this leads to 'WAT' being used for both -1:00 and 1:00
# for times before 1976, but this is the best I can think of

# ... EgyptAir seems to have assumed DST to start in April (like it previously
# did in 2010), and therefore this obviously causes problems with the schedules:

# For now, guess fall transitions will be October's last Thursday at

# From Paul Eggert (2014-07-31):
# Like the Swahili of Kenya and Tanzania, many Ethiopians keep a
# 12-hour clock starting at our 06:00, so their "8 o'clock" is our
# 02:00 or 14:00.  Keep this in mind when you ask the time in Amharic.
#
# Shanks & Pottenger write that Ethiopia had six narrowly-spaced time
# zones between 1870 and 1890, that they merged to 38E50 (2:35:20) in
# 1890, and that they switched to 3:00 on 1936-05-05.  Perhaps 38E50
# was for Adis Dera.  Quite likely the Shanks data entries are wrong

# From Paul Eggert (2014-03-19):
# To estimate what the Moroccan government will do in future years,
# transition dates for 2014 through 2038 were determined by running
# the following program under GNU Emacs 24.3:
#
# (let ((islamic-year 1435))
#   (while (< islamic-year 1461)
#     (let ((a
#	     (calendar-gregorian-from-absolute
#	      (calendar-islamic-to-absolute (list 9 1 islamic-year))))
#	    (b
#	     (calendar-gregorian-from-absolute
#	      (calendar-islamic-to-absolute (list 10 1 islamic-year)))))
#	(insert
#	 (format
#	  (concat "Rule\tMorocco\t%d\tonly\t-\t%s\t %2d\t 3:00\t0\t-\n"
#		  "Rule\tMorocco\t%d\tonly\t-\t%s\t %2d\t 2:00\t1:00\tS\n")
#	  (car (cdr (cdr a))) (calendar-month-name (car a) t) (car (cdr a))
#	  (car (cdr (cdr b))) (calendar-month-name (car b) t) (car (cdr b)))))
a884 13
#
# with spring-forward transitions removed for 2023-2025, when the
# normal spring-forward date falls during the estimated Ramadan; with
# all transitions removed for 2026-2035, where the estimated Ramadan
# falls entirely outside daylight-saving time; and with fall-back
# transitions removed for 2036-2037, where the normal fall-back
# date falls during the estimated Ramadan.  Normally, the table would
# stop after 2037 because 32-bit time_t values roll around early in 2038,
# but that would imply a prediction of perpetual DST after March 2038
# due to the year-2037 glitches.  So, this table instead stops after
# 2038, the first non-glitchy year after the 32-bit rollover.
# An advantage of stopping after 2038 is that it lets zic guess
# TZ='WET0WEST,M3.5.0,M10.5.0/3' for time stamps far in the future.

# I added so many Zone names that the old, mostly flat name space was unwieldy.
# So I renamed the Zones to have the form AREA/LOCATION, where
# AREA is the name of a continent or ocean, and
# LOCATION is the name of a specific location within that region.
# For example, the old zone name `Egypt' is now `Africa/Cairo'.
#
# Here are the general rules I used for choosing location names,
# in decreasing order of importance:
#
#	Use only valid Posix file names.  Use only Ascii letters, digits, `.',
#		`-' and `_'.  Do not exceed 14 characters or start with `-'.
#		E.g. prefer `Brunei' to `Bandar_Seri_Begawan'.
#	Include at least one location per time zone rule set per country.
#		One such location is enough.
#	If all the clocks in a country's region have agreed since 1970,
#		don't bother to include more than one location
#		even if subregions' clocks disagreed before 1970.
#		Otherwise these tables would become annoyingly large.
#	If a name is ambiguous, use a less ambiguous alternative;
#		e.g. many cities are named San Jose and Georgetown, so
#		prefer `Costa_Rica' to `San_Jose' and `Guyana' to `Georgetown'.
#	Keep locations compact.  Use cities or small islands, not countries
#		or regions, so that any future time zone changes do not split
#		locations into different time zones.  E.g. prefer `Paris'
#		to `France', since France has had multiple time zones.
#	Use traditional English spelling, e.g. prefer `Rome' to `Roma', and
#		prefer `Athens' to the true name (which uses Greek letters).
#		The Posix file name restrictions encourage this rule.
#	Use the most populous among locations in a country's time zone,
#		e.g. prefer `Shanghai' to `Beijing'.  Among locations with
#		similar populations, pick the best-known location,
#		e.g. prefer `Rome' to `Milan'.
#	Use the singular form, e.g. prefer `Canary' to `Canaries'.
#	Omit common suffixes like `_Islands' and `_City', unless that
#		would lead to ambiguity.  E.g. prefer `Cayman' to
#		`Cayman_Islands' and `Guatemala' to `Guatemala_City',
#		but prefer `Mexico_City' to `Mexico' because the country
#		of Mexico has several time zones.
#	Use `_' to represent a space.
#	Omit `.' from abbreviations in names, e.g. prefer `St_Helena'
#		to `St._Helena'.
#
# For time zone abbreviations like `EST' I used the following rules,
# in decreasing order of importance:
#
#	Use abbreviations that consist of 3 or more upper-case Ascii letters,
#		except use "___" for locations while uninhabited.
#		Posix.1 requires at least 3 characters, and the restriction to
#		upper-case Ascii letters follows most traditions.
#		Previous editions of this database also used characters like
#		' ' and '?', but these characters have a special meaning to
#		the shell and cause commands like
#			set `date`
#		to have unexpected effects.  In theory, the character set could
#		be !%./@@A-Z^_a-z{}, but these tables use only upper-case
#		Ascii letters (and "___").
#	Use abbreviations that are in common use among English-speakers,
#		e.g. `EST' for Eastern Standard Time in North America.
#		We assume that applications translate them to other languages
#		as part of the normal localization process; for example,
#		a French application might translate `EST' to `HNE'.
#	For zones whose times are taken from a city's longitude, use the
#		traditional xMT notation, e.g. `PMT' for Paris Mean Time.
#		The only name like this in current use is `GMT'.
#	If there is no common English abbreviation, abbreviate the English
#		translation of the usual phrase used by native speakers.
#		If this is not available or is a phrase mentioning the country
#		(e.g. ``Cape Verde Time''), then:
#
#		When a country has a single or principal time zone region,
#			append `T' to the country's ISO	code, e.g. `CVT' for
#			Cape Verde Time.  For summer time append `ST';
#			for double summer time append `DST'; etc.
#		When a country has multiple time zones, take the first three
#			letters of an English place name identifying each zone
#			and then append `T', `ST', etc. as before;
#			e.g. `MOSST' for MOScow Summer Time.
#
#
# For Africa I invented the following time zone abbreviations.
#		LMT	Local Mean Time
#	-1:00	AAT	Atlantic Africa Time (no longer used)
#	 0:00	WAT	West Africa Time
#	 1:00	CAT	Central Africa Time
#	 2:00	SAT	South Africa Time
d63 1
a63 3
# The final `T' is replaced by `ST' for summer time, e.g. `SAST'.
# BEAT is British East Africa Time, which was 2:30 before 1948 and 2:45 after.
