# From Paul Eggert (1999-03-22):
# A reliable and entertaining source about time zones is
# Derek Howse, Greenwich time and longitude, Philip Wilson Publishers (1997).

###############################################################################

# United States

# From Paul Eggert (1999-03-31):
# Howse writes (pp 121-125) that time zones were invented by
# Professor Charles Ferdinand Dowd (1825-1904),
# Principal of Temple Grove Ladies' Seminary (Saratoga Springs, NY).
# His pamphlet "A System of National Time for Railroads" (1870)
# was the result of his proposals at the Convention of Railroad Trunk Lines
# in New York City (1869-10).  His 1870 proposal was based on Washington, DC,
# but in 1872-05 he moved the proposed origin to Greenwich.

# From Paul Eggert (2016-09-21):
# Dowd's proposal left many details unresolved, such as where to draw
# lines between time zones.  The key individual who made time zones
# work in the US was William Frederick Allen - railway engineer,
# managing editor of the Travelers' Guide, and secretary of the
# General Time Convention, a railway standardization group.  Allen
# spent months in dialogs with scientific and railway leaders,
# developed a workable plan to institute time zones, and presented it
# to the General Time Convention on 1883-04-11, saying that his plan
# meant "local time would be practically abolished" - a plus for
# railway scheduling.  By the next convention on 1883-10-11 nearly all
# railroads had agreed and it took effect on 1883-11-18 at 12:00.
# That Sunday was called the "day of two noons", as the eastern parts
# of the new zones observed noon twice.  Allen witnessed the
# transition in New York City, writing:
#
#   I heard the bells of St. Paul's strike on the old time.  Four
#   minutes later, obedient to the electrical signal from the Naval
#   Observatory ... the time-ball made its rapid descent, the chimes
#   of old Trinity rang twelve measured strokes, and local time was
#   abandoned, probably forever.
#
# Most of the US soon followed suit.  See:
# Bartky IR. The adoption of standard time. Technol Cult 1989 Jan;30(1):25-56.
# http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3105430

# From Paul Eggert (2005-04-16):
# That 1883 transition occurred at 12:00 new time, not at 12:00 old time.
# See p 46 of David Prerau, Seize the daylight, Thunder's Mouth Press (2005).

# From Paul Eggert (2006-03-22):
# A good source for time zone historical data in the US is
# Thomas G. Shanks, The American Atlas (5th edition),
# San Diego: ACS Publications, Inc. (1991).
# Make sure you have the errata sheet; the book is somewhat useless without it.
# It is the source for most of the pre-1991 US entries below.

# From Paul Eggert (2001-03-06):
# Daylight Saving Time was first suggested as a joke by Benjamin Franklin
# in his whimsical essay "An Economical Project for Diminishing the Cost
# of Light" published in the Journal de Paris (1784-04-26).
# Not everyone is happy with the results:
#
#	I don't really care how time is reckoned so long as there is some
#	agreement about it, but I object to being told that I am saving
#	daylight when my reason tells me that I am doing nothing of the kind.
#	I even object to the implication that I am wasting something
#	valuable if I stay in bed after the sun has risen.  As an admirer
#	of moonlight I resent the bossy insistence of those who want to
#	reduce my time for enjoying it.  At the back of the Daylight Saving
#	scheme I detect the bony, blue-fingered hand of Puritanism, eager
#	to push people into bed earlier, and get them up earlier, to make
#	them healthy, wealthy and wise in spite of themselves.
#
#	 -- Robertson Davies, The diary of Samuel Marchbanks,
#	   Clarke, Irwin (1947), XIX, Sunday
#
# For more about the first ten years of DST in the United States, see
# Robert Garland, Ten years of daylight saving from the Pittsburgh standpoint
# (Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh, 1927).
# http://www.clpgh.org/exhibit/dst.html
#
# Shanks says that DST was called "War Time" in the US in 1918 and 1919.
# However, DST was imposed by the Standard Time Act of 1918, which
# was the first nationwide legal time standard, and apparently
# time was just called "Standard Time" or "Daylight Saving Time".

# From Arthur David Olson:
# US Daylight Saving Time ended on the last Sunday of *October* in 1974.
# See, for example, the front page of the Saturday, 1974-10-26
# and Sunday, 1974-10-27 editions of the Washington Post.

# From Arthur David Olson:
# Before the Uniform Time Act of 1966 took effect in 1967, observance of
# Daylight Saving Time in the US was by local option, except during wartime.

# From Arthur David Olson (2000-09-25):
# Last night I heard part of a rebroadcast of a 1945 Arch Oboler radio drama.
# In the introduction, Oboler spoke of "Eastern Peace Time."
# An AltaVista search turned up:
# http://rowayton.org/rhs/hstaug45.html
# "When the time is announced over the radio now, it is 'Eastern Peace
# Time' instead of the old familiar 'Eastern War Time.'  Peace is wonderful."
# (August 1945) by way of confirmation.

# From Joseph Gallant citing
# George H. Douglas, _The Early Days of Radio Broadcasting_ (1987):
# At 7 P.M. (Eastern War Time) [on 1945-08-14], the networks were set
# to switch to London for Attlee's address, but the American people
# never got to hear his speech live. According to one press account,
# CBS' Bob Trout was first to announce the word of Japan's surrender,
# but a few seconds later, NBC, ABC and Mutual also flashed the word
# of surrender, all of whom interrupting the bells of Big Ben in
# London which were to precede Mr. Attlee's speech.

# From Paul Eggert (2003-02-09): It was Robert St John, not Bob Trout.  From
# Myrna Oliver's obituary of St John on page B16 of today's Los Angeles Times:
#
# ... a war-weary U.S. clung to radios, awaiting word of Japan's surrender.
# Any announcement from Asia would reach St. John's New York newsroom on a
# wire service teletype machine, which had prescribed signals for major news.
# Associated Press, for example, would ring five bells before spewing out
# typed copy of an important story, and 10 bells for news "of transcendental
# importance."
#
# On Aug. 14, stalling while talking steadily into the NBC networks' open
# microphone, St. John heard five bells and waited only to hear a sixth bell,
# before announcing confidently: "Ladies and gentlemen, World War II is over.
# The Japanese have agreed to our surrender terms."
#
# He had scored a 20-second scoop on other broadcasters.

# From Arthur David Olson (2005-08-22):
# Paul has been careful to use the "US" rules only in those locations
# that are part of the United States; this reflects the real scope of
# U.S. government action.  So even though the "US" rules have changed
# in the latest release, other countries won't be affected.

# From Arthur David Olson (1988-02-13):
# Legal standard time zone names, from United States Code (1982 Edition and
# Supplement III), Title 15, Chapter 6, Section 260 and forward.  First, names
# up to 1967-04-01 (when most provisions of the Uniform Time Act of 1966
# took effect), as explained in sections 263 and 261:
#	(none)
#	United States standard eastern time
#	United States standard mountain time
#	United States standard central time
#	United States standard Pacific time
#	(none)
#	United States standard Alaska time
#	(none)
# Next, names from 1967-04-01 until 1983-11-30 (the date for
# public law 98-181):
#	Atlantic standard time
#	eastern standard time
#	central standard time
#	mountain standard time
#	Pacific standard time
#	Yukon standard time
#	Alaska-Hawaii standard time
#	Bering standard time
# And after 1983-11-30:
#	Atlantic standard time
#	eastern standard time
#	central standard time
#	mountain standard time
#	Pacific standard time
#	Alaska standard time
#	Hawaii-Aleutian standard time
#	Samoa standard time
# The law doesn't give abbreviations.

# http://uscode.house.gov/statviewer.htm?volume=40&page=451
# http://uscode.house.gov/statviewer.htm?volume=80&page=108
# Although the 1918 names were officially "United States Standard
# Eastern Time" and similarly for "Central", "Mountain", "Pacific",
# and "Alaska", in practice "Standard" was placed just before "Time",
# as codified in 1966.  In practice, Alaska time was abbreviated "AST"
# before 1968.  Summarizing the 1967 name changes:
#	1918 names			1967 names

#  -09	(unofficial) Yukon (YST)	Yukon standard time (YST)
#  -10	Standard Alaska Time (AST)	Alaska-Hawaii standard time (AHST)

# The following was signed into law on 2005-08-08.
#
# H.R. 6, Energy Policy Act of 2005, SEC. 110. DAYLIGHT SAVINGS.
#   (a) Amendment.--Section 3(a) of the Uniform Time Act of 1966 (15
#   U.S.C. 260a(a)) is amended--
#     (1) by striking "first Sunday of April" and inserting "second

# From Dave Cantor (2004-11-02):
# Early this summer I had the occasion to visit the Mount Washington
# Observatory weather station atop (of course!) Mount Washington [, NH]....
# One of the staff members said that the station was on Eastern Standard Time
# and didn't change their clocks for Daylight Saving ... so that their
# reports will always have times which are 5 hours behind UTC.

# From Paul Eggert (2005-08-26):
# According to today's Huntsville Times
# http://www.al.com/news/huntsvilletimes/index.ssf?/base/news/1125047783228320.xml&coll=1
# a few towns on Alabama's "eastern border with Georgia, such as Phenix City
# in Russell County, Lanett in Chambers County and some towns in Lee County,
# set their watches and clocks on Eastern time."  It quotes H.H. "Bubba"
# Roberts, city administrator in Phenix City. as saying "We are in the Central
# time zone, but we do go by the Eastern time zone because so many people work
# in Columbus."
#
# From Paul Eggert (2017-02-22):
# Four cities are involved.  The two not mentioned above are Smiths Station
# and Valley.  Barbara Brooks, Valley's assistant treasurer, heard it started
# because West Point Pepperell textile mills were in Alabama while the
# corporate office was in Georgia, and residents voted to keep Eastern
# time even after the mills closed.  See: Kazek K. Did you know which
# Alabama towns are in a different time zone?  al.com 2017-02-06.

#
# From Paul Eggert (2015-12-25):

# From Paul Eggert (2016-08-20):
# In early February 1948, in response to California's electricity shortage,
# PG&E changed power frequency from 60 to 59.5 Hz during daylight hours,
# causing electric clocks to lose six minutes per day.  (This did not change
# legal time, and is not part of the data here.)  See:
# Ross SA. An energy crisis from the past: Northern California in 1948.
# Working Paper No. 8, Institute of Governmental Studies, UC Berkeley,
# 1973-11.  http://escholarship.org/uc/item/8x22k30c
#
# In another measure to save electricity, DST was instituted from 1948-03-14
# at 02:01 to 1949-01-16 at 02:00, with the governor having the option to move
# the fallback transition earlier.  See pages 3-4 of:
# http://clerk.assembly.ca.gov/sites/clerk.assembly.ca.gov/files/archive/Statutes/1948/48Vol1_Chapters.pdf
#
# In response:
#
#   Governor Warren received a torrent of objecting mail, and it is not too much
#   to speculate that the objections to Daylight Saving Time were one important
#   factor in the defeat of the Dewey-Warren Presidential ticket in California.
#     -- Ross, p 25
#
# On December 8 the governor exercised the option, setting the date to January 1
# (LA Times 1948-12-09).  The transition time was 02:00 (LA Times 1949-01-01).
#
# Despite the controversy, in 1949 California voters approved Proposition 12,
# which established DST from April's last Sunday at 01:00 until September's
# last Sunday at 02:00. This was amended by 1962's Proposition 6, which changed
# the fall-back date to October's last Sunday. See:

# Alaska
# AK%sT is the modern abbreviation for -09 per USNO.
#
# From Paul Eggert (2001-05-30):
# Howse writes that Alaska switched from the Julian to the Gregorian calendar,
# and from east-of-GMT to west-of-GMT days, when the US bought it from Russia.
# This was on 1867-10-18, a Friday; the previous day was 1867-10-06 Julian,
# also a Friday.  Include only the time zone part of this transition,
# ignoring the switch from Julian to Gregorian, since we can't represent
# the Julian calendar.
#
# As far as we know, none of the exact locations mentioned below were
# permanently inhabited in 1867 by anyone using either calendar.
# (Yakutat was colonized by the Russians in 1799, but the settlement
# was destroyed in 1805 by a Yakutat-kon war party.)  However, there
# were nearby inhabitants in some cases and for our purposes perhaps
# it's best to simply use the official transition.

# From Paul Eggert (2014-07-18):
# One opinion of the early-1980s turmoil in Alaska over time zones and
# daylight saving time appeared as graffiti on a Juneau airport wall:
# "Welcome to Juneau.  Please turn your watch back to the 19th century."
# See: Turner W. Alaska's four time zones now two. NY Times 1983-11-01.
# http://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/01/us/alaska-s-four-time-zones-now-two.html

# Alaska History 2001;16(1-2).
# http://alaskahistoricalsociety.org/discover-alaska/glimpses-of-the-past/keeping-time-in-alaska/

# From Arthur David Olson (2011-02-01):
# Here's database-relevant material from the 2001 "Alaska History" article:
#
# On September 20 [1979]...DOT...officials decreed that on April 27,
# 1980, Juneau and other nearby communities would move to Yukon Time.
# Sitka, Petersburg, Wrangell, and Ketchikan, however, would remain on
# Pacific Time.
#
# ...on September 22, 1980, DOT Secretary Neil E. Goldschmidt rescinded the
# Department's September 1979 decision. Juneau and other communities in
# northern Southeast reverted to Pacific Time on October 26.
#
# On October 28 [1983]...the Metlakatla Indian Community Council voted
# unanimously to keep the reservation on Pacific Time.
#
# According to DOT official Joanne Petrie, Indian reservations are not
# bound to follow time zones imposed by neighboring jurisdictions.
#
# (The last is consistent with how the database now handles the Navajo
# Nation.)

# From Arthur David Olson (2011-02-09):
# I just spoke by phone with a staff member at the Metlakatla Indian
# Community office (using contact information available at
# http://www.commerce.state.ak.us/dca/commdb/CIS.cfm?Comm_Boro_name=Metlakatla
# It's shortly after 1:00 here on the east coast of the United States;
# the staffer said it was shortly after 10:00 there. When I asked whether
# that meant they were on Pacific time, they said no - they were on their
# own time. I asked about daylight saving; they said it wasn't used. I
# did not inquire about practices in the past.

# From Arthur David Olson (2011-08-17):
# For lack of better information, assume that Metlakatla's
# abandonment of use of daylight saving resulted from the 1983 vote.

# From Steffen Thorsen (2015-11-09):
# It seems Metlakatla did go off PST on Sunday, November 1, changing
# their time to AKST and are going to follow Alaska's DST, switching
# between AKST and AKDT from now on....

# The following switches don't quite make our 1970 cutoff.
#
# Shanks writes that part of southwest Alaska (e.g. Aniak)
# switched from -11:00 to -10:00 on 1968-09-22 at 02:00,
# and another part (e.g. Akiak) made the same switch five weeks later.
#
# From David Flater (2004-11-09):
# In e-mail, 2004-11-02, Ray Hudson, historian/liaison to the Unalaska
# Historic Preservation Commission, provided this information, which
# suggests that Unalaska deviated from statutory time from early 1967
# possibly until 1983:
#
#  Minutes of the Unalaska City Council Meeting, January 10, 1967:
#  "Except for St. Paul and Akutan, Unalaska is the only important
#  location not on Alaska Standard Time.  The following resolution was
#  made by William Robinson and seconded by Henry Swanson: Be it
#  resolved that the City of Unalaska hereby goes to Alaska Standard
#  Time as of midnight Friday, January 13, 1967 (1 A.M. Saturday,
#  January 14, Alaska Standard Time.)  This resolution was passed with
#  three votes for and one against."

# Hawaii

# From Arthur David Olson (2010-12-09):
# "Hawaiian Time" by Robert C. Schmitt and Doak C. Cox appears on pages 207-225
# of volume 26 of The Hawaiian Journal of History (1992). As of 2010-12-09,
# the article is available at
# http://evols.library.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/10524/239/2/JL26215.pdf
# and indicates that standard time was adopted effective noon, January
# 13, 1896 (page 218), that in "1933, the Legislature decreed daylight
# saving for the period between the last Sunday of each April and the
# last Sunday of each September, but less than a month later repealed the
# act," (page 220), that year-round daylight saving time was in effect
# from 1942-02-09 to 1945-09-30 (page 221, with no time of day given for
# when clocks changed) and that clocks were changed by 30 minutes
# effective the second Sunday of June, 1947 (page 219, with no time of
# day given for when clocks changed). A footnote for the 1933 changes
# cites Session Laws of Hawaii 1933, "Act. 90 (approved 26 Apr. 1933)
# and Act 163 (approved 21 May 1933)."

# From Arthur David Olson (2011-01-19):
# The following is from "Laws of the Territory of Hawaii Passed by the
# Seventeenth Legislature: Regular Session 1933," available (as of
# 2011-01-19) at American University's Pence Law Library. Page 85: "Act
# 90...At 2 o'clock ante meridian of the last Sunday in April of each
# year, the standard time of this Territory shall be advanced one
# hour...This Act shall take effect upon its approval. Approved this 26th
# day of April, A. D. 1933. LAWRENCE M JUDD, Governor of the Territory of
# Hawaii." Page 172: "Act 163...Act 90 of the Session Laws of 1933 is
# hereby repealed...This Act shall take effect upon its approval, upon
# which date the standard time of this Territory shall be restored to
# that existing immediately prior to the taking effect of said Act 90.
# Approved this 21st day of May, A. D. 1933. LAWRENCE M. JUDD, Governor
# of the Territory of Hawaii."
#
# Note that 1933-05-21 was a Sunday.
# We're left to guess the time of day when Act 163 was approved; guess noon.

# Now we turn to US areas that have diverged from the consensus since 1970.

# Arizona mostly uses MST.

# From Paul Eggert (2002-10-20):
#
# The information in the rest of this paragraph is derived from the
# Daylight Saving Time web page
# <http://www.dlapr.lib.az.us/links/daylight.htm> (2002-01-23)
# maintained by the Arizona State Library, Archives and Public Records.
# Between 1944-01-01 and 1944-04-01 the State of Arizona used standard
# time, but by federal law railroads, airlines, bus lines, military
# personnel, and some engaged in interstate commerce continued to
# observe war (i.e., daylight saving) time.  The 1944-03-17 Phoenix
# Gazette says that was the date the law changed, and that 04-01 was
# the date the state's clocks would change.  In 1945 the State of
# Arizona used standard time all year, again with exceptions only as
# mandated by federal law.  Arizona observed DST in 1967, but Arizona
# Laws 1968, ch. 183 (effective 1968-03-21) repealed DST.
#
# Shanks says the 1944 experiment came to an end on 1944-03-17.
# Go with the Arizona State Library instead.

# Indiana
#
# For a map of Indiana's time zone regions, see:
# http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_in_Indiana
#
# From Paul Eggert (2007-08-17):
# Since 1970, most of Indiana has been like America/Indiana/Indianapolis,
# with the following exceptions:
#
# - Gibson, Jasper, Lake, LaPorte, Newton, Porter, Posey, Spencer,
#   Vanderburgh, and Warrick counties have been like America/Chicago.
#
# - Dearborn and Ohio counties have been like America/New_York.
#
# - Clark, Floyd, and Harrison counties have been like
#   America/Kentucky/Louisville.
#
# - Crawford, Daviess, Dubois, Knox, Martin, Perry, Pike, Pulaski, Starke,
#   and Switzerland counties have their own time zone histories as noted below.
#
# Shanks partitioned Indiana into 345 regions, each with its own time history,
# and wrote "Even newspaper reports present contradictory information."
# Those Hoosiers!  Such a flighty and changeable people!
# Fortunately, most of the complexity occurred before our cutoff date of 1970.
#
# Other than Indianapolis, the Indiana place names are so nondescript
# that they would be ambiguous if we left them at the 'America' level.
# So we reluctantly put them all in a subdirectory 'America/Indiana'.

# From Paul Eggert (2014-06-26):
# https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2006/01/20/06-563/standard-time-zone-boundary-in-the-state-of-indiana
# says "DOT is relocating the time zone boundary in Indiana to move Starke,
# Pulaski, Knox, Daviess, Martin, Pike, Dubois, and Perry Counties from the
# Eastern Time Zone to the Central Time Zone.... The effective date of
# this rule is 2 a.m. EST Sunday, April 2, 2006, which is the
# changeover date from standard time to Daylight Saving Time."
# Strictly speaking, this meant the affected counties changed their
# clocks twice that night, but this obviously was in error.  The intent
# was that 01:59:59 EST be followed by 02:00:00 CDT.

# From Gwillim Law (2007-02-10):
# The Associated Press has been reporting that Pulaski County, Indiana is
# going to switch from Central to Eastern Time on March 11, 2007....

#
# From Lake Cumberland LIFE
# http://www.lake-cumberland.com/life/archive/news990129time.shtml
# (1999-01-29) via WKYM-101.7:
# Clinton County has joined Wayne County in asking the DoT to change from
# the Central to the Eastern time zone....  The Wayne County government made
# the same request in December.  And while Russell County officials have not
# taken action, the majority of respondents to a poll conducted there in
# August indicated they would like to change to "fast time" also.
# The three Lake Cumberland counties are the farthest east of any U.S.
# location in the Central time zone.
#
# From Rich Wales (2000-08-29):
# After prolonged debate, and despite continuing deep differences of opinion,
# Wayne County (central Kentucky) is switching from Central (-0600) to Eastern
# (-0500) time.  They won't "fall back" this year.  See Sara Shipley,
# The difference an hour makes, Nando Times (2000-08-29 15:33 -0400).
#
# From Paul Eggert (2001-07-16):

# We don't know where the line used to be within Kearny County, KS,
# so omit that change for now.
# See America/Indiana/Knox for the Starke County, IN change.
# See America/North_Dakota/Center for the Oliver County, ND change.
# West Wendover, NV officially switched from Pacific to mountain time on
# 1999-10-31.  See the
# Federal Register 64, 203 (1999-10-21), pp 56705-56707.
# http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=1999_register&docid=fr21oc99-15
# However, the Federal Register says that West Wendover already operated
# on mountain time, and the rule merely made this official;
# hence a separate tz entry is not needed.

# Michigan
#
# From Bob Devine (1988-01-28):
# Michigan didn't observe DST from 1968 to 1973.
#
# From Paul Eggert (1999-03-31):
# Shanks writes that Michigan started using standard time on 1885-09-18,
# but Howse writes (pp 124-125, referring to Popular Astronomy, 1901-01)
# that Detroit kept
#
#	local time until 1900 when the City Council decreed that clocks should
#	be put back twenty-eight minutes to Central Standard Time.  Half the
#	city obeyed, half refused.  After considerable debate, the decision
#	was rescinded and the city reverted to Sun time.  A derisive offer to
#	erect a sundial in front of the city hall was referred to the
#	Committee on Sewers.  Then, in 1905, Central time was adopted
#	by city vote.
#
# This story is too entertaining to be false, so go with Howse over Shanks.
#
# From Paul Eggert (2001-03-06):
# Garland (1927) writes "Cleveland and Detroit advanced their clocks
# one hour in 1914."  This change is not in Shanks.  We have no more
# info, so omit this for now.
#
# Most of Michigan observed DST from 1973 on, but was a bit late in 1975.

# "It's about TIME", _Canadian Geographic_ (September-October 1998)
# http://www.canadiangeographic.ca/Magazine/SO98/alacarte.asp

# Its unofficial information is often taken from Matthews and Vincent.

# From Paul Eggert (2006-06-27):
# For now, assume all of DST-observing Canada will fall into line with the
# new US DST rules,

# From Chris Walton (2011-12-01)
# In the first of Tammy Hardwick's articles
# http://www.ilovecreston.com/?p=articles&t=spec&ar=260
# she quotes the Friday November 1/1918 edition of the Creston Review.
# The quote includes these two statements:
# 'Sunday the CPR went back to the old system of time...'
# '... The daylight saving scheme was dropped all over Canada at the same time,'
# These statements refer to a transition from daylight time to standard time
# that occurred nationally on Sunday October 27/1918.  This transition was
# also documented in the Saturday October 26/1918 edition of the Toronto Star.

# In light of that evidence, we alter the date from the earlier believed
# Oct 31, to Oct 27, 1918 (and Sunday is a more likely transition day
# than Thursday) in all Canadian rulesets.

# west Labrador, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward I

# From Brian Inglis (2015-07-20):
# From the historical weather station records available at:
# https://weatherspark.com/history/28351/1971/Sydney-Nova-Scotia-Canada
# Sydney shares the same time history as Glace Bay, so was
# likely to be the same across the island....
# Sydney, as the capital and most populous location, or Cape Breton, would
# have been better names for the zone had we known this in 1996.

# From Paul Eggert (2015-07-20):
# Shanks & Pottenger write that since 1970 most of this region has been like
# Halifax.  Many locales did not observe peacetime DST until 1972;
# the Cape Breton area, represented by Glace Bay, is the largest we know of
# (Glace Bay was perhaps not the best name choice but no point changing now).
# Shanks & Pottenger also write that Liverpool, NS was the only town
# in Canada to observe DST in 1971 but not 1970; for now we'll assume
# this is a typo.

# Quebec

# From Paul Eggert (2015-03-24):
# See America/Toronto for most of Quebec, including Montreal.
#
# Matthews and Vincent (1998) also write that Quebec east of the -63
# meridian is supposed to observe AST, but residents as far east as
# Natashquan use EST/EDT, and residents east of Natashquan use AST.
# The Quebec department of justice writes in
# "The situation in Minganie and Basse-Côte-Nord"
# http://www.justice.gouv.qc.ca/english/publications/generale/temps-minganie-a.htm
# that the coastal strip from just east of Natashquan to Blanc-Sablon
# observes Atlantic standard time all year round.
# http://www.assnat.qc.ca/Media/Process.aspx?MediaId=ANQ.Vigie.Bll.DocumentGenerique_8845en
# says this common practice was codified into law as of 2007.
# For lack of better info, guess this practice began around 1970, contra to
# Shanks & Pottenger who have this region observing AST/ADT.

# Ontario

# From Paul Eggert (2006-07-09):
# Shanks & Pottenger write that since 1970 most of Ontario has been like
# Toronto.
# Thunder Bay skipped DST in 1973.
# Many smaller locales did not observe peacetime DST until 1974;
# Nipigon (EST) and Rainy River (CST) are the largest that we know of.
# Far west Ontario is like Winnipeg; far east Quebec is like Halifax.

# From Mark Brader (2003-07-26):
# [According to the Toronto Star] Orillia, Ontario, adopted DST
# effective Saturday, 1912-06-22, 22:00; the article mentions that
# Port Arthur (now part of Thunder Bay, Ontario) as well as Moose Jaw
# have already done so.  In Orillia DST was to run until Saturday,
# 1912-08-31 (no time mentioned), but it was met with considerable
# hostility from certain segments of the public, and was revoked after
# only two weeks - I copied it as Saturday, 1912-07-07, 22:00, but
# presumably that should be -07-06.  (1912-06-19, -07-12; also letters
# earlier in June).
#
# Kenora, Ontario, was to abandon DST on 1914-06-01 (-05-21).

# From Paul Eggert (1997-10-17):
# Mark Brader writes that an article in the 1997-10-14 Toronto Star
# says that Atikokan, Ontario currently does not observe DST,
# but will vote on 11-10 whether to use EST/EDT.
# He also writes that the Ontario Time Act (1990, Chapter T.9)
# http://www.gov.on.ca/MBS/english/publications/statregs/conttext.html
# says that Ontario east of 90W uses EST/EDT, and west of 90W uses CST/CDT.
# Officially Atikokan is therefore on CST/CDT, and most likely this report
# concerns a non-official time observed as a matter of local practice.
#
# From Paul Eggert (2000-10-02):
# Matthews and Vincent (1998) write that Atikokan, Pickle Lake, and
# New Osnaburgh observe CST all year, that Big Trout Lake observes
# CST/CDT, and that Upsala and Shebandowan observe EST/EDT, all in
# violation of the official Ontario rules.
#
# From Paul Eggert (2006-07-09):
# Chris Walton (2006-07-06) mentioned an article by Stephanie MacLellan in the
# 2005-07-21 Chronicle-Journal, which said:
#
#	The clocks in Atikokan stay set on standard time year-round.
#	This means they spend about half the time on central time and
#	the other half on eastern time.
#
#	For the most part, the system works, Mayor Dennis Brown said.
#
#	"The majority of businesses in Atikokan deal more with Eastern
#	Canada, but there are some that deal with Western Canada," he
#	said.  "I don't see any changes happening here."
#
# Walton also writes "Supposedly Pickle Lake and Mishkeegogamang
# [New Osnaburgh] follow the same practice."

# From Garry McKinnon (2006-07-14) via Chris Walton:
# I chatted with a member of my board who has an outstanding memory
# and a long history in Atikokan (and in the telecom industry) and he
# can say for certain that Atikokan has been practicing the current
# time keeping since 1952, at least.

# From Paul Eggert (2006-07-17):
# Shanks & Pottenger say that Atikokan has agreed with Rainy River
# ever since standard time was introduced, but the information from
# McKinnon sounds more authoritative.  For now, assume that Atikokan
# switched to EST immediately after WWII era daylight saving time
# ended.  This matches the old (less-populous) America/Coral_Harbour
# entry since our cutoff date of 1970, so we can move
# America/Coral_Harbour to the 'backward' file.

# From Mark Brader (2010-03-06):

#
# # Ontario
#
# # From Paul Eggert (2006-07-09):
# # Shanks & Pottenger write that since 1970 most of Ontario has been like
# # Toronto.
# # Thunder Bay skipped DST in 1973.
# # Many smaller locales did not observe peacetime DST until 1974;
# # Nipigon (EST) and Rainy River (CST) are the largest that we know of.
#
# In the (Toronto) Globe and Mail for Saturday, 1955-09-24, in the bottom
# right corner of page 1, it says that Toronto will return to standard
# time at 2 am Sunday morning (which agrees with the database), and that:
#
#     The one-hour setback will go into effect throughout most of Ontario,
#     except in areas like Windsor which remains on standard time all year.
#
# Windsor is, of course, a lot larger than Nipigon.
#
# I only came across this incidentally.  I don't know if Windsor began
# observing DST when Detroit did, or in 1974, or on some other date.
#
# By the way, the article continues by noting that:
#
#     Some cities in the United States have pushed the deadline back
#     three weeks and will change over from daylight saving in October.

# From Arthur David Olson (2010-07-17):
#
# "Standard Time and Time Zones in Canada" appeared in
# The Journal of The Royal Astronomical Society of Canada,
# volume 26, number 2 (February 1932) and, as of 2010-07-17,
# was available at
# http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1932JRASC..26...49S
#
# It includes the text below (starting on page 57):
#
#   A list of the places in Canada using daylight saving time would
# require yearly revision. From information kindly furnished by
# the provincial governments and by the postmasters in many cities
# and towns, it is found that the following places used daylight sav-
# ing in 1930. The information for the province of Quebec is definite,
# for the other provinces only approximate:
#
#	Province	Daylight saving time used
# Prince Edward Island	Not used.
# Nova Scotia		In Halifax only.
# New Brunswick		In St. John only.
# Quebec		In the following places:
#			Montreal	Lachine
#			Quebec		Mont-Royal
#			Lévis		Iberville
#			St. Lambert	Cap de la Madelèine
#			Verdun		Loretteville
#			Westmount	Richmond
#			Outremont	St. Jérôme
#			Longueuil	Greenfield Park
#			Arvida		Waterloo
#			Chambly-Canton	Beaulieu
#			Melbourne	La Tuque
#			St. Théophile	Buckingham
# Ontario		Used generally in the cities and towns along
#			the southerly part of the province. Not
#			used in the northwesterly part.
# Manitoba		Not used.
# Saskatchewan		In Regina only.
# Alberta		Not used.
# British Columbia	Not used.
#
#   With some exceptions, the use of daylight saving may be said to be limited
# to those cities and towns lying between Quebec city and Windsor, Ont.

# Time Zones was permanently moved about two hundred miles west to

# savings time in 1916, Fort William and Port Arthur, having done so
# already, did not change their clocks....  During the Second World
# War,... [t]he cities agreed to implement DST during the summer
# months for the remainder of the war years.

# Manitoba

# From Rob Douglas (2006-04-06):
# the old Manitoba Time Act - as amended by Bill 2, assented to
# March 27, 1987 ... said ...
# "between two o'clock Central Standard Time in the morning of
# the first Sunday of April of each year and two o'clock Central
# Standard Time in the morning of the last Sunday of October next
# following, one hour in advance of Central Standard Time."...
# I believe that the English legislation [of the old time act] had
# been assented to (March 22, 1967)....
# Also, as far as I can tell, there was no order-in-council varying
# the time of Daylight Saving Time for 2005 and so the provisions of
# the 1987 version would apply - the changeover was at 2:00 Central
# Standard Time (i.e. not until 3:00 Central Daylight Time).

# From Paul Eggert (2006-04-10):
# Shanks & Pottenger say Manitoba switched at 02:00 (not 02:00s)
# starting 1966.  Since 02:00s is clearly correct for 1967 on, assume
# it was also 02:00s in 1966.

# Saskatchewan

# From Mark Brader (2003-07-26):
# The first actual adoption of DST in Canada was at the municipal
# level.  As the [Toronto] Star put it (1912-06-07), "While people
# elsewhere have long been talking of legislation to save daylight,
# the city of Moose Jaw [Saskatchewan] has acted on its own hook."
# DST in Moose Jaw began on Saturday, 1912-06-01 (no time mentioned:
# presumably late evening, as below), and would run until "the end of
# the summer".  The discrepancy between municipal time and railroad
# time was noted.

# From Paul Eggert (2003-07-27):
# Willett (1914-03) notes that DST "has been in operation ... in the
# City of Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan, for one year."

# From Paul Eggert (2006-03-22):
# Shanks & Pottenger say that since 1970 this region has mostly been as Regina.
# Some western towns (e.g. Swift Current) switched from MST/MDT to CST in 1972.
# Other western towns (e.g. Lloydminster) are like Edmonton.
# Matthews and Vincent (1998) write that Denare Beach and Creighton
# are like Winnipeg, in violation of Saskatchewan law.

# From W. Jones (1992-11-06):
# The. . .below is based on information I got from our law library, the
# provincial archives, and the provincial Community Services department.
# A precise history would require digging through newspaper archives, and
# since you didn't say what you wanted, I didn't bother.
#
# Saskatchewan is split by a time zone meridian (105W) and over the years
# the boundary became pretty ragged as communities near it reevaluated
# their affiliations in one direction or the other.  In 1965 a provincial
# referendum favoured legislating common time practices.
#
# On 15 April 1966 the Time Act (c. T-14, Revised Statutes of
# Saskatchewan 1978) was proclaimed, and established that the eastern
# part of Saskatchewan would use CST year round, that districts in
# northwest Saskatchewan would by default follow CST but could opt to
# follow Mountain Time rules (thus 1 hour difference in the winter and
# zero in the summer), and that districts in southwest Saskatchewan would
# by default follow MT but could opt to follow CST.
#
# It took a few years for the dust to settle (I know one story of a town
# on one time zone having its school in another, such that a mom had to
# serve her family lunch in two shifts), but presently it seems that only
# a few towns on the border with Alberta (e.g. Lloydminster) follow MT
# rules any more; all other districts appear to have used CST year round
# since sometime in the 1960s.

# From Chris Walton (2006-06-26):
# The Saskatchewan time act which was last updated in 1996 is about 30 pages
# long and rather painful to read.

# British Columbia

# From Paul Eggert (2006-03-22):
# Shanks & Pottenger write that since 1970 most of this region has
# been like Vancouver.
# Dawson Creek uses MST.  Much of east BC is like Edmonton.
# Matthews and Vincent (1998) write that Creston is like Dawson Creek.

# It seems though that (re: Creston) is not entirely correct:

# From Chris Walton (2011-12-01):
# There are two areas within the Canadian province of British Columbia
# that do not currently observe daylight saving:
# a) The Creston Valley (includes the town of Creston and surrounding area)
# b) The eastern half of the Peace River Regional District
# (includes the cities of Dawson Creek and Fort St. John)

# Earlier this year I stumbled across a detailed article about the time
# keeping history of Creston; it was written by Tammy Hardwick who is the
# manager of the Creston & District Museum. The article was written in May 2009.
# http://www.ilovecreston.com/?p=articles&t=spec&ar=260
# According to the article, Creston has not changed its clocks since June 1918.
# i.e. Creston has been stuck on UTC-7 for 93 years.
# Dawson Creek, on the other hand, changed its clocks as recently as April 1972.

# Unfortunately the exact date for the time change in June 1918 remains
# unknown and will be difficult to ascertain.  I e-mailed Tammy a few months
# ago to ask if Sunday June 2 was a reasonable guess.  She said it was just
# as plausible as any other date (in June).  She also said that after writing
# the article she had discovered another time change in 1916; this is the
# subject of another article which she wrote in October 2010.
# http://www.creston.museum.bc.ca/index.php?module=comments&uop=view_comment&cm+id=56

# Here is a summary of the three clock change events in Creston's history:
# 1. 1884 or 1885: adoption of Mountain Standard Time (GMT-7)
# Exact date unknown
# 2. Oct 1916: switch to Pacific Standard Time (GMT-8)
# Exact date in October unknown; Sunday October 1 is a reasonable guess.
# 3. June 1918: switch to Pacific Daylight Time (GMT-7)
# Exact date in June unknown; Sunday June 2 is a reasonable guess.
# note 1:
# On Oct 27/1918 when daylight saving ended in the rest of Canada,
# Creston did not change its clocks.
# note 2:
# During WWII when the Federal Government legislated a mandatory clock change,
# Creston did not oblige.
# note 3:
# There is no guarantee that Creston will remain on Mountain Standard Time
# (UTC-7) forever.
# The subject was debated at least once this year by the town Council.
# http://www.bclocalnews.com/kootenay_rockies/crestonvalleyadvance/news/116760809.html

# During a period WWII, summer time (Daylight saying) was mandatory in Canada.
# In Creston, that was handled by shifting the area to PST (-8:00) then applying
# summer time to cause the offset to be -7:00, the same as it had been before
# the change.  It can be argued that the timezone abbreviation during this
# period should be PDT rather than MST, but that doesn't seem important enough
# (to anyone) to further complicate the rules.

# The transition dates (and times) are guesses.

# From Matt Johnson (2015-09-21):
# Fort Nelson, BC, Canada will cancel DST this year.  So while previously they
# were aligned with America/Vancouver, they're now aligned with
# America/Dawson_Creek.
# http://www.northernrockies.ca/EN/meta/news/archives/2015/northern-rockies-time-change.html
#
# From Tim Parenti (2015-09-23):
# This requires a new zone for the Northern Rockies Regional Municipality,
# America/Fort_Nelson.  The resolution of 2014-12-08 was reached following a
# 2014-11-15 poll with nearly 75% support.  Effectively, the municipality has
# been on MST (-0700) like Dawson Creek since it advanced its clocks on
# 2015-03-08.
#
# From Paul Eggert (2015-09-23):
# Shanks says Fort Nelson did not observe DST in 1946, unlike Vancouver.

# From Rives McDow (1999-09-04):
# Nunavut ... moved ... to incorporate the whole territory into one time zone.
# Nunavut moves to single time zone Oct. 31
# http://www.nunatsiaq.com/nunavut/nvt90903_13.html
#
# From Antoine Leca (1999-09-06):
# We then need to create a new timezone for the Kitikmeot region of Nunavut
# to differentiate it from the Yellowknife region.

# From Paul Eggert (1999-09-20):
# Basic Facts: The New Territory
# http://www.nunavut.com/basicfacts/english/basicfacts_1territory.html
# (1999) reports that Pangnirtung operates on eastern time,
# and that Coral Harbour does not observe DST.  We don't know when
# Pangnirtung switched to eastern time; we'll guess 1995.

# From Rives McDow (1999-11-08):
# On October 31, when the rest of Nunavut went to Central time,
# Pangnirtung wobbled.  Here is the result of their wobble:
#
# The following businesses and organizations in Pangnirtung use Central Time:
#
#	First Air, Power Corp, Nunavut Construction, Health Center, RCMP,
#	Eastern Arctic National Parks, A & D Specialist
#
# The following businesses and organizations in Pangnirtung use Eastern Time:
#
#	Hamlet office, All other businesses, Both schools, Airport operator
#
# This has made for an interesting situation there, which warranted the news.
# No one there that I spoke with seems concerned, or has plans to
# change the local methods of keeping time, as it evidently does not
# really interfere with any activities or make things difficult locally.
# They plan to celebrate New Year's turn-over twice, one hour apart,
# so it appears that the situation will last at least that long.
# The Nunavut Intergovernmental Affairs hopes that they will "come to
# their senses", but the locals evidently don't see any problem with
# the current state of affairs.

# From Michaela Rodrigue, writing in the
# Nunatsiaq News (1999-11-19):
# http://www.nunatsiaq.com/archives/nunavut991130/nvt91119_17.html
# Clyde River, Pangnirtung and Sanikiluaq now operate with two time zones,
# central - or Nunavut time - for government offices, and eastern time
# for municipal offices and schools....  Igloolik [was similar but then]
# made the switch to central time on Saturday, Nov. 6.

# From Paul Eggert (2000-10-02):
# Matthews and Vincent (1998) say the following, but we lack histories
# for these potential new Zones.
#
# The Canadian Forces station at Alert uses Eastern Time while the
# handful of residents at the Eureka weather station [in the Central
# zone] skip daylight savings.  Baffin Island, which is crossed by the
# Central, Eastern and Atlantic Time zones only uses Eastern Time.
# Gjoa Haven, Taloyoak and Pelly Bay all use Mountain instead of
# Central Time and Southampton Island [in the Central zone] is not
# required to use daylight savings.

# From <http://www.nunatsiaq.com/archives/nunavut001130/nvt21110_02.html>
# Nunavut now has two time zones (2000-11-10):
# The Nunavut government would allow its employees in Kugluktuk and
# Cambridge Bay to operate on central time year-round, putting them
# one hour behind the rest of Nunavut for six months during the winter.
# At the end of October the two communities had rebelled against
# Nunavut's unified time zone, refusing to shift to eastern time with
# the rest of the territory for the winter.  Cambridge Bay remained on
# central time, while Kugluktuk, even farther west, reverted to
# mountain time, which they had used before the advent of Nunavut's
# unified time zone in 1999.
#
# From Rives McDow (2001-01-20), quoting the Nunavut government:
# The preceding decision came into effect at midnight, Saturday Nov 4, 2000.

# From Paul Eggert (2000-12-04):
# Let's just keep track of the official times for now.

# From Rives McDow (2001-03-07):
# The premier of Nunavut has issued a ministerial statement advising
# that effective 2001-04-01, the territory of Nunavut will revert
# back to three time zones (mountain, central, and eastern).  Of the
# cities in Nunavut, Coral Harbor is the only one that I know of that
# has said it will not observe dst, staying on EST year round.  I'm
# checking for more info, and will get back to you if I come up with
# more.
# [Also see <http://www.nunatsiaq.com/nunavut/nvt10309_06.html> (2001-03-09).]

# From Gwillim Law (2005-05-21):
# According to ...
# http://www.canadiangeographic.ca/Magazine/SO98/geomap.asp
# (from a 1998 Canadian Geographic article), the de facto and de jure time
# for Southampton Island (at the north end of Hudson Bay) is UTC-5 all year
# round.  Using Google, it's easy to find other websites that confirm this.
# I wasn't able to find how far back this time regimen goes, but since it
# predates the creation of Nunavut, it probably goes back many years....
# The Inuktitut name of Coral Harbour is Sallit, but it's rarely used.
#
# From Paul Eggert (2014-10-17):
# For lack of better information, assume that Southampton Island observed
# daylight saving only during wartime.  Gwillim Law's email also
# mentioned maps now maintained by National Research Council Canada;
# see above for an up-to-date link.

# From Chris Walton (2007-03-01):
# ... the community of Resolute (located on Cornwallis Island in
# Nunavut) moved from Central Time to Eastern Time last November.
# Basically the community did not change its clocks at the end of
# daylight saving....
# http://www.nnsl.com/frames/newspapers/2006-11/nov13_06none.html

# From Chris Walton (2011-03-21):
# Back in 2007 I initiated the creation of a new "zone file" for Resolute
# Bay. Resolute Bay is a small community located about 900km north of
# the Arctic Circle. The zone file was required because Resolute Bay had
# decided to use UTC-5 instead of UTC-6 for the winter of 2006-2007.
#
# According to new information which I received last week, Resolute Bay
# went back to using UTC-6 in the winter of 2007-2008...
#
# On March 11/2007 most of Canada went onto daylight saving. On March
# 14/2007 I phoned the Resolute Bay hamlet office to do a "time check." I
# talked to somebody that was both knowledgeable and helpful. I was able
# to confirm that Resolute Bay was still operating on UTC-5. It was
# explained to me that Resolute Bay had been on the Eastern Time zone
# (EST) in the winter, and was now back on the Central Time zone (CDT).
# i.e. the time zone had changed twice in the last year but the clocks
# had not moved. The residents had to know which time zone they were in
# so they could follow the correct TV schedule...
#
# On Nov 02/2008 most of Canada went onto standard time. On Nov 03/2008 I
# phoned the Resolute Bay hamlet office...[D]ue to the challenging nature
# of the phone call, I decided to seek out an alternate source of
# information. I found an e-mail address for somebody by the name of
# Stephanie Adams whose job was listed as "Inns North Support Officer for
# Arctic Co-operatives." I was under the impression that Stephanie lived
# and worked in Resolute Bay...
#
# On March 14/2011 I phoned the hamlet office again. I was told that
# Resolute Bay had been using Central Standard Time over the winter of
# 2010-2011 and that the clocks had therefore been moved one hour ahead
# on March 13/2011. The person I talked to was aware that Resolute Bay
# had previously experimented with Eastern Standard Time but he could not
# tell me when the practice had stopped.
#
# On March 17/2011 I searched the Web to find an e-mail address of
# somebody that might be able to tell me exactly when Resolute Bay went
# off Eastern Standard Time. I stumbled on the name "Aziz Kheraj." Aziz
# used to be the mayor of Resolute Bay and he apparently owns half the
# businesses including "South Camp Inn." This website has some info on
# Aziz:
# http://www.uphere.ca/node/493
#
# I sent Aziz an e-mail asking when Resolute Bay had stopped using
# Eastern Standard Time.
#
# Aziz responded quickly with this: "hi, The time was not changed for the
# 1 year only, the following year, the community went back to the old way
# of "spring ahead-fall behind" currently we are zulu plus 5 hrs and in
# the winter Zulu plus 6 hrs"
#
# This of course conflicted with everything I had ascertained in November 2008.
#
# I sent Aziz a copy of my 2008 e-mail exchange with Stephanie. Aziz
# responded with this: "Hi, Stephanie lives in Winnipeg. I live here, You
# may want to check with the weather office in Resolute Bay or do a
# search on the weather through Env. Canada. web site"
#
# If I had realized the Stephanie did not live in Resolute Bay I would
# never have contacted her.  I now believe that all the information I
# obtained in November 2008 should be ignored...
# I apologize for reporting incorrect information in 2008.

# Mexico

# From Paul Eggert (2014-12-07):
# The Investigation and Analysis Service of the
# Mexican Library of Congress (MLoC) has published a
# history of Mexican local time (in Spanish)
# http://www.diputados.gob.mx/bibliot/publica/inveyana/polisoc/horver/index.htm
#
# Here are the discrepancies between Shanks & Pottenger (S&P) and the MLoC.
# (In all cases we go with the MLoC.)
# S&P report that Baja was at -8:00 in 1922/1923.
# S&P say the 1930 transition in Baja was 1930-11-16.
# S&P report no DST during summer 1931.
# S&P report a transition at 1932-03-30 23:00, not 1932-04-01.

# From Gwillim Law (2001-02-20):
# There are some other discrepancies between the Decrees page and the
# tz database.  I think they can best be explained by supposing that
# the researchers who prepared the Decrees page failed to find some of
# the relevant documents.

# From Alan Perry (1996-02-15):
# A guy from our Mexico subsidiary finally found the Presidential Decree
# outlining the timezone changes in Mexico.
#
# ------------- Begin Forwarded Message -------------
#
# I finally got my hands on the Official Presidential Decree that sets up the
# rules for the DST changes. The rules are:
#
# 1. The country is divided in 3 timezones:
#    - Baja California Norte (the Mexico/BajaNorte TZ)
#    - Baja California Sur, Nayarit, Sinaloa and Sonora (the Mexico/BajaSur TZ)
#    - The rest of the country (the Mexico/General TZ)
#
# 2. From the first Sunday in April at 2:00 AM to the last Sunday in October
#    at 2:00 AM, the times in each zone are as follows:
#    BajaNorte: GMT+7
#    BajaSur:   GMT+6
#    General:   GMT+5
#
# 3. The rest of the year, the times are as follows:
#    BajaNorte: GMT+8
#    BajaSur:   GMT+7
#    General:   GMT+6
#
# The Decree was published in Mexico's Official Newspaper on January 4th.
#
# -------------- End Forwarded Message --------------
# From Paul Eggert (1996-06-12):
# For an English translation of the decree, see
# "Diario Oficial: Time Zone Changeover" (1996-01-04).
# http://mexico-travel.com/extra/timezone_eng.html

# From Rives McDow (1998-10-08):
# The State of Quintana Roo has reverted back to central STD and DST times
# (i.e. UTC -0600 and -0500 as of 1998-08-02).

# From Rives McDow (2000-01-10):
# Effective April 4, 1999 at 2:00 AM local time, Sonora changed to the time
# zone 5 hours from the International Date Line, and will not observe daylight
# savings time so as to stay on the same time zone as the southern part of
# Arizona year round.

# From Jesper Nørgaard, translating
# <http://www.reforma.com/nacional/articulo/064327/> (2001-01-17):
# In Oaxaca, the 55.000 teachers from the Section 22 of the National
# Syndicate of Education Workers, refuse to apply daylight saving each
# year, so that the more than 10,000 schools work at normal hour the
# whole year.

# From Gwillim Law (2001-01-19):
# <http://www.reforma.com/negocios_y_dinero/articulo/064481/> ... says
# (translated):...
# January 17, 2000 - The Energy Secretary, Ernesto Martens, announced
# that Summer Time will be reduced from seven to five months, starting
# this year....
# http://www.publico.com.mx/scripts/texto3.asp?action=pagina&pag=21&pos=p&secc=naci&date=01/17/2001
# [translated], says "summer time will ... take effect on the first Sunday
# in May, and end on the last Sunday of September.

# From Arthur David Olson (2001-01-25):
# The 2001-01-24 traditional Washington Post contained the page one
# story "Timely Issue Divides Mexicans."...
# http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A37383-2001Jan23.html
# ... Mexico City Mayor López Obrador "...is threatening to keep
# Mexico City and its 20 million residents on a different time than
# the rest of the country..." In particular, López Obrador would abolish
# observation of Daylight Saving Time.

# Official statute published by the Energy Department
# http://www.conae.gob.mx/ahorro/decretohorver2001.html#decre
# (2001-02-01) shows Baja and Chihauhua as still using US DST rules,
# and Sonora with no DST.  This was reported by Jesper Nørgaard (2001-02-03).

# From Paul Eggert (2001-03-03):
#
# http://www.latimes.com/news/nation/20010303/t000018766.html
# James F. Smith writes in today's LA Times
# * Sonora will continue to observe standard time.
# * Last week Mexico City's mayor Andrés Manuel López Obrador decreed that
#   the Federal District will not adopt DST.
# * 4 of 16 district leaders announced they'll ignore the decree.
# * The decree does not affect federal-controlled facilities including
#   the airport, banks, hospitals, and schools.
#
# For now we'll assume that the Federal District will bow to federal rules.

# From Jesper Nørgaard (2001-04-01):
# I found some references to the Mexican application of daylight
# saving, which modifies what I had already sent you, stating earlier
# that a number of northern Mexican states would go on daylight
# saving. The modification reverts this to only cover Baja California
# (Norte), while all other states (except Sonora, who has no daylight
# saving all year) will follow the original decree of president
# Vicente Fox, starting daylight saving May 6, 2001 and ending
# September 30, 2001.

# From Reuters (2001-09-04):
# Mexico's Supreme Court on Tuesday declared that daylight savings was
# unconstitutional in Mexico City, creating the possibility the
# capital will be in a different time zone from the rest of the nation
# next year....  The Supreme Court's ruling takes effect at 2:00
# a.m. (0800 GMT) on Sept. 30, when Mexico is scheduled to revert to
# standard time. "This is so residents of the Federal District are not
# subject to unexpected time changes," a statement from the court said.

# From Jesper Nørgaard Welen (2002-03-12):
# ... consulting my local grocery store(!) and my coworkers, they all insisted
# that a new decision had been made to reinstate US style DST in Mexico....
# http://www.conae.gob.mx/ahorro/horaver2001_m1_2002.html (2002-02-20)
# confirms this.  Sonora as usual is the only state where DST is not applied.

# Steffen Thorsen wrote:
# > Mexico's House of Representatives has approved a proposal for northern

# From Paul Eggert (2006-03-22):
# Formerly there was an America/Ensenada zone, which differed from
# America/Tijuana only in that it did not observe DST from 1976
# through 1995.  This was as per Shanks (1999).  But Shanks & Pottenger say
# Ensenada did not observe DST from 1948 through 1975.  Guy Harris reports
# that the 1987 OAG says "Only Ensenada, Mexicali, San Felipe and
# Tijuana observe DST," which agrees with Shanks & Pottenger but implies that
# DST-observance was a town-by-town matter back then.  This concerns
# data after 1970 so most likely there should be at least one Zone
# other than America/Tijuana for Baja, but it's not clear yet what its

# Milne gives -5:28:50.45 for the observatory at Havana, -5:29:23.57
# for the port, and -5:30 for meteorological observations.
# For now, stick with Shanks & Pottenger.

# From Arthur David Olson (1999-03-29):
# The 1999-03-28 exhibition baseball game held in Havana, Cuba, between
# the Cuban National Team and the Baltimore Orioles was carried live on
# the Orioles Radio Network, including affiliate WTOP in Washington, DC.
# During the game, play-by-play announcer Jim Hunter noted that
# "We'll be losing two hours of sleep...Cuba switched to Daylight Saving
# Time today."  (The "two hour" remark referred to losing one hour of
# sleep on 1999-03-28 - when the announcers were in Cuba as it switched
# to DST - and one more hour on 1999-04-04 - when the announcers will have
# returned to Baltimore, which switches on that date.)

# From Steffen Thorsen (2013-11-11):
# DST start in Cuba in 2004 ... does not follow the same rules as the
# years before.  The correct date should be Sunday 2004-03-28 00:00 ...

# From Evert van der Veer via Steffen Thorsen (2004-10-28):

# From Paul Eggert (2006-03-22):
# http://www.granma.cu/ingles/2004/septiembre/juev30/41medid-i.html
# says that it's due to a problem at the Antonio Guiteras
# thermoelectric plant, and says "This October there will be no return
# to normal hours (after daylight saving time)".
# For now, let's assume that it's a temporary measure.

# From Carlos A. Carnero Delgado (2005-11-12):
# This year (just like in 2004-2005) there's no change in time zone
# adjustment in Cuba.  We will stay in daylight saving time:
# http://www.granma.cu/espanol/2005/noviembre/mier9/horario.html

# the 3 years of permanent DST next weekend, see
# http://www.granma.cu/ingles/2006/octubre/lun16/43horario.html
# "On Saturday night, October 28 going into Sunday, October 29, at 01:00,

# From Arthur David Olson (2008-03-09):
# I'm in Maryland which is now observing United States Eastern Daylight
# Time. At 9:44 local time I used RealPlayer to listen to
# http://media.enet.cu/radioreloj
# a Cuban information station, and heard
# the time announced as "ocho cuarenta y cuatro" ("eight forty-four"),
# indicating that Cuba is still on standard time.

# From Steffen Thorsen (2008-03-12):
# It seems that Cuba will start DST on Sunday, 2007-03-16...
# It was announced yesterday, according to this source (in Spanish):
# http://www.nnc.cubaweb.cu/marzo-2008/cien-1-11-3-08.htm
#
# Some more background information is posted here:
# http://www.timeanddate.com/news/time/cuba-starts-dst-march-16.html
#
# The article also says that Cuba has been observing DST since 1963,
# while Shanks (and tzdata) has 1965 as the first date (except in the
# 1940's). Many other web pages in Cuba also claim that it has been
# observed since 1963, but with the exception of 1970 - an exception
# which is not present in tzdata/Shanks. So there is a chance we need to
# change some historic records as well.
#
# One example:
# http://www.radiohc.cu/espanol/noticias/mar07/11mar/hor.htm

# From Jesper Nørgaard Welen (2008-03-13):
# The Cuban time change has just been confirmed on the most authoritative
# web site, the Granma.  Please check out
# http://www.granma.cubaweb.cu/2008/03/13/nacional/artic10.html
#
# Basically as expected after Steffen Thorsen's information, the change
# will take place midnight between Saturday and Sunday.

# From Arthur David Olson (2008-03-12):
# Assume Sun>=15 (third Sunday) going forward.

# From Alexander Krivenyshev (2009-03-04)
# According to the Radio Reloj - Cuba will start Daylight Saving Time on
# midnight between Saturday, March 07, 2009 and Sunday, March 08, 2009-
# not on midnight March 14 / March 15 as previously thought.

# I listened over the Internet to

# this morning; when it was 10:05 a. m. here in Bethesda, Maryland the
# the time was announced as "diez cinco" - the same time as here, indicating
# that has indeed switched to DST. Assume second Sunday from 2009 forward.

# From Steffen Thorsen (2011-03-08):
# Granma announced that Cuba is going to start DST on 2011-03-20 00:00:00

# Haiti
# From Gwillim Law (2005-04-15):
# Risto O. Nykänen wrote me that Haiti is now on DST.
# I searched for confirmation, and I found a press release
# on the Web page of the Haitian Consulate in Chicago (2005-03-31),
# <http://www.haitianconsulate.org/time.doc>.  Translated from French, it says:
#
#  "The Prime Minister's Communication Office notifies the public in general
#   and the press in particular that, following a decision of the Interior
#   Ministry and the Territorial Collectivities [I suppose that means the
#   provinces], Haiti will move to Eastern Daylight Time in the night from next
#   Saturday the 2nd to Sunday the 3rd.
#
#  "Consequently, the Prime Minister's Communication Office wishes to inform
#   the population that the country's clocks will be set forward one hour
#   starting at midnight.  This provision will hold until the last Saturday in
#   October 2005.
#
#  "Port-au-Prince, March 31, 2005"
#
# From Steffen Thorsen (2006-04-04):
# I have been informed by users that Haiti observes DST this year like
# last year, so the current "only" rule for 2005 might be changed to a
# "max" rule or to last until 2006. (Who knows if they will observe DST
# next year or if they will extend their DST like US/Canada next year).
#
# I have found this article about it (in French):
# http://www.haitipressnetwork.com/news.cfm?articleID=7612
#
# The reason seems to be an energy crisis.

# From Stephen Colebourne (2007-02-22):
# Some IATA info: Haiti won't be having DST in 2007.

# From Steffen Thorsen (2012-03-11):
# According to several news sources, Haiti will observe DST this year,
# apparently using the same start and end date as USA/Canada.
# So this means they have already changed their time.
#
# http://www.alterpresse.org/spip.php?article12510
# http://radiovision2000haiti.net/home/?p=13253
#
# From Arthur David Olson (2012-03-11):
# The alterpresse.org source seems to show a US-style leap from 2:00 a.m. to
# 3:00 a.m. rather than the traditional Haitian jump at midnight.
# Assume a US-style fall back as well.

# From Steffen Thorsen (2013-03-10):
# It appears that Haiti is observing DST this year as well, same rules
# as US/Canada.  They did it last year as well, and it looks like they
# are going to observe DST every year now...

# worldtimezone.com reports a 2006-05-02 Spanish-language AP article
# saying Honduras will start using DST midnight Saturday, effective 4
# months until September.  La Tribuna reported today
# <http://www.latribuna.hn/99299.html> that Manuel Zelaya, the president
# of Honduras, refused to back down on this.

# From Jesper Nørgaard Welen (2006-08-08):
# It seems that Honduras has returned from DST to standard time this Monday at
# 00:00 hours (prolonging Sunday to 25 hours duration).
# http://www.worldtimezone.com/dst_news/dst_news_honduras04.html

# From Paul Eggert (2006-08-08):
# Also see Diario El Heraldo, The country returns to standard time (2006-08-08).
# http://www.elheraldo.hn/nota.php?nid=54941&sec=12
# It mentions executive decree 18-2006.

# From Steffen Thorsen (2006-08-17):
# Honduras will observe DST from 2007 to 2009, exact dates are not
# published, I have located this authoritative source:

# From Steffen Thorsen (2007-03-30):
# http://www.laprensahn.com/pais_nota.php?id04962=7386
# So it seems that Honduras will not enter DST this year....

#
# From Steffen Thorsen (2005-04-12):

# Some background information is available on the President's official site:

#
# From Paul Eggert (2005-05-01):
# The decree doesn't say anything about daylight saving, but for now let's
# assume that it is daylight saving....
#
# From Gwillim Law (2005-04-21):
# The Associated Press story on the time change, which can be found at
# http://www.lapalmainteractivo.com/guias/content/gen/ap/America_Latina/AMC_GEN_NICARAGUA_HORA.html
# and elsewhere, says (fifth paragraph, translated from Spanish): "The last
# time that a change of clocks was applied to save energy was in the year 2000
# during the Arnoldo Alemán administration."...
# The northamerica file says that Nicaragua has been on UTC-6 continuously
# since December 1998.  I wasn't able to find any details of Nicaraguan time
# changes in 2000.  Perhaps a note could be added to the northamerica file, to
# the effect that we have indirect evidence that DST was observed in 2000.
#
# From Jesper Nørgaard Welen (2005-11-02):
# Nicaragua left DST the 2005-10-02 at 00:00 (local time).

# From Paul Eggert (2006-07-09):
# Chris Walton (2006-07-06) mentioned an article by Stephanie MacLellan in the
# 2005-07-21 Chronicle-Journal, which said:
#
#	The clocks in Atikokan stay set on standard time year-round.
#	This means they spend about half the time on central time and
#	the other half on eastern time.
#
#	For the most part, the system works, Mayor Dennis Brown said.
#
#	"The majority of businesses in Atikokan deal more with Eastern
#	Canada, but there are some that deal with Western Canada," he
#	said.  "I don't see any changes happening here."
#
# Walton also writes "Supposedly Pickle Lake and Mishkeegogamang
# [New Osnaburgh] follow the same practice."

# From Garry McKinnon (2006-07-14) via Chris Walton:
# I chatted with a member of my board who has an outstanding memory
# and a long history in Atikokan (and in the telecom industry) and he
# can say for certain that Atikokan has been practicing the current
# time keeping since 1952, at least.

# From Paul Eggert (2006-07-17):
# Shanks & Pottenger say that Atikokan has agreed with Rainy River
# ever since standard time was introduced, but the information from
# McKinnon sounds more authoritative.  For now, assume that Atikokan
# switched to EST immediately after WWII era daylight saving time
# ended.  This matches the old (less-populous) America/Coral_Harbour
# entry since our cutoff date of 1970, so we can move
# America/Coral_Harbour to the 'backward' file.

# From Rob Douglas (2006-04-06):
# the old Manitoba Time Act - as amended by Bill 2, assented to
# March 27, 1987 ... said ...
# "between two o'clock Central Standard Time in the morning of
# the first Sunday of April of each year and two o'clock Central
# Standard Time in the morning of the last Sunday of October next
# following, one hour in advance of Central Standard Time."...
# I believe that the English legislation [of the old time act] had =
# been assented to (March 22, 1967)....
# Also, as far as I can tell, there was no order-in-council varying
# the time of Daylight Saving Time for 2005 and so the provisions of
# the 1987 version would apply - the changeover was at 2:00 Central
# Standard Time (i.e. not until 3:00 Central Daylight Time).

# From Paul Eggert (2006-04-10):
# Shanks & Pottenger say Manitoba switched at 02:00 (not 02:00s)
# starting 1966.  Since 02:00s is clearly correct for 1967 on, assume
# it was also 02:00s in 1966.

# From Paul Eggert (2006-07-09):
# Chris Walton (2006-07-06) mentioned an article by Stephanie MacLellan in the
# 2005-07-21 Chronicle-Journal, which said:
#
#	The clocks in Atikokan stay set on standard time year-round.
#	This means they spend about half the time on central time and
#	the other half on eastern time.
#
#	For the most part, the system works, Mayor Dennis Brown said.
#
#	"The majority of businesses in Atikokan deal more with Eastern
#	Canada, but there are some that deal with Western Canada," he
#	said.  "I don't see any changes happening here."
#
# Walton also writes "Supposedly Pickle Lake and Mishkeegogamang
# [New Osnaburgh] follow the same practice."

# From Garry McKinnon (2006-07-14) via Chris Walton:
# I chatted with a member of my board who has an outstanding memory
# and a long history in Atikokan (and in the telecom industry) and he

# From Paul Eggert (2006-07-17):
# Shanks & Pottenger say that Atikokan has agreed with Rainy River
# ever since standard time was introduced, but the information from
# McKinnon sounds more authoritative.  For now, assume that Atikokan
# switched to EST immediately after WWII era daylight saving time
# ended.  This matches the old (less-populous) America/Coral_Harbour
# entry since our cutoff date of 1970, so we can move
# America/Coral_Harbour to the 'backward' file.

# From Rob Douglas (2006-04-06):
# the old Manitoba Time Act - as amended by Bill 2, assented to
# March 27, 1987 ... said ...
# "between two o'clock Central Standard Time in the morning of
# the first Sunday of April of each year and two o'clock Central
# Standard Time in the morning of the last Sunday of October next
# following, one hour in advance of Central Standard Time."...
# I believe that the English legislation [of the old time act] had =
# been assented to (March 22, 1967)....
# Also, as far as I can tell, there was no order-in-council varying
# the time of Daylight Saving Time for 2005 and so the provisions of
# the 1987 version would apply - the changeover was at 2:00 Central
# Standard Time (i.e. not until 3:00 Central Daylight Time).

# From Paul Eggert (2006-04-10):
# Shanks & Pottenger say Manitoba switched at 02:00 (not 02:00s)
# starting 1966.  Since 02:00s is clearly correct for 1967 on, assume
# it was also 02:00s in 1966.

# Gwillim Law reports this source for daylight saving time in Mexico:
# <a href="http://www.spin.com.mx/verano/">
# Daylight saving time * SPIN-Internet (in Spanish)
# </a>
# Law (2000-03-09) translates it as follows:
#
# Standard time effective in Mexico takes its origin in the
# presidential decree of April 24, 1942.  The time of the 120th
# meridian applies to the state of Baja California; of the 105th
# meridian to the states of Baja California Sur, Sonora, Sinaloa, and
# Nayarit; and the time of the 90th meridian to the rest of the
# country.
#
# In the country, there have been several attempts made to adapt
# standard time with the object of arriving at a better use of
# daylight for social and economic activities.  In December, 1981 a
# permanent time zone was decreed for the states of Campeche, Yucatan,
# and Quintana Roo, displacing them from the 90th to the 75th
# meridian.  This disposition was annulled on December 2, 1982.
#
# In 1988 a Summer Time was established for the states of Tamaulipas,
# Nuevo Leon, Coahuila, and Durango, which meant that from the first
# Sunday in April to the last [Sunday] of October those states
# displaced their time from the 90th to the 75th meridian.  That
# disposition lasted for one year.

# Which parts did not observe DST is hard to pinpoint but most of the
# province follows the rules.
# NOTE: those that didn't have DST for that rule, also
# probably did not have it for several years previous.

# From U. S. Naval Observatory (January 19, 1989):
# CANADA   NEW FDL    3.5H BEHIND UTC    ST.JOHN'S
# CANADA   NEW FDL    1.5H BEHIND UTC    APR 3 - OCT 29

# CANADA   PACIFIC    7 H  BEHIND UTC    APR 3 - OCT 29
# CANADA   YUKON      SAME AS PACIFIC    DAWSON

# From Arthur David Olson (January 21, 1989):
# April 3 fell on a Sunday in 1988; October 29 fell on a Sunday in 1989.  Ahem.
# Note claim that there's double DST in Newfoundland and that Yukon should
# be same as Pacific.

# From W. Jones (jones@@skdad.usask.ca) (November 6, 1992):
# The. . .below is based on information I got from our law library, the
# provincial archives, and the provincial Community Services department.
# A precise history would require digging through newspaper archives, and
# since you didn't say what you wanted, I didn't bother.
#
# Saskatchewan is split by a time zone meridian (105W) and over the years
# the boundary became pretty ragged as communities near it reevaluated
# their affiliations in one direction or the other.  In 1965 a provincial
# referendum favoured legislating common time practices.
#
# On 15 April 1966 the Time Act (c. T-14, Revised Statutes of
# Saskatchewan 1978) was proclaimed, and established that the eastern
# part of Saskatchewan would use CST year round, that districts in
# northwest Saskatchewan would by default follow CST but could opt to
# follow Mountain Time rules (thus 1 hour difference in the winter and
# zero in the summer), and that districts in southwest Saskatchewan would
# by default follow MT but could opt to follow CST.
#
# It took a few years for the dust to settle (I know one story of a town
# on one time zone having its school in another, such that a mom had to
# serve her family lunch in two shifts), but presently it seems that only
# a few towns on the border with Alberta (e.g. Lloydminster) follow MT
# rules any more; all other districts appear to have used CST year round
# since sometime in the 1960s.
#
# Here's how I would summarize things.  Establish a "Saskatchewan" CST
# time zone, and note that it officially exists as of 15 April 1966.  Any
# current exceptions can put themselves in the "Mountain" zone, since
# those are the rules they follow.  Any past exceptions can be forgotten,
# since that's what those who live here have done.

# From Arthur David Olson (November 21, 1992):
# East-Saskatchewan kept to avoid problems for folks using that zone by name;
# plain Saskatchewan added.
