# Queensland
#
# From Alex Livingston (1996-11-01):
# I have heard or read more than once that some resort islands off the coast
# of Queensland chose to keep observing daylight-saving time even after
# Queensland ceased to.
#
# From Paul Eggert (1996-11-22):
# IATA SSIM (1993-02/1994-09) say that the Holiday Islands (Hayman, Lindeman,
# Hamilton) observed DST for two years after the rest of Queensland stopped.
# Hamilton is the largest, but there is also a Hamilton in Victoria,
# so use Lindeman.
#
# From J William Piggott (2016-02-20):
# There is no location named Holiday Islands in Queensland Australia; holiday
# islands is a colloquial term used globally.  Hayman and Lindeman are at the
# north and south extremes of the Whitsunday Islands archipelago, and
# Hamilton is in between; it is reasonable to believe that this time zone
# applies to all of the Whitsundays.

# From Alexander Krivenyshev (2009-11-10):
# According to Fiji Broadcasting Corporation,  Fiji plans to re-introduce DST
# from November 29th 2009  to April 25th 2010.
#
# "Daylight savings to commence this month"
# http://www.radiofiji.com.fj/fullstory.php?id=23719

# From Steffen Thorsen (2009-11-10):

# http://www.fiji.gov.fj/publish/page_16198.shtml

# From Steffen Thorsen (2010-03-03):
# The Cabinet in Fiji has decided to end DST about a month early, on

# From Alexander Krivenyshev (2010-10-24):
# According to Radio Fiji and Fiji Times online, Fiji will end DST 3
# weeks earlier than expected - on March 6, 2011, not March 27, 2011...
# Here is confirmation from Government of the Republic of the Fiji Islands,

# From Steffen Thorsen (2011-10-03):
# Now the dates have been confirmed, and at least our start date

#
# http://www.fiji.gov.fj/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=4966:daylight-saving-starts-in-fiji&catid=71:press-releases&Itemid=155

# Members of the public are reminded to change their time to one hour in
# advance at 2am to 3am on October 23, 2011 and one hour back at 3am to
# 2am on February 26 next year.

# From Ken Rylander (2011-10-24)
# Another change to the Fiji DST end date. In the TZ database the end date for
# Fiji DST 2012, is currently Feb 26. This has been changed to Jan 22.
#
# http://www.fiji.gov.fj/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=5017:amendments-to-daylight-savings&catid=71:press-releases&Itemid=155
# states:
#
# The end of daylight saving scheduled initially for the 26th of February 2012
# has been brought forward to the 22nd of January 2012.
# The commencement of daylight saving will remain unchanged and start
# on the  23rd of October, 2011.

# From the Fiji Government Online Portal (2012-08-21) via Steffen Thorsen:
# The Minister for Labour, Industrial Relations and Employment Mr Jone Usamate
# today confirmed that Fiji will start daylight savings at 2 am on Sunday 21st
# October 2012 and end at 3 am on Sunday 20th January 2013.
# http://www.fiji.gov.fj/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=6702&catid=71&Itemid=155

# From the Fijian Government Media Center (2013-08-30) via David Wheeler:
# Fiji will start daylight savings on Sunday 27th October, 2013 ...
# move clocks forward by one hour from 2am
# http://www.fiji.gov.fj/Media-Center/Press-Releases/DAYLIGHT-SAVING-STARTS-ON-SUNDAY,-27th-OCTOBER-201.aspx

# From Steffen Thorsen (2013-01-10):
# Fiji will end DST on 2014-01-19 02:00:
# http://www.fiji.gov.fj/Media-Center/Press-Releases/DAYLIGHT-SAVINGS-TO-END-THIS-MONTH-%281%29.aspx

# From Ken Rylander (2014-10-20):
# DST will start Nov. 2 this year.
# http://www.fiji.gov.fj/Media-Center/Press-Releases/DAYLIGHT-SAVING-STARTS-ON-SUNDAY,-NOVEMBER-2ND.aspx

# From a government order dated 2015-08-26 and published as Legal Notice No. 77
# in the Government of Fiji Gazette Supplement No. 24 (2015-08-28),
# via Ken Rylander (2015-09-02):
# the daylight saving period is 1 hour in advance of the standard time
# commencing at 2.00 am on Sunday 1st November, 2015 and ending at
# 3.00 am on Sunday 17th January, 2016.

# From Raymond Kumar (2016-10-04):
# http://www.fiji.gov.fj/Media-Center/Press-Releases/DAYLIGHT-SAVING-STARTS-ON-6th-NOVEMBER,-2016.aspx
# "Fiji's daylight savings will begin on Sunday, 6 November 2016, when
# clocks go forward an hour at 2am to 3am....  Daylight Saving will
# end at 3.00am on Sunday 15th January 2017."

# From Paul Eggert (2016-10-03):
# For now, guess DST from 02:00 the first Sunday in November to
# 03:00 the third Sunday in January.  Although ad hoc, it matches
# transitions since late 2014 and seems more likely to match future
# practice than guessing no DST.

# Base the Bougainville entry on the Arawa-Kieta region, which appears to have
# the most people even though it was devastated in the Bougainville Civil War.
#
# Although Shanks gives 1942-03-15 / 1943-11-01 for UT +09, these dates
# are apparently rough guesswork from the starts of military campaigns.
# The World War II entries below are instead based on Arawa-Kieta.
# The Japanese occupied Kieta in July 1942,
# according to the Pacific War Online Encyclopedia
# http://pwencycl.kgbudge.com/B/o/Bougainville.htm
# and seem to have controlled it until their 1945-08-21 surrender.

# US minor outlying islands

# Howland, Baker
# Howland was mined for guano by American companies 1857-1878 and British
# 1886-1891; Baker was similar but exact dates are not known.
# Inhabited by civilians 1935-1942; U.S. military bases 1943-1944;
# uninhabited thereafter.
# Howland observed Hawaii Standard Time (UT -10:30) in 1937;
# see page 206 of Elgen M. Long and Marie K. Long,
# Amelia Earhart: the Mystery Solved, Simon & Schuster (2000).
# So most likely Howland and Baker observed Hawaii Time from 1935

# Johnston
#
# From Paul Eggert (2017-02-10):
# Sometimes Johnston kept Hawaii time, and sometimes it was an hour behind.
# Details are uncertain.  We have no data for Johnston after 1970, so
# treat it like Hawaii for now.  Since Johnston is now uninhabited,
# its link to Pacific/Honolulu is in the 'backward' file.
#
# In his memoirs of June 6th to October 4, 1945
# <http://www.315bw.org/Herb_Bach.htm> (2005), Herbert C. Bach writes,
# "We started our letdown to Kwajalein Atoll and landed there at 5:00 AM
# Johnston time, 1:30 AM Kwajalein time."  This was in June 1945, and
# confirms that Johnston kept the same time as Honolulu in summer 1945.
#
# From Lyle McElhaney (2014-03-11):
# [W]hen JI was being used for that [atomic bomb] testing, the time being used
# was not Hawaiian time but rather the same time being used on the ships,
# which had a GMT offset of -11 hours.  This apparently applied to at least the
# time from Operation Newsreel (Hardtack I/Teak shot, 1958-08-01) to the last
# Operation Fishbowl shot (Tightrope, 1962-11-04).... [See] Herman Hoerlin,

# http://www.fas.org/sgp/othergov/doe/lanl/docs1/00322994.pdf

# Australia

# From Paul Eggert (2014-06-30):
# Daylight saving time has long been controversial in Australia, pitting
# region against region, rural against urban, and local against global.
# For example, in her review of Graeme Davison's _The Unforgiving
# Minute: how Australians learned to tell the time_ (1993), Perth native
# Phillipa J Martyr wrote, "The section entitled 'Saving Daylight' was
# very informative, but was (as can, sadly, only be expected from a
# Melbourne-based study) replete with the usual chuckleheaded
# Queenslanders and straw-chewing yokels from the West prattling fables
# about fading curtains and crazed farm animals."
# Electronic Journal of Australian and New Zealand History (1997-03-03)
# http://www.jcu.edu.au/aff/history/reviews/davison.htm

# From Paul Eggert (2005-12-08):
# Implementation Dates of Daylight Saving Time within Australia
# http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/averages/tables/dst_times.shtml
# summarizes daylight saving issues in Australia.

# From Arthur David Olson (2005-12-12):
# Lawlink NSW:Daylight Saving in New South Wales
# http://www.lawlink.nsw.gov.au/lawlink/Corporate/ll_agdinfo.nsf/pages/community_relations_daylight_saving
# covers New South Wales in particular.

# From John Mackin (1991-03-06):
# We in Australia have _never_ referred to DST as 'daylight' time.
# It is called 'summer' time.  Now by a happy coincidence, 'summer'
# and 'standard' happen to start with the same letter; hence, the
# abbreviation does _not_ change...
# The legislation does not actually define abbreviations, at least
# in this State, but the abbreviation is just commonly taken to be the
# initials of the phrase, and the legislation here uniformly uses
# the phrase 'summer time' and does not use the phrase 'daylight
# time'.
# Announcers on the Commonwealth radio network, the ABC (for Australian
# Broadcasting Commission), use the phrases 'Eastern Standard Time'
# or 'Eastern Summer Time'.  (Note, though, that as I say in the
# current australasia file, there is really no such thing.)  Announcers
# on its overseas service, Radio Australia, use the same phrases
# prefixed by the word 'Australian' when referring to local times;
# time announcements on that service, naturally enough, are made in UTC.

# From Paul Eggert (2014-06-30):
#
# Inspired by Mackin's remarks quoted above, earlier versions of this
# file used "EST" for both Eastern Standard Time and Eastern Summer
# Time in Australia, and similarly for "CST", "CWST", and "WST".
# However, these abbreviations were confusing and were not common
# practice among Australians, and there were justifiable complaints
# about them, so I attempted to survey current Australian usage.
# For the tz database, the full English phrase is not that important;
# what matters is the abbreviation.  It's difficult to survey the web
# directly for abbreviation usage, as there are so many false hits for
# strings like "EST" and "EDT", so I looked for pages that defined an
# abbreviation for eastern or central DST in Australia, and got the
# following numbers of unique hits for the listed Google queries:
#
#   10 "Eastern Daylight Time AEST" site:au [some are false hits]
#   10 "Eastern Summer Time AEST" site:au
#   10 "Summer Time AEDT" site:au
#   13 "EDST Eastern Daylight Saving Time" site:au
#   18 "Summer Time ESST" site:au
#   28 "Eastern Daylight Saving Time EDST" site:au
#   39 "EDT Eastern Daylight Time" site:au [some are false hits]
#   53 "Eastern Daylight Time EDT" site:au [some are false hits]
#   54 "AEDT Australian Eastern Daylight Time" site:au
#  182 "Eastern Daylight Time AEDT" site:au
#
#   17 "Central Daylight Time CDT" site:au [some are false hits]
#   46 "Central Daylight Time ACDT" site:au
#
# I tried several other variants (e.g., "Eastern Summer Time EST") but
# they all returned fewer than 10 unique hits.  I also looked for pages
# mentioning both "western standard time" and an abbreviation, since
# there is no WST in the US to generate false hits, and found:
#
#  156 "western standard time" AWST site:au
#  226 "western standard time" WST site:au
#
# I then surveyed the top ten newspapers in Australia by circulation as
# listed in Wikipedia, using Google queries like "AEDT site:heraldsun.com.au"
# and obtaining estimated counts from the initial page of search results.
# All ten papers greatly preferred "AEDT" to "EDT".  The papers
# surveyed were the Herald Sun, The Daily Telegraph, The Courier-Mail,
# The Sydney Morning Herald, The West Australian, The Age, The Advertiser,
# The Australian, The Financial Review, and The Herald (Newcastle).
#
# I also searched for historical usage, to see whether abbreviations
# like "AEDT" are new.  A Trove search <http://trove.nla.gov.au/>
# found only one newspaper (The Canberra Times) with a house style
# dating back to the 1970s, I expect because other newspapers weren't
# fully indexed.  The Canberra Times strongly preferred abbreviations
# like "AEDT".  The first occurrence of "AEDT" was a World Weather
# column (1971-11-17, page 24), and of "ACDT" was a Scoreboard column
# (1993-01-24, p 16).  The style was the typical usage but was not
# strictly enforced; for example, "Welcome to the twilight zones ..."
# (1994-10-29, p 1) uses the abbreviations AEST/AEDT, CST/CDT, and
# WST, and goes on to say, "The confusion and frustration some feel
# about the lack of uniformity among Australia's six states and two
# territories has prompted one group to form its very own political
# party -- the Sydney-based Daylight Saving Extension Party."
#
# I also surveyed federal government sources.  They did not agree:
#
#   The Australian Government (2014-03-26)
#   http://australia.gov.au/about-australia/our-country/time
#   (This document was produced by the Department of Finance.)

#   Parliamentary Library (2008-11-10)
#   http://www.aph.gov.au/binaries/library/pubs/rp/2008-09/09rp14.pdf
#   EST CST WST preferred for standard time; AEST AEDT ACST ACDT also used
#
#   The Transport Safety Bureau has an extensive series of accident reports,
#   and investigators seem to use whatever abbreviation they like.
#   Googling site:atsb.gov.au found the following number of unique hits:
#   311 "ESuT", 195 "EDT", 26 "AEDT", 83 "CSuT", 46 "CDT".
#   "_SuT" tended to appear in older reports, and "A_DT" tended to
#   appear in reports of events with international implications.
#
# From the above it appears that there is a working consensus in
# Australia to use trailing "DT" for daylight saving time; although
# some sources use trailing "SST" or "ST" or "SuT" they are by far in
# the minority.  The case for leading "A" is weaker, but since it
# seems to be preferred in the overall web and is preferred in all
# the leading newspaper websites and in many government departments,
# it has a stronger case than omitting the leading "A".  The current
# version of the database therefore uses abbreviations like "AEST" and
# "AEDT" for Australian time zones.

# From Paul Eggert (1995-12-19):
# Shanks & Pottenger report 2:00 for all autumn changes in Australia and NZ.
# Mark Prior writes that his newspaper
# reports that NSW's fall 1995 change will occur at 2:00,
# but Robert Elz says it's been 3:00 in Victoria since 1970
# and perhaps the newspaper's '2:00' is referring to standard time.
# For now we'll continue to assume 2:00s for changes since 1960.

# From Rives McDow (2002-04-09):
# The most interesting region I have found consists of three towns on the
# southern coast....  South Australia observes daylight saving time; Western
# Australia does not.  The two states are one and a half hours apart.  The
# residents decided to forget about this nonsense of changing the clock so
# much and set the local time 20 hours and 45 minutes from the
# international date line, or right in the middle of the time of South
# Australia and Western Australia....
#
# From Paul Eggert (2002-04-09):
# This is confirmed by the section entitled
# "What's the deal with time zones???" in
# http://www.earthsci.unimelb.edu.au/~awatkins/null.html
#
# From Alex Livingston (2006-12-07):
# ... it was just on four years ago that I drove along the Eyre Highway,
# which passes through eastern Western Australia close to the southern
# coast of the continent.
#
# I paid particular attention to the time kept there. There can be no
# dispute that UTC+08:45 was considered "the time" from the border
# village just inside the border with South Australia to as far west
# as just east of Caiguna. There can also be no dispute that Eucla is
# the largest population centre in this zone....
#
# Now that Western Australia is observing daylight saving, the
# question arose whether this part of the state would follow suit. I
# just called the border village and confirmed that indeed they have,
# meaning that they are now observing UTC+09:45.
#
# (2006-12-09):
# I personally doubt that either experimentation with daylight saving
# in WA or its introduction in SA had anything to do with the genesis
# of this time zone.  My hunch is that it's been around since well
# before 1975.  I remember seeing it noted on road maps decades ago.

# From Paul Eggert (2006-12-15):
# For lack of better info, assume the tradition dates back to the
# introduction of standard time in 1895.

# From Scott Harrington (2001-08-29):
# On KQED's "City Arts and Lectures" program last night I heard an
# interesting story about daylight savings time.  Dr. John Heilbron was
# discussing his book "The Sun in the Church: Cathedrals as Solar
# Observatories"[1], and in particular the Shrine of Remembrance[2] located
# in Melbourne, Australia.
#
# Apparently the shrine's main purpose is a beam of sunlight which
# illuminates a special spot on the floor at the 11th hour of the 11th day
# of the 11th month (Remembrance Day) every year in memory of Australia's
# fallen WWI soldiers.  And if you go there on Nov. 11, at 11am local time,
# you will indeed see the sunbeam illuminate the special spot at the
# expected time.
#
# However, that is only because of some special mirror contraption that had
# to be employed, since due to daylight savings time, the true solar time of
# the remembrance moment occurs one hour later (or earlier?).  Perhaps
# someone with more information on this jury-rig can tell us more.

# New South Wales

# From Arthur David Olson:
# New South Wales and subjurisdictions have their own ideas of a fun time.
# Based on law library research by John Mackin,
# who notes:
#	In Australia, time is not legislated federally, but rather by the
#	individual states.  Thus, while such terms as "Eastern Standard Time"
#	[I mean, of course, Australian EST, not any other kind] are in common
#	use, _they have NO REAL MEANING_, as they are not defined in the
#	legislation.  This is very important to understand.
#	I have researched New South Wales time only...

# Lord Howe Island is located off the New South Wales coast, and is half an
# hour ahead of NSW time.

# From James Lonergan, Secretary, Lord Howe Island Board (2000-01-27):
# Lord Howe Island summer time in 2000/2001 will commence on the same
# date as the rest of NSW (i.e. 2000-08-27).  For your information the
# Lord Howe Island Board (controlling authority for the Island) is
# seeking the community's views on various options for summer time
# arrangements on the Island, e.g. advance clocks by 1 full hour
# instead of only 30 minutes.  [Dependent] on the wishes of residents
# the Board may approach the NSW government to change the existing
# arrangements.  The starting date for summer time on the Island will
# however always coincide with the rest of NSW.

# From James Lonergan, Secretary, Lord Howe Island Board (2000-10-25):
# Lord Howe Island advances clocks by 30 minutes during DST in NSW and retards
# clocks by 30 minutes when DST finishes. Since DST was most recently
# introduced in NSW, the "changeover" time on the Island has been 02:00 as
# shown on clocks on LHI. I guess this means that for 30 minutes at the start
# of DST, LHI is actually 1 hour ahead of the rest of NSW.

# From Paul Eggert (2006-03-22):
# For Lord Howe dates we use Shanks & Pottenger through 1989, and
# Lonergan thereafter.  For times we use Lonergan.

# From Paul Eggert (2007-07-23):
# See "southeast Australia" above for 2008 and later.

# From Steffen Thorsen (2009-04-28):
# According to the official press release, South Australia's extended daylight

# The extended daylight saving period that South Australia has been trialling

# According to Google Books snippet view, a speaker in the New Zealand

# http://www.norfolkisland.gov.nf/nia/MediaRelease/Media%20Release%20Norfolk%20Island%20Standard%20Time%20Change.pdf

# From Paul Eggert (2015-09-23):
# Transitions before 2015 are from timeanddate.com, which consulted
# the Norfolk Island Museum and the Australian Bureau of Meteorology's
# Norfolk Island station, and found no record of Norfolk observing DST
# other than in 1974/5.  See:
# http://www.timeanddate.com/time/australia/norfolk-island.html

# Pitcairn

# From Rives McDow (1999-11-08):
# A Proclamation was signed by the Governor of Pitcairn on the 27th March 1998
# with regard to Pitcairn Standard Time.  The Proclamation is as follows.
#
#	The local time for general purposes in the Islands shall be
#	Co-ordinated Universal time minus 8 hours and shall be known
#	as Pitcairn Standard Time.
#
# ... I have also seen Pitcairn listed as UTC minus 9 hours in several
# references, and can only assume that this was an error in interpretation
# somehow in light of this proclamation.

# From Rives McDow (1999-11-09):
# The Proclamation regarding Pitcairn time came into effect on 27 April 1998
# ... at midnight.

# From Howie Phelps (1999-11-10), who talked to a Pitcairner via shortwave:
# Betty Christian told me yesterday that their local time is the same as
# Pacific Standard Time. They used to be 1/2 hour different from us here in
# Sacramento but it was changed a couple of years ago.


# (Western) Samoa and American Samoa

# Howse writes (p 153, citing p 10 of the 1883-11-18 New York Herald)
# that in 1879 the King of Samoa decided to change
# "the date in his kingdom from the Antipodean to the American system,
# ordaining - by a masterpiece of diplomatic flattery - that
# the Fourth of July should be celebrated twice in that year."

# Although Shanks & Pottenger says they both switched to UT -11:30
# in 1911, and to -11 in 1950. many earlier sources give -11
# for American Samoa, e.g., the US National Bureau of Standards
# circular "Standard Time Throughout the World", 1932.
# Assume American Samoa switched to -11 in 1911, not 1950,
# and that after 1950 they agreed until (western) Samoa skipped a
# day in 2011.  Assume also that the Samoas follow the US and New
# Zealand's "ST"/"DT" style of daylight-saving abbreviations.

# Tonga

# From Paul Eggert (1996-01-22):
# Today's _Wall Street Journal_ (p 1) reports that "Tonga has been plotting
# to sneak ahead of [New Zealanders] by introducing daylight-saving time."
# Since Kiribati has moved the Date Line it's not clear what Tonga will do.

# Don Mundell writes in the 1997-02-20 Tonga Chronicle
# How Tonga became 'The Land where Time Begins':
# http://www.tongatapu.net.to/tonga/homeland/timebegins.htm
#
# Until 1941 Tonga maintained a standard time 50 minutes ahead of NZST
# 12 hours and 20 minutes ahead of GMT.  When New Zealand adjusted its
# standard time in 1940s, Tonga had the choice of subtracting from its
# local time to come on the same standard time as New Zealand or of
# advancing its time to maintain the differential of 13 degrees
# (approximately 50 minutes ahead of New Zealand time).
#
# Because His Majesty King Tāufaʻāhau Tupou IV, then Crown Prince
# Tungī, preferred to ensure Tonga's title as the land where time
# begins, the Legislative Assembly approved the latter change.
#
# But some of the older, more conservative members from the outer
# islands objected. "If at midnight on Dec. 31, we move ahead 40
# minutes, as your Royal Highness wishes, what becomes of the 40
# minutes we have lost?"
#
# The Crown Prince, presented an unanswerable argument: "Remember that
# on the World Day of Prayer, you would be the first people on Earth
# to say your prayers in the morning."

# From Paul Eggert (2006-03-22):
# Shanks & Pottenger say the transition was on 1968-10-01; go with Mundell.

# From Eric Ulevik (1999-05-03):
# Tonga's director of tourism, who is also secretary of the National Millennium
# Committee, has a plan to get Tonga back in front.
# He has proposed a one-off move to tropical daylight saving for Tonga from
# October to March, which has won approval in principle from the Tongan
# Government.

# From Steffen Thorsen (1999-09-09):
# * Tonga will introduce DST in November
#
# I was given this link by John Letts:
# http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/world/asia-pacific/newsid_424000/424764.stm
#
# I have not been able to find exact dates for the transition in November
# yet. By reading this article it seems like Fiji will be 14 hours ahead
# of UTC as well, but as far as I know Fiji will only be 13 hours ahead
# (12 + 1 hour DST).

# From Arthur David Olson (1999-09-20):
# According to <http://www.tongaonline.com/news/sept1799.html>:
# "Daylight Savings Time will take effect on Oct. 2 through April 15, 2000
# and annually thereafter from the first Saturday in October through the
# third Saturday of April.  Under the system approved by Privy Council on
# Sept. 10, clocks must be turned ahead one hour on the opening day and
# set back an hour on the closing date."
# Alas, no indication of the time of day.

# From Rives McDow (1999-10-06):
# Tonga started its Daylight Saving on Saturday morning October 2nd at 0200am.
# Daylight Saving ends on April 16 at 0300am which is Sunday morning.

# From Steffen Thorsen (2000-10-31):
# Back in March I found a notice on the website http://www.tongaonline.com
# that Tonga changed back to standard time one month early, on March 19
# instead of the original reported date April 16. Unfortunately, the article
# is no longer available on the site, and I did not make a copy of the
# text, and I have forgotten to report it here.
# (Original URL was <http://www.tongaonline.com/news/march162000.htm>)

# From Rives McDow (2000-12-01):
# Tonga is observing DST as of 2000-11-04 and will stop on 2001-01-27.

# From Sione Moala-Mafi (2001-09-20) via Rives McDow:
# At 2:00am on the first Sunday of November, the standard time in the Kingdom
# shall be moved forward by one hour to 3:00am.  At 2:00am on the last Sunday
# of January the standard time in the Kingdom shall be moved backward by one
# hour to 1:00am.

# From Pulu ʻAnau (2002-11-05):
# The law was for 3 years, supposedly to get renewed.  It wasn't.

# From Pulu ʻAnau (2016-10-27):
# http://mic.gov.to/news-today/press-releases/6375-daylight-saving-set-to-run-from-6-november-2016-to-15-january-2017
# Cannot find anyone who knows the rules, has seen the duration or has seen
# the cabinet decision, but it appears we are following Fiji's rule set.
#
# From Tim Parenti (2016-10-26):
# Assume Tonga will observe DST from the first Sunday in November at 02:00
# through the third Sunday in January at 03:00, like Fiji, for now.

# Wake

# From Vernice Anderson, Personal Secretary to Philip Jessup,
# US Ambassador At Large (oral history interview, 1971-02-02):
#
# Saturday, the 14th [of October, 1950] - ...  The time was all the
# more confusing at that point, because we had crossed the
# International Date Line, thus getting two Sundays.  Furthermore, we
# discovered that Wake Island had two hours of daylight saving time
# making calculation of time in Washington difficult if not almost
# impossible.
#
# http://www.trumanlibrary.org/wake/meeting.htm

# From Paul Eggert (2003-03-23):
# We have no other report of DST in Wake Island, so omit this info for now.

###############################################################################

# The International Date Line

# From Gwillim Law (2000-01-03):
#
# The International Date Line is not defined by any international standard,
# convention, or treaty.  Mapmakers are free to draw it as they please.
# Reputable mapmakers will simply ensure that every point of land appears on
# the correct side of the IDL, according to the date legally observed there.
#
# When Kiribati adopted a uniform date in 1995, thereby moving the Phoenix and
# Line Islands to the west side of the IDL (or, if you prefer, moving the IDL
# to the east side of the Phoenix and Line Islands), I suppose that most
# mapmakers redrew the IDL following the boundary of Kiribati.  Even that line
# has a rather arbitrary nature.  The straight-line boundaries between Pacific
# island nations that are shown on many maps are based on an international
# convention, but are not legally binding national borders.... The date is
# governed by the IDL; therefore, even on the high seas, there may be some
# places as late as fourteen hours later than UTC.  And, since the IDL is not
# an international standard, there are some places on the high seas where the
# correct date is ambiguous.

# From Wikipedia <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_zone> (2005-08-31):
# Before 1920, all ships kept local apparent time on the high seas by setting
# their clocks at night or at the morning sight so that, given the ship's
# speed and direction, it would be 12 o'clock when the Sun crossed the ship's
# meridian (12 o'clock = local apparent noon).  During 1917, at the
# Anglo-French Conference on Time-keeping at Sea, it was recommended that all
# ships, both military and civilian, should adopt hourly standard time zones
# on the high seas.  Whenever a ship was within the territorial waters of any
# nation it would use that nation's standard time.  The captain was permitted
# to change his ship's clocks at a time of his choice following his ship's
# entry into another zone time - he often chose midnight.  These zones were
# adopted by all major fleets between 1920 and 1925 but not by many
# independent merchant ships until World War II.

# From Paul Eggert, using references suggested by Oscar van Vlijmen
# (2005-03-20):
#
# The American Practical Navigator (2002)
# http://pollux.nss.nima.mil/pubs/pubs_j_apn_sections.html?rid=187
# talks only about the 180-degree meridian with respect to ships in
# international waters; it ignores the international date line.

# confirmed has been passed...Most of the sections are about maps rather
# than the time zone change, but I'll paste the relevant bits below. But
# the essence is that at midnight 29 Dec (UTC-11 I suppose), Samoa
# changes from UTC-11 to UTC+13:
#
# International Date Line Bill 2011
#
# AN ACT to provide for the change to standard time in Samoa and to make
# consequential amendments to the position of the International Date
# Line, and for related purposes.
#
# BE IT ENACTED by the Legislative Assembly of Samoa in Parliament
# assembled as follows:
#
# 1. Short title and commencement-(1) This Act may be cited as the
# International Date Line Act 2011. (2) Except for section 5(3) this Act
# commences at 12 o'clock midnight, on Thursday 29th December 2011. (3)
# Section 5(3) commences on the date of assent by the Head of State.
#
# [snip]
#
# 3. Interpretation - [snip] "Samoa standard time" in this Act and any
# other statute of Samoa which refers to 'Samoa standard time' means the
# time 13 hours in advance of Co-ordinated Universal Time.
#
# 4. Samoa standard time - (1) Upon the commencement of this Act, Samoa
# standard time shall be set at 13 hours in advance of Co-ordinated
# Universal Time for the whole of Samoa. (2) All references to Samoa's
# time zone and to Samoa standard time in Samoa in all legislation and
# instruments after the commencement of this Act shall be references to
# Samoa standard time as provided for in this Act. (3) Nothing in this
# Act affects the provisions of the Daylight Saving Act 2009, except that

# From Chuck Soper (2006-06-01):
# I recently found this Australian government web page on time zones:
# <http://www.australia.gov.au/about-australia-13time>
# And this government web page lists time zone names and abbreviations:
# <http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/averages/tables/daysavtm.shtml>

# From Paul Eggert (2001-04-05), summarizing a long discussion about "EST"
# versus "AEST" etc.:
#
# I see the following points of dispute:
#
# * How important are unique time zone abbreviations?
#
#   Here I tend to agree with the point (most recently made by Chris
#   Newman) that unique abbreviations should not be essential for proper
#   operation of software.  We have other instances of ambiguity
#   (e.g. "IST" denoting both "Israel Standard Time" and "Indian
#   Standard Time"), and they are not likely to go away any time soon.
#   In the old days, some software mistakenly relied on unique
#   abbreviations, but this is becoming less true with time, and I don't
#   think it's that important to cater to such software these days.
#
#   On the other hand, there is another motivation for unambiguous
#   abbreviations: it cuts down on human confusion.  This is
#   particularly true for Australia, where "EST" can mean one thing for
#   time T and a different thing for time T plus 1 second.
#
# * Does the relevant legislation indicate which abbreviations should be used?
#
#   Here I tend to think that things are a mess, just as they are in
#   many other countries.  We Americans are currently disagreeing about
#   which abbreviation to use for the newly legislated Chamorro Standard
#   Time, for example.
#
#   Personally, I would prefer to use common practice; I would like to
#   refer to legislation only for examples of common practice, or as a
#   tiebreaker.
#
# * Do Australians more often use "Eastern Daylight Time" or "Eastern
#   Summer Time"?  Do they typically prefix the time zone names with
#   the word "Australian"?
#
#   My own impression is that both "Daylight Time" and "Summer Time" are
#   common and are widely understood, but that "Summer Time" is more
#   popular; and that the leading "A" is also common but is omitted more
#   often than not.  I just used AltaVista advanced search and got the
#   following count of page hits:
#
#     1,103 "Eastern Summer Time" AND domain:au
#       971 "Australian Eastern Summer Time" AND domain:au
#       613 "Eastern Daylight Time" AND domain:au
#       127 "Australian Eastern Daylight Time" AND domain:au
#
#   Here "Summer" seems quite a bit more popular than "Daylight",
#   particularly when we know the time zone is Australian and not US,
#   say.  The "Australian" prefix seems to be popular for Eastern Summer
#   Time, but unpopular for Eastern Daylight Time.
#
#   For abbreviations, tools like AltaVista are less useful because of
#   ambiguity.  Many hits are not really time zones, unfortunately, and
#   many hits denote US time zones and not Australian ones.  But here
#   are the hit counts anyway:
#
#     161,304 "EST" and domain:au
#      25,156 "EDT" and domain:au
#      18,263 "AEST" and domain:au
#      10,416 "AEDT" and domain:au
#
#      14,538 "CST" and domain:au
#       5,728 "CDT" and domain:au
#         176 "ACST" and domain:au
#          29 "ACDT" and domain:au
#
#       7,539 "WST" and domain:au
#          68 "AWST" and domain:au
#
#   This data suggest that Australians tend to omit the "A" prefix in
#   practice.  The situation for "ST" versus "DT" is less clear, given
#   the ambiguities involved.
#
# * How do Australians feel about the abbreviations in the tz database?
#
#   If you just count Australians on this list, I count 2 in favor and 3
#   against.  One of the "against" votes (David Keegel) counseled delay,
#   saying that both AEST/AEDT and EST/EST are widely used and
#   understood in Australia.

# Samoa's parliament passed the Daylight Saving Bill 2009, and will start

# last Sunday of March 2010. We hope that the full text will be published

#
# Considering the recent devastation on Samoa by earthquake and tsunami and that
# many government offices/ ministers are closed- not sure if "Daylight Saving

# Consul General

#
# Talofa Alexander,
#
# Thank you for your sympathy for our country but at this time we have not
# been informed about the Daylight Savings Time Change.  Most Ministries in
# Apia are closed or relocating due to weather concerns.
#
# When we do find out if they are still proceeding with the time change we
# will advise you soonest.
#
# Kind Regards,
# Lana
# for: Consul General

# From Steffen Thorsen (2009-10-05):
# We have called a hotel in Samoa and asked about local time there - they 
# are still on standard time.

# located in a strip overlapping the border of South Australia and Western 
# Australia.  South Australia observes daylight saving time; Western 
# Australia does not.  The two states are one and a half hours apart.  The 
# residents decided to forget about this nonsense of changing the clock so 
# much and set the local time 20 hours and 45 minutes from the 
# international date line, or right in the middle of the time of South 
# Australia and Western Australia.  As it only affects about 10 people and 
# tourists staying at the Madura Motel, it has never really made as big an 
# impact as Broken Hill.  However, as tourist visiting there or anyone
