Starting with 2.15.6, gawk will preserve the value of NF and $0 for
the last record read into the END rule(s).  This is important to you
if your program uses

	print

in an END rule to mean

	print ""

(i.e., print nothing).  Examine your awk programs carefully to make sure
that they use `print ""' instead of `print', otherwise you will get
strange results.

If you send me email about this, without having read this
file, I will yell at you.
