@This is a list of known problems in gawk 2.15.
Hopefully they will all be fixed in the next major release of gawk.

Please keep in mind that the code is still undergoing significant evolution.

1. The interactions with the lexer and yyerror need reworking. It is possible
   to get line numbers that are one line off if --compat or --posix is
   true and either `next file' or `delete array' are used.

   Really the whole lexical analysis stuff needs reworking.
