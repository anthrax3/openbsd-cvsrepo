=head1 NAME

README.macos - Perl under Mac OS (Classic)


=head1 SYNOPSIS

This document briefly describes perl under Mac OS (Classic).
If you are running perl under Mac OS X, you don't want to be
here (unless you are in the Classic environment under Mac OS X).

When we say "Mac OS" below, we mean pre-Mac OS X, which includes
Mac OS 7, 8, and 9.


=head1 DESCRIPTION

The perl 5.6.1 source itself builds on Mac OS, with some additional
pieces. Support for Mac OS is now in the perl core, and MacPerl will be
able to, in the future, keep in closer sync with regular perl releases.

At this time, though, it is very buggy, and is under development.  An
alpha release is coming very soon.

To build perl for Mac OS (as an MPW tool), you will need the addition
of the "macos" subdirectory, distributed separately.  It includes extra
source files, config files, and make files.  It also includes a lot of
extra Mac-specific modules.

To build the MacPerl application, you will also need the "macperl"
directory, which includes the source files for creating the
application itself.

All of this is also available from the SourceForge site, via
HTTP, FTP, and anonymous CVS.

	http://macperl.sourceforge.net/

You will also need compilers and libraries, all of them freely
available.  These are linked to from the SourceForge site. Go that site
for all things having to do with MacPerl development.

MacPerl 5.2.0r4 is available on the CPAN and on SourceForge.  It
is based on perl 5.004.


=head1 AUTHOR

perl was ported to Mac OS by Matthias Neeracher
E<lt>neeracher@@mac.comE<gt>.  It is currently maintained by Chris
Nandor E<lt>pudge@@pobox.comE<gt>.

MacPerl 5.6.1 and later are supported on Mac OS 8.1 and later, for 68040
and PowerPC architectures.  The MPW tool may be used on Mac OS 7.5.5

MacPerl 5.2.0r4 is also available, on the CPAN and on SourceForge.  It
is based on perl 5.004, and works with Mac OS 7.5.5 and 68030 computers.

The port of Perl to to Mac OS was officially removed as of Perl 5.12,
though the last offical production release of MacPerl corresponded to 
Perl 5.6. While Perl 5.10 included the port to Mac OS, ExtUtils::MakeMaker,
a core part of Perl's module installation infrastructure officially dropped support for Mac OS in April 2004.
