@# hints/dec_osf.sh

#	* If you want to debug perl or want to send a
#	stack trace for inclusion into an bug report, call
#	Configure with the additional argument  -Doptimize=-g2
#	or uncomment this assignment to "optimize":
#
#optimize=-g2
#
#	If you want both to optimise and debug with the DEC cc
#	you must have -g3, e.g. "-O4 -g3", and (re)run Configure.
#
#	* gcc can always have both -g and optimisation on.
#
#	* debugging optimised code, no matter what compiler
#	one is using, can be surprising and confusing because of
#	the optimisation tricks like code motion, code removal,
#	loop unrolling, and inlining. The source code and the
#	executable code simply do not agree any more while in
#	mid-execution, the optimiser only cares about the results.
#
#	* Configure will automatically add the often quoted
#	-DDEBUGGING for you if the -g is specified.
#
#	* There is even more optimisation available in the new
#	(GEM) DEC cc: -O5 and -fast. "man cc" will tell more about them.
#	The jury is still out whether either or neither help for Perl
#	and how much. Based on very quick testing, -fast boosts
#	raw data copy by about 5-15% (-fast brings in, among other
#	things, inlined, ahem, fast memcpy()), while on the other
#	hand searching things (index, m//, s///), seems to get slower.
#	Your mileage will vary.
#
#	* The -std is needed because the following compiled
#	without the -std and linked with -lm
#
#	#include <math.h>
#	#include <stdio.h>
#	int main(){short x=10,y=sqrt(x);printf("%d\n",y);}
#
#	will in Digital UNIX 3.* and 4.0b print 0 -- and in Digital
#	UNIX 4.0{,a} dump core: Floating point exception in the printf(),
#	the y has become a signaling NaN.
#
#	* Compilation warnings like:
#
#	"Undefined the ANSI standard macro ..."
#
#	can be ignored, at least while compiling the POSIX extension
#	and especially if using the sfio (the latter is not a standard
#	part of Perl, never mind if it says little to you).
#

# the style changed between Digital UNIX (aka DEC OSF/1) 3 and

# and it is called GEM. Many of the options we are going to use depend

Your process datasize is limited to $maxdsiz MB, which is (sadly) not
always enough to fully optimize some source code files of Perl,
at least 256 MB seems to be necessary as of Perl 5.8.0.  I'll try to
use a lower optimization level for those parts.  You could either try
using your shell's ulimit/limit/limits command to raise your datasize
(assuming the system-wide hard resource limits allow you to go higher),
or if you can't go higher and if you are a sysadmin, and you *do* want
the full optimization, you can tune the 'max_per_proc_data_size'
kernel parameter: see man sysconfigtab, and man sys_attrs_proc.

Warning!  Your libc has not yet been patched so that its "%Lf" format for
printing long doubles shows all the significant digits.  You will get errors
in the t/op/numconvert test because of this.  (The data is still good
internally, and the "%e" format of printf() or sprintf() in perl will still
produce valid results.)  See README.tru64 for additional details.

# History:
#
# perl5.005_51:
#
#	September-1998 Jarkko Hietaniemi <jhi@@iki.fi>
#
#	* Added the -DNO_EFF_ONLY_OK flag ('use filetest;' support).
#
# perl5.004_57:
#
#	19-Dec-1997 Spider Boardman <spider@@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>
#
#	* Newer Digital UNIX compilers enforce signaling for NaN without
#	  -ieee.  Added -fprm d at the same time since it's friendlier for
#	  embedding.
#
#	* Fixed the library search path to match cc, ld, and /sbin/loader.
#
#	* Default to building -Duseshrplib on newer systems.  -Uuseshrplib
#	  still overrides.
#
#	* Fix -pthread additions for useshrplib.  ld has no -pthread option.
#
#
# perl5.004_04:
#
#       19-Sep-1997 Spider Boardman <spider@@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>
#
#	* libnet on Digital UNIX is for JAVA, not for sockets.
#
#
# perl5.003_28:
#
#       22-Feb-1997 Jarkko Hietaniemi <jhi@@iki.fi>
#
#	* Restructuring Spider's suggestions.
#
#	* Older Digital UNIXes cannot handle -Olimit ... for $lddlflags.
#
#	* ld -s cannot be used in older Digital UNIXes when doing shared.
#
#
#       21-Feb-1997 Spider Boardman <spider@@Orb.Nashua.NH.US>
#
#	* -hidden removed.
#
#	* -DSTANDARD_C removed.
#
#	* -D_INTRINSICS added. (that -fast does not seem to buy much confirmed)
#
#	* odbm not in libc, only ndbm. Therefore dbm back to $libswanted.
#
#	* -msym for the newer runtime loaders.
#
#	* $optimize also in $lddflags.
#
#
# perl5.003_27:
#
#	18-Feb-1997 Jarkko Hietaniemi <jhi@@iki.fi>
#
#	* unset _DEC_cc_style and more commentary on -std.
#
#
# perl5.003_26:
#
#	15-Feb-1997 Jarkko Hietaniemi <jhi@@iki.fi>
#
#	* -std and -ansi.
#
#
# perl5.003_24:
#
#	30-Jan-1997 Jarkko Hietaniemi <jhi@@iki.fi>
#
#	* Fixing the note on -DDEBUGGING.
#
#	* Note on -O5 -fast.
#
#
# perl5.003_23:
#
#	26-Jan-1997 Jarkko Hietaniemi <jhi@@iki.fi>
#
#	* Notes on how to do both optimisation and debugging.
#
#
#	25-Jan-1997 Jarkko Hietaniemi <jhi@@iki.fi>
#
#	* Remove unneeded libraries from $libswanted: PW, bsd, c, dbm
#
#	* Restructure the $lddlflags build.
#
#	* $optimize based on which compiler we have.
#
#
# perl5.003_22:
#
#	23-Jan-1997 Achim Bohnet <ach@@rosat.mpe-garching.mpg.de>
#
#	* Added comments 'how to create a debugging version of perl'
#
#	* Fixed logic of this script to prevent stripping of shared
#         objects by the loader (see ld man page for -s) is debugging
#         is set via the -g switch.
#
#
#	21-Jan-1997 Achim Bohnet <ach@@rosat.mpe-garching.mpg.de>
#
#	* now 'dl' is always removed from libswanted. Not only if
#	  optimize is an empty string.
#
#
#	17-Jan-1997 Achim Bohnet <ach@@rosat.mpe-garching.mpg.de>
#
#	* Removed 'dl' from libswanted: When the FreePort binary
#	  translator for Sun binaries is installed Configure concludes
#	  that it should use libdl.x.yz.fpx.so :-(
#	  Because the dlopen, dlclose,... calls are in the
#	  C library it not necessary at all to check for the
#	  dl library.  Therefore dl is removed from libswanted.
#
#
#	1-Jan-1997 Achim Bohnet <ach@@rosat.mpe-garching.mpg.de>
#
#	* Set -Olimit to 3200 because perl_yylex.c got too big
#	  for the optimizer.

Your cc seems to be gcc and its version seems to be less than 2.95.
This is not a good idea since old versions of gcc are known to produce
buggy code when compiling Perl (and no doubt for other programs, too).

Therefore, I strongly suggest upgrading your gcc.  (Why don't you
use the vendor cc is also a good question.  It comes with the operating
system and produces good code.)

Note that as of gcc 2.95 (19990728) and Perl 5.6.0 (end of March 2000)
if the said Perl is compiled with the said gcc the lib/sdbm test will 
dump core.  As this doesn't happen with the vendor cc, this is
most probably a lingering bug in gcc.  Therefore unless you have
a better gcc you are still better off using the vendor cc.

#	-DDEBUGGING for you if the -g is specified.
#
#	* There is even more optimisation available in the new
#	(GEM) DEC cc: -O5 and -fast. "man cc" will tell more about them.
#	The jury is still out whether either or neither help for Perl
#	and how much. Based on very quick testing, -fast boosts
#	raw data copy by about 5-15% (-fast brings in, among other
#	things, inlined, ahem, fast memcpy()), while on the other
#	hand searching things (index, m//, s///), seems to get slower.
#	Your mileage will vary.
#
#	* The -std is needed because the following compiled
#	without the -std and linked with -lm
#
#	#include <math.h>
#	#include <stdio.h>
#	int main(){short x=10,y=sqrt(x);printf("%d\n",y);}
#
#	will in Digital UNIX 3.* and 4.0b print 0 -- and in Digital
#	UNIX 4.0{,a} dump core: Floating point exception in the printf(),
#	the y has become a signaling NaN.
#
#	* Compilation warnings like:
#
#	"Undefined the ANSI standard macro ..."
#
#	can be ignored, at least while compiling the POSIX extension
#	and especially if using the sfio (the latter is not a standard
#	part of Perl, never mind if it says little to you).

Your cc seems to be gcc and its version seems to be less than 2.95.
This is not a good idea since old versions of gcc are known to produce
buggy code when compiling Perl (and no doubt for other programs, too).

Therefore, I strongly suggest upgrading your gcc.  (Why don't you
use the vendor cc is also a good question.  It comes with the operating
system and produces good code.)

Note that as of gcc 2.95 (19990728) and Perl 5.6.0 (end of March 2000)
if the said Perl is compiled with the said gcc the lib/sdbm test will 
dump core.  As this doesn't happen with the vendor cc, this is
most probably a lingering bug in gcc.  Therefore unless you have
a better gcc you are still better off using the vendor cc.

Your process datasize is limited to $maxdsiz MB, which is (sadly) not
always enough to fully optimize some source code files of Perl,
at least 256 MB seems to be necessary as of Perl 5.8.0.  I'll try to
use a lower optimization level for those parts.  You could either try
using your shell's ulimit/limit/limits command to raise your datasize
(assuming the system-wide hard resource limits allow you to go higher),
or if you can't go higher and if you are a sysadmin, and you *do* want
the full optimization, you can tune the 'max_per_proc_data_size'
kernel parameter: see man sysconfigtab, and man sys_attrs_proc.
