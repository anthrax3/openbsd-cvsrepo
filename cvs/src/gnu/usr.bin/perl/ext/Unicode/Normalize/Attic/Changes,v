    - XSUB: even if string contains a malformed, "short" Unicode character,
      decompose() and reorder() will be safe. Garbage will be no longer added.
    - added null.t and short.t.
    - now truely added illegal.t (in 0.27, forgot to change MANIFEST).

0.27  Sun Nov 16 13:16:21 2003
    - Illegal code points (surrogate and noncharacter) will be allowed
      (keep your code with <no warnings 'utf8';>);
      but porting is not successful in the case of ((Pure Perl) and
      (Perl 5.7.3 or before)).
    - added illegal.t.

    - CAVEATS in POD is added.
    - Some test cases from Unicode Public Review Issue #29
      (Normalization Issue) are added to norm.t and test.t.
    - do 'mkheader' returns true so that Makefile.PL will catch error.
    - META.yml is added.

1.02  Tue Jun  5 22:46:45 2007
    - XSUB: mkheader, _U_stringify() - avoid unpack('C*') on unicode.
    - test: short.t removed - pure perl is not inapprotiate for test of
            unicode edge cases.

1.01  Tue Jun 13 22:01:53 2006
    - XSUB: sv_setpvn() needs cast to (char*).
    - XSUB: avoid double FETCH for tied scalar variables.
    - added tie.t.

1.00  Thu May 25 20:35:06 2006
    - Pure Perl: compose($not_canonically_reordered) works like that in XSUB,
      where an intervening character with higher combining class blocks
      the composition. (This change doesn't affect any normalization forms.)
    - XSUB: NFD(), NFC(), NFKD(), NFC(), and FCC() are now in XSUB, then
      internal subroutine calls are avoided.
    - The functions isComp_Ex(), isNFD_NO(), isNFC_NO(), isNFC_MAYBE(),
      isNFKD_NO(), isNFKC_NO(), and isNFKC_MAYBE() are documented.
    - Tests are more amplified and documentations are more clarified.
    - Makefile.PL: Change 26295 is incorporated.
