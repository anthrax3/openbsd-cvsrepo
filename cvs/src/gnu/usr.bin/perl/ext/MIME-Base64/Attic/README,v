@This package contains a base64 encoder/decoder and a quoted-printable
encoder/decoder.  These encoding methods are specified in RFC 2045 -
MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions).

The base64 encoding is designed to represent arbitrary sequences of
octets in a form that need not be humanly readable. A 65-character
subset ([A-Za-z0-9+/=]) of US-ASCII is used, enabling 6 bits to be
represented per printable character.

The quoted-printable encoding is intended to represent data that
largely consists of bytes that correspond to printable characters in
the ASCII character set.  Each non-printable character is represented by
a triplet consisting of the character "=" followed by two hexadecimal
digits.

In order to install and use this package you will need Perl version
5.6 or better.  Installation as usual:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install
