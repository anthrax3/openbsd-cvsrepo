@This is the perl5 IO distribution.

This distribution is included in the perl5 core distribution. You should
only need to install this distribution if it is newer than your perl
installation.

To install this distribution you will need access rights to the perl
install ation on your system, as it overwrites your currently installed
version of IO.

This distribution relies upon the Socket module (version 1.3), which is
avaliable from CPAN. Although you should not need to get this if your
version of perl is fairly recent, as Socket is also distributed in the
core perl distribution.

If you do not have the required modules, you will see a warning when 
the Makefile is built.

To build, test and install this distribution type:

 perl Makefile.PL
 make test
 make install

Share and Enjoy!
