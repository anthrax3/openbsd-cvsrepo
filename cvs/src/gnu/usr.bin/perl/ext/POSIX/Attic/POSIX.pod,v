@=head1 NAME

POSIX - Perl interface to IEEE Std 1003.1

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use POSIX;
    use POSIX qw(setsid);
    use POSIX qw(:errno_h :fcntl_h);

    printf "EINTR is %d\n", EINTR;

    $sess_id = POSIX::setsid();

    $fd = POSIX::open($path, O_CREAT|O_EXCL|O_WRONLY, 0644);
	# note: that's a filedescriptor, *NOT* a filehandle

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The POSIX module permits you to access all (or nearly all) the standard
POSIX 1003.1 identifiers.  Many of these identifiers have been given Perl-ish
interfaces.

I<Everything is exported by default> with the exception of any POSIX
functions with the same name as a built-in Perl function, such as
C<abs>, C<alarm>, C<rmdir>, C<write>, etc.., which will be exported
only if you ask for them explicitly.  This is an unfortunate backwards
compatibility feature.  You can stop the exporting by saying C<use
POSIX ()> and then use the fully qualified names (ie. C<POSIX::SEEK_END>).

This document gives a condensed list of the features available in the POSIX
module.  Consult your operating system's manpages for general information on
most features.  Consult L<perlfunc> for functions which are noted as being
identical to Perl's builtin functions.

The first section describes POSIX functions from the 1003.1 specification.
The second section describes some classes for signal objects, TTY objects,
and other miscellaneous objects.  The remaining sections list various
constants and macros in an organization which roughly follows IEEE Std
1003.1b-1993.

=head1 NOTE

The POSIX module is probably the most complex Perl module supplied with
the standard distribution.  It incorporates autoloading, namespace games,
and dynamic loading of code that's in Perl, C, or both.  It's a great
source of wisdom.

=head1 CAVEATS

A few functions are not implemented because they are C specific.  If you
attempt to call these, they will print a message telling you that they
aren't implemented, and suggest using the Perl equivalent should one
exist.  For example, trying to access the setjmp() call will elicit the
message "setjmp() is C-specific: use eval {} instead".

Furthermore, some evil vendors will claim 1003.1 compliance, but in fact
are not so: they will not pass the PCTS (POSIX Compliance Test Suites).
For example, one vendor may not define EDEADLK, or the semantics of the
errno values set by open(2) might not be quite right.  Perl does not
attempt to verify POSIX compliance.  That means you can currently
successfully say "use POSIX",  and then later in your program you find
that your vendor has been lax and there's no usable ICANON macro after
all.  This could be construed to be a bug.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=over 8

=item _exit

This is identical to the C function C<_exit()>.  It exits the program
immediately which means among other things buffered I/O is B<not> flushed.

Note that when using threads and in Linux this is B<not> a good way to
exit a thread because in Linux processes and threads are kind of the
same thing (Note: while this is the situation in early 2003 there are
projects under way to have threads with more POSIXly semantics in Linux).
If you want not to return from a thread, detach the thread.

=item abort

This is identical to the C function C<abort()>.  It terminates the
process with a C<SIGABRT> signal unless caught by a signal handler or
if the handler does not return normally (it e.g.  does a C<longjmp>).

=item abs

This is identical to Perl's builtin C<abs()> function, returning
the absolute value of its numerical argument.

=item access

Determines the accessibility of a file.

	if( POSIX::access( "/", &POSIX::R_OK ) ){
		print "have read permission\n";
	}

Returns C<undef> on failure.  Note: do not use C<access()> for
security purposes.  Between the C<access()> call and the operation
you are preparing for the permissions might change: a classic
I<race condition>.

=item acos

This is identical to the C function C<acos()>, returning
the arcus cosine of its numerical argument.  See also L<Math::Trig>.

=item alarm

This is identical to Perl's builtin C<alarm()> function,
either for arming or disarming the C<SIGARLM> timer.

=item asctime

This is identical to the C function C<asctime()>.  It returns
a string of the form

	"Fri Jun  2 18:22:13 2000\n\0"

and it is called thusly

	$asctime = asctime($sec, $min, $hour, $mday, $mon, $year,
			   $wday, $yday, $isdst);

The C<$mon> is zero-based: January equals C<0>.  The C<$year> is
1900-based: 2001 equals C<101>.  C<$wday> and C<$yday> default to zero
(and are usually ignored anyway), and C<$isdst> defaults to -1.

=item asin

This is identical to the C function C<asin()>, returning
the arcus sine of its numerical argument.  See also L<Math::Trig>.

=item assert

Unimplemented, but you can use L<perlfunc/die> and the L<Carp> module
to achieve similar things.

=item atan

This is identical to the C function C<atan()>, returning the
arcus tangent of its numerical argument.  See also L<Math::Trig>.

=item atan2

This is identical to Perl's builtin C<atan2()> function, returning
the arcus tangent defined by its two numerical arguments, the I<y>
coordinate and the I<x> coordinate.  See also L<Math::Trig>.

=item atexit

atexit() is C-specific: use C<END {}> instead, see L<perlsub>.

=item atof

atof() is C-specific.  Perl converts strings to numbers transparently.

If you need to force a scalar to a number, add a zero to it.
If you need to have just the integer part, see L<perlfunc/int>.

to a tty.  Similar to the C<-t> operator, see L<perlfunc/-X>.

=item iscntrl

This is identical to the C function, except that it can apply to
a single character or to a whole string.  Note that locale settings
may affect what characters are considered C<iscntrl>.  Does not work
on Unicode characters code point 256 or higher.  Consider using regular
expressions and the C</[[:cntrl:]]/> construct instead.

=item isdigit

This is identical to the C function, except that it can apply to
a single character or to a whole string.  Note that locale settings
may affect what characters are considered C<isdigit> (unlikely, but
still possible). Does not work on Unicode characters code point 256
or higher.  Consider using regular expressions and the C</[[:digit:]]/>
construct instead, or the C</\d/> construct.

=item isgraph

This is identical to the C function, except that it can apply to
a single character or to a whole string.  Note that locale settings

on Unicode characters code point 256 or higher.  Consider using regular
expressions and the C</[[:space:]]/> construct instead, or the C</\s/>
construct.  (Note that C</\s/> and C</[[:space:]]/> are slightly
different in that C</[[:space:]]/> can normally match a vertical tab,
while C</\s/> does not.)

=item isupper

This is identical to the C function, except that it can apply to
a single character or to a whole string.  Note that locale settings
may affect what characters are considered C<isupper>.  Does not work

expressions and the C</[[:upper:]]/> construct instead.  Do B<not> use
C</[A-Z]/>.

character or to a whole string.  Note that locale settings may affect what
characters are considered C<isxdigit> (unlikely, but still possible).
Does not work on Unicode characters code point 256 or higher.
Consider using regular expressions and the C</[[:xdigit:]]/>

returning the natural (I<e>-based) logarithm of the numerical argument,
see L<perlfunc/log>.

=item log10

or

    sub log10 { log($_[0]) * 0.434294481903252 }

=item longjmp

longjmp() is C-specific: use L<perlfunc/die> instead.

	$off_t = POSIX::lseek( $fd, 0, &POSIX::SEEK_SET );

Returns C<undef> on failure.

=item malloc

malloc() is C-specific.  Perl does memory management transparently.

=item mblen

This is identical to the C function C<mblen()>.
Perl does not have any support for the wide and multibyte
characters of the C standards, so this might be a rather
useless function.

=item mbstowcs

This is identical to the C function C<mbstowcs()>.
Perl does not have any support for the wide and multibyte
characters of the C standards, so this might be a rather
useless function.

=item mbtowc

	($fractional, $integral) = POSIX::modf( 3.14 );

=item nice

This is similar to the C function C<nice()>, for changing
the scheduling preference of the current process.  Positive
arguments mean more polite process, negative values more
needy process.  Normal user processes can only be more polite.

Returns C<undef> on failure.

=item offsetof

offsetof() is C-specific, you probably want to see L<perlfunc/pack> instead.

=item open

Open a file for reading for writing.  This returns file descriptors, not
Perl filehandles.  Use C<POSIX::close> to close the file.

Open a file read-only with mode 0666.

The following will determine the maximum length of the longest allowable
pathname on the filesystem which holds C</var>.

	$path_max = POSIX::pathconf( "/var", &POSIX::_PC_PATH_MAX );

Returns C<undef> on failure.

=item pause

This is similar to the C function C<pause()>, which suspends
the execution of the current process until a signal is received.

Returns C<undef> on failure.

=item perror

This is identical to the C function C<perror()>, which outputs to the
standard error stream the specified message followed by ": " and the
current error string.  Use the C<warn()> function and the C<$!>
variable instead, see L<perlfunc/warn> and L<perlvar/$ERRNO>.

=item pipe

Create an interprocess channel.  This returns file descriptors like those
returned by C<POSIX::open>.

	my ($read, $write) = POSIX::pipe();
	POSIX::write( $write, "hello", 5 );
	POSIX::read( $read, $buf, 5 );

See also L<perlfunc/pipe>.

=item pow

Computes C<$x> raised to the power C<$exponent>.

	$ret = POSIX::pow( $x, $exponent );

You can also use the C<**> operator, see L<perlop>.

=item printf

See also L<perlfunc/printf>.

=item putc

putc() is C-specific, see L<perlfunc/print> instead.

=item putchar

putchar() is C-specific, see L<perlfunc/print> instead.

See also L<perlfunc/kill> and the C<$$> in L<perlvar/$PID>.

=item rand

C<rand()> is non-portable, see L<perlfunc/rand> instead.

=item read

Read from a file.  This uses file descriptors such as those obtained by
calling C<POSIX::open>.  If the buffer C<$buf> is not large enough for the
read then Perl will extend it to make room for the request.

	$fd = POSIX::open( "foo", &POSIX::O_RDONLY );
	$bytes = POSIX::read( $fd, $buf, 3 );

Returns C<undef> on failure.

See also L<perlfunc/sysread>.

=item readdir

This is identical to Perl's builtin C<readdir()> function
for reading directory entries, see L<perlfunc/readdir>.

=item realloc

realloc() is C-specific.  Perl does memory management transparently.

=item remove

This is identical to Perl's builtin C<unlink()> function
for removing files, see L<perlfunc/unlink>.

=item rename

rewinding directory entry streams, see L<perlfunc/rewinddir>.

=item rmdir

This is identical to Perl's builtin C<rmdir()> function
for removing (empty) directories, see L<perlfunc/rmdir>.

=item scanf

scanf() is C-specific, use E<lt>E<gt> and regular expressions instead,
see L<perlre>.

=item setgid

Sets the real group identifier and the effective group identifier for
this process.  Similar to assigning a value to the Perl's builtin
C<$)> variable, see L<perlvar/$EGID>, except that the latter
will change only the real user identifier, and that the setgid()
uses only a single numeric argument, as opposed to a space-separated
list of numbers.

=item setjmp

C<setjmp()> is C-specific: use C<eval {}> instead,
see L<perlfunc/eval>.

=item setlocale

Modifies and queries program's locale.  The following examples assume

	use POSIX qw(setlocale LC_ALL LC_CTYPE);

has been issued.

The following will set the traditional UNIX system locale behavior
(the second argument C<"C">).

	$loc = setlocale( LC_ALL, "C" );

The following will query the current LC_CTYPE category.  (No second
argument means 'query'.)

	$loc = setlocale( LC_CTYPE );

The following will set the LC_CTYPE behaviour according to the locale
environment variables (the second argument C<"">).
Please see your systems C<setlocale(3)> documentation for the locale
environment variables' meaning or consult L<perllocale>.

	$loc = setlocale( LC_CTYPE, "" );

The following will set the LC_COLLATE behaviour to Argentinian
Spanish. B<NOTE>: The naming and availability of locales depends on
your operating system. Please consult L<perllocale> for how to find
out which locales are available in your system.

	$loc = setlocale( LC_COLLATE, "es_AR.ISO8859-1" );

=item setpgid

This is similar to the C function C<setpgid()> for
setting the process group identifier of the current process.

Returns C<undef> on failure.

=item setsid

This is identical to the C function C<setsid()> for
setting the session identifier of the current process.

=item setuid

Sets the real user identifier and the effective user identifier for
this process.  Similar to assigning a value to the Perl's builtin
C<$E<lt>> variable, see L<perlvar/$UID>, except that the latter
will change only the real user identifier.

=item sigaction

Detailed signal management.  This uses C<POSIX::SigAction> objects for
the C<action> and C<oldaction> arguments (the oldaction can also be
just a hash reference).  Consult your system's C<sigaction> manpage
for details, see also C<POSIX::SigRt>.

Synopsis:

	sigaction(signal, action, oldaction = 0)

Returns C<undef> on failure.  The C<signal> must be a number (like
SIGHUP), not a string (like "SIGHUP"), though Perl does try hard
to understand you.

If you use the SA_SIGINFO flag, the signal handler will in addition to
the first argument, the signal name, also receive a second argument, a
hash reference, inside which are the following keys with the following
semantics, as defined by POSIX/SUSv3:

    signo       the signal number
    errno       the error number
    code        if this is zero or less, the signal was sent by
                a user process and the uid and pid make sense,
                otherwise the signal was sent by the kernel

The following are also defined by POSIX/SUSv3, but unfortunately
not very widely implemented:

    pid         the process id generating the signal
    uid         the uid of the process id generating the signal
    status      exit value or signal for SIGCHLD
    band        band event for SIGPOLL

A third argument is also passed to the handler, which contains a copy
of the raw binary contents of the siginfo structure: if a system has
some non-POSIX fields, this third argument is where to unpack() them
from.

Note that not all siginfo values make sense simultaneously (some are
valid only for certain signals, for example), and not all values make
sense from Perl perspective, you should to consult your system's
C<sigaction> and possibly also C<siginfo> documentation.

=item siglongjmp

siglongjmp() is C-specific: use L<perlfunc/die> instead.

=item sigpending

Examine signals that are blocked and pending.  This uses C<POSIX::SigSet>
objects for the C<sigset> argument.  Consult your system's C<sigpending>
manpage for details.

Synopsis:

	sigpending(sigset)

Returns C<undef> on failure.

=item sigprocmask

Change and/or examine calling process's signal mask.  This uses
C<POSIX::SigSet> objects for the C<sigset> and C<oldsigset> arguments.
Consult your system's C<sigprocmask> manpage for details.

Synopsis:

	sigprocmask(how, sigset, oldsigset = 0)

Returns C<undef> on failure.

=item sigsetjmp

C<sigsetjmp()> is C-specific: use C<eval {}> instead,
see L<perlfunc/eval>.

=item sigsuspend

Install a signal mask and suspend process until signal arrives.  This uses
C<POSIX::SigSet> objects for the C<signal_mask> argument.  Consult your
system's C<sigsuspend> manpage for details.

Synopsis:

	sigsuspend(signal_mask)

Returns C<undef> on failure.

=item sin

This is identical to Perl's builtin C<sin()> function
for returning the sine of the numerical argument,
see L<perlfunc/sin>.  See also L<Math::Trig>.

=item sinh

This is identical to the C function C<sinh()>
for returning the hyperbolic sine of the numerical argument.
See also L<Math::Trig>.

=item sleep

This is functionally identical to Perl's builtin C<sleep()> function
for suspending the execution of the current for process for certain
number of seconds, see L<perlfunc/sleep>.  There is one significant
difference, however: C<POSIX::sleep()> returns the number of
B<unslept> seconds, while the C<CORE::sleep()> returns the
number of slept seconds.

=item sprintf

This is similar to Perl's builtin C<sprintf()> function
for returning a string that has the arguments formatted as requested,
see L<perlfunc/sprintf>.

=item sqrt

This is identical to Perl's builtin C<sqrt()> function.
for returning the square root of the numerical argument,
see L<perlfunc/sqrt>.

=item srand

=item sscanf

sscanf() is C-specific, use regular expressions instead,
see L<perlre>.

=item stat

This is identical to Perl's builtin C<stat()> function
for returning information about files and directories.

=item strcat

strcat() is C-specific, use C<.=> instead, see L<perlop>.

=item strchr

strchr() is C-specific, see L<perlfunc/index> instead.

=item strcmp

strcmp() is C-specific, use C<eq> or C<cmp> instead, see L<perlop>.

=item strcoll

This is identical to the C function C<strcoll()>
for collating (comparing) strings transformed using
the C<strxfrm()> function.  Not really needed since
Perl can do this transparently, see L<perllocale>.

=item strcpy

strcpy() is C-specific, use C<=> instead, see L<perlop>.

=item strcspn

strcspn() is C-specific, use regular expressions instead,
see L<perlre>.

=item strerror

Returns the error string for the specified errno.
Identical to the string form of the C<$!>, see L<perlvar/$ERRNO>.

=item strftime

Convert date and time information to string.  Returns the string.

Synopsis:

	strftime(fmt, sec, min, hour, mday, mon, year, wday = -1, yday = -1, isdst = -1)

The month (C<mon>), weekday (C<wday>), and yearday (C<yday>) begin at zero.
I.e. January is 0, not 1; Sunday is 0, not 1; January 1st is 0, not 1.  The
year (C<year>) is given in years since 1900.  I.e., the year 1995 is 95; the
year 2001 is 101.  Consult your system's C<strftime()> manpage for details
about these and the other arguments.

If you want your code to be portable, your format (C<fmt>) argument
should use only the conversion specifiers defined by the ANSI C
standard (C89, to play safe).  These are C<aAbBcdHIjmMpSUwWxXyYZ%>.
But even then, the B<results> of some of the conversion specifiers are
non-portable.  For example, the specifiers C<aAbBcpZ> change according
to the locale settings of the user, and both how to set locales (the
locale names) and what output to expect are non-standard.
The specifier C<c> changes according to the timezone settings of the
user and the timezone computation rules of the operating system.
The C<Z> specifier is notoriously unportable since the names of
timezones are non-standard. Sticking to the numeric specifiers is the
safest route.

The given arguments are made consistent as though by calling
C<mktime()> before calling your system's C<strftime()> function,
except that the C<isdst> value is not affected.

The string for Tuesday, December 12, 1995.

	$str = POSIX::strftime( "%A, %B %d, %Y", 0, 0, 0, 12, 11, 95, 2 );
	print "$str\n";

=item strlen

strlen() is C-specific, use C<length()> instead, see L<perlfunc/length>.

=item strncat

strncat() is C-specific, use C<.=> instead, see L<perlop>.

=item strncmp

strncmp() is C-specific, use C<eq> instead, see L<perlop>.

=item strncpy

strncpy() is C-specific, use C<=> instead, see L<perlop>.

=item strpbrk

strpbrk() is C-specific, use regular expressions instead,
see L<perlre>.

=item strrchr

strrchr() is C-specific, see L<perlfunc/rindex> instead.

=item strspn

strspn() is C-specific, use regular expressions instead,
see L<perlre>.

=item strstr

This is identical to Perl's builtin C<index()> function,
see L<perlfunc/index>.

=item strtod

String to double translation. Returns the parsed number and the number
of characters in the unparsed portion of the string.  Truly
POSIX-compliant systems set $! ($ERRNO) to indicate a translation
error, so clear $! before calling strtod.  However, non-POSIX systems
may not check for overflow, and therefore will never set $!.

strtod should respect any POSIX I<setlocale()> settings.

To parse a string $str as a floating point number use

    $! = 0;
    ($num, $n_unparsed) = POSIX::strtod($str);

The second returned item and $! can be used to check for valid input:

    if (($str eq '') || ($n_unparsed != 0) || $!) {
        die "Non-numeric input $str" . ($! ? ": $!\n" : "\n");
    }

When called in a scalar context strtod returns the parsed number.

=item strtok

strtok() is C-specific, use regular expressions instead, see
L<perlre>, or L<perlfunc/split>.

=item strtol

String to (long) integer translation.  Returns the parsed number and
the number of characters in the unparsed portion of the string.  Truly
POSIX-compliant systems set $! ($ERRNO) to indicate a translation
error, so clear $! before calling strtol.  However, non-POSIX systems
may not check for overflow, and therefore will never set $!.

strtol should respect any POSIX I<setlocale()> settings.

To parse a string $str as a number in some base $base use

    $! = 0;
    ($num, $n_unparsed) = POSIX::strtol($str, $base);

The base should be zero or between 2 and 36, inclusive.  When the base
is zero or omitted strtol will use the string itself to determine the
base: a leading "0x" or "0X" means hexadecimal; a leading "0" means
octal; any other leading characters mean decimal.  Thus, "1234" is
parsed as a decimal number, "01234" as an octal number, and "0x1234"
as a hexadecimal number.

The second returned item and $! can be used to check for valid input:

    if (($str eq '') || ($n_unparsed != 0) || !$!) {
        die "Non-numeric input $str" . $! ? ": $!\n" : "\n";
    }

When called in a scalar context strtol returns the parsed number.

=item strtoul

String to unsigned (long) integer translation.  strtoul() is identical
to strtol() except that strtoul() only parses unsigned integers.  See
L</strtol> for details.

Note: Some vendors supply strtod() and strtol() but not strtoul().
Other vendors that do supply strtoul() parse "-1" as a valid value.

=item strxfrm

String transformation.  Returns the transformed string.

	$dst = POSIX::strxfrm( $src );

Used in conjunction with the C<strcoll()> function, see L</strcoll>.

Not really needed since Perl can do this transparently, see
L<perllocale>.

=item sysconf

Retrieves values of system configurable variables.

The following will get the machine's clock speed.

	$clock_ticks = POSIX::sysconf( &POSIX::_SC_CLK_TCK );

Returns C<undef> on failure.

=item system

This is identical to Perl's builtin C<system()> function, see
L<perlfunc/system>.

=item tan

This is identical to the C function C<tan()>, returning the
tangent of the numerical argument.  See also L<Math::Trig>.

=item tanh

This is identical to the C function C<tanh()>, returning the
hyperbolic tangent of the numerical argument.   See also L<Math::Trig>.

=item tcdrain

This is similar to the C function C<tcdrain()> for draining
the output queue of its argument stream.

Returns C<undef> on failure.

=item tcflow

This is similar to the C function C<tcflow()> for controlling
the flow of its argument stream.

Returns C<undef> on failure.

=item tcflush

This is similar to the C function C<tcflush()> for flushing
the I/O buffers of its argument stream.

Returns C<undef> on failure.

=item tcgetpgrp

This is identical to the C function C<tcgetpgrp()> for returning the
process group identifier of the foreground process group of the controlling
terminal.

=item tcsendbreak

This is similar to the C function C<tcsendbreak()> for sending
a break on its argument stream.

Returns C<undef> on failure.

=item tcsetpgrp

This is similar to the C function C<tcsetpgrp()> for setting the
process group identifier of the foreground process group of the controlling
terminal.

Returns C<undef> on failure.

=item time

This is identical to Perl's builtin C<time()> function
for returning the number of seconds since the epoch
(whatever it is for the system), see L<perlfunc/time>.

=item times

The times() function returns elapsed realtime since some point in the past
(such as system startup), user and system times for this process, and user
and system times used by child processes.  All times are returned in clock
ticks.

    ($realtime, $user, $system, $cuser, $csystem) = POSIX::times();

Note: Perl's builtin C<times()> function returns four values, measured in
seconds.

=item tmpfile

Use method C<IO::File::new_tmpfile()> instead, or see L<File::Temp>.

=item tmpnam

Returns a name for a temporary file.

	$tmpfile = POSIX::tmpnam();

For security reasons, which are probably detailed in your system's
documentation for the C library tmpnam() function, this interface
should not be used; instead see L<File::Temp>.

=item tolower

This is identical to the C function, except that it can apply to a single
character or to a whole string.  Consider using the C<lc()> function,
see L<perlfunc/lc>, or the equivalent C<\L> operator inside doublequotish
strings.

=item toupper

This is identical to the C function, except that it can apply to a single
character or to a whole string.  Consider using the C<uc()> function,
see L<perlfunc/uc>, or the equivalent C<\U> operator inside doublequotish
strings.

=item ttyname

This is identical to the C function C<ttyname()> for returning the
name of the current terminal.

=item tzname

Retrieves the time conversion information from the C<tzname> variable.

	POSIX::tzset();
	($std, $dst) = POSIX::tzname();

=item tzset

This is identical to the C function C<tzset()> for setting
the current timezone based on the environment variable C<TZ>,
to be used by C<ctime()>, C<localtime()>, C<mktime()>, and C<strftime()>
functions.

=item umask

This is identical to Perl's builtin C<umask()> function
for setting (and querying) the file creation permission mask,
see L<perlfunc/umask>.

=item uname

Get name of current operating system.

	($sysname, $nodename, $release, $version, $machine) = POSIX::uname();

Note that the actual meanings of the various fields are not
that well standardized, do not expect any great portability.
The C<$sysname> might be the name of the operating system,
the C<$nodename> might be the name of the host, the C<$release>
might be the (major) release number of the operating system,
the C<$version> might be the (minor) release number of the
operating system, and the C<$machine> might be a hardware identifier.
Maybe.

=item ungetc

Use method C<IO::Handle::ungetc()> instead.

=item unlink

This is identical to Perl's builtin C<unlink()> function
for removing files, see L<perlfunc/unlink>.

=item utime

This is identical to Perl's builtin C<utime()> function
for changing the time stamps of files and directories,
see L<perlfunc/utime>.

=item vfprintf

vfprintf() is C-specific, see L<perlfunc/printf> instead.

=item vprintf

vprintf() is C-specific, see L<perlfunc/printf> instead.

=item vsprintf

vsprintf() is C-specific, see L<perlfunc/sprintf> instead.

=item wait

This is identical to Perl's builtin C<wait()> function,
see L<perlfunc/wait>.

=item waitpid

Wait for a child process to change state.  This is identical to Perl's
builtin C<waitpid()> function, see L<perlfunc/waitpid>.

	$pid = POSIX::waitpid( -1, POSIX::WNOHANG );
	print "status = ", ($? / 256), "\n";

=item wcstombs

This is identical to the C function C<wcstombs()>.
Perl does not have any support for the wide and multibyte
characters of the C standards, so this might be a rather
useless function.

=item wctomb

This is identical to the C function C<wctomb()>.
Perl does not have any support for the wide and multibyte
characters of the C standards, so this might be a rather
useless function.

=item write

Write to a file.  This uses file descriptors such as those obtained by
calling C<POSIX::open>.

	$fd = POSIX::open( "foo", &POSIX::O_WRONLY );
	$buf = "hello";
	$bytes = POSIX::write( $fd, $buf, 5 );

Returns C<undef> on failure.

See also L<perlfunc/syswrite>.

=back

=head1 CLASSES

=head2 POSIX::SigAction

=over 8

=item new

Creates a new C<POSIX::SigAction> object which corresponds to the C
C<struct sigaction>.  This object will be destroyed automatically when
it is no longer needed.  The first parameter is the handler, a sub
reference.  The second parameter is a C<POSIX::SigSet> object, it
defaults to the empty set.  The third parameter contains the
C<sa_flags>, it defaults to 0.

	$sigset = POSIX::SigSet->new(SIGINT, SIGQUIT);
	$sigaction = POSIX::SigAction->new( \&handler, $sigset, &POSIX::SA_NOCLDSTOP );

This C<POSIX::SigAction> object is intended for use with the C<POSIX::sigaction()>
function.

=back

=over 8

=item handler

=item mask

=item flags

accessor functions to get/set the values of a SigAction object.

	$sigset = $sigaction->mask;
	$sigaction->flags(&POSIX::SA_RESTART);

=item safe

accessor function for the "safe signals" flag of a SigAction object; see
L<perlipc> for general information on safe (a.k.a. "deferred") signals.  If
you wish to handle a signal safely, use this accessor to set the "safe" flag
in the C<POSIX::SigAction> object:

	$sigaction->safe(1);

You may also examine the "safe" flag on the output action object which is
filled in when given as the third parameter to C<POSIX::sigaction()>:

	sigaction(SIGINT, $new_action, $old_action);
	if ($old_action->safe) {
	    # previous SIGINT handler used safe signals
	}

=back

=head2 POSIX::SigRt

=over 8

=item %SIGRT

A hash of the POSIX realtime signal handlers.  It is an extension of
the standard %SIG, the $POSIX::SIGRT{SIGRTMIN} is roughly equivalent
to $SIG{SIGRTMIN}, but the right POSIX moves (see below) are made with
the POSIX::SigSet and POSIX::sigaction instead of accessing the %SIG.

You can set the %POSIX::SIGRT elements to set the POSIX realtime
signal handlers, use C<delete> and C<exists> on the elements, and use
C<scalar> on the C<%POSIX::SIGRT> to find out how many POSIX realtime
signals there are available (SIGRTMAX - SIGRTMIN + 1, the SIGRTMAX is
a valid POSIX realtime signal).

Setting the %SIGRT elements is equivalent to calling this:

  sub new {
    my ($rtsig, $handler, $flags) = @@_;
    my $sigset = POSIX::SigSet($rtsig);
    my $sigact = POSIX::SigAction->new($handler, $sigset, $flags);
    sigaction($rtsig, $sigact);
  }

The flags default to zero, if you want something different you can
either use C<local> on $POSIX::SigRt::SIGACTION_FLAGS, or you can
derive from POSIX::SigRt and define your own C<new()> (the tied hash
STORE method of the %SIGRT calls C<new($rtsig, $handler, $SIGACTION_FLAGS)>,
where the $rtsig ranges from zero to SIGRTMAX - SIGRTMIN + 1).

Just as with any signal, you can use sigaction($rtsig, undef, $oa) to
retrieve the installed signal handler (or, rather, the signal action).

B<NOTE:> whether POSIX realtime signals really work in your system, or
whether Perl has been compiled so that it works with them, is outside
of this discussion.

=item SIGRTMIN

Return the minimum POSIX realtime signal number available, or C<undef>
if no POSIX realtime signals are available.

=item SIGRTMAX

Return the maximum POSIX realtime signal number available, or C<undef>
if no POSIX realtime signals are available.

=back

=head2 POSIX::SigSet

	$sigset->addset( &POSIX::SIGUSR2 );

Returns C<undef> on failure.

=item delset

		print "contains SIGUSR1\n";
	}

=back

=head2 POSIX::Termios

=over 8

=item new

Create a new Termios object.  This object will be destroyed automatically
when it is no longer needed.  A Termios object corresponds to the termios
C struct.  new() mallocs a new one, getattr() fills it from a file descriptor,
and setattr() sets a file descriptor's parameters to match Termios' contents.

	$termios = POSIX::Termios->new;

=item getattr

Get terminal control attributes.

Obtain the attributes for stdin.

	$termios->getattr( 0 ) # Recommended for clarity.
	$termios->getattr()

Set attributes immediately for stdout.

	$termios->setattr( 1, &POSIX::TCSANOW );

Returns C<undef> on failure.

=item setcc

The following will set the LC_CTYPE behaviour according to the locale
environment variables (the second argument C<"">).
Please see your systems L<setlocale(3)> documentation for the locale
environment variables' meaning or consult L<perllocale>.

	$loc = POSIX::setlocale( &POSIX::LC_CTYPE, "");

The following will set the LC_COLLATE behaviour to Argentinian
Spanish. B<NOTE>: The naming and availability of locales depends on
your operating system. Please consult L<perllocale> for how to find
out which locales are available in your system.

String to double translation. Returns the parsed number and the number
of characters in the unparsed portion of the string.  Truly
POSIX-compliant systems set $! ($ERRNO) to indicate a translation
error, so clear $! before calling strtod.  However, non-POSIX systems
may not check for overflow, and therefore will never set $!.

strtod should respect any POSIX I<setlocale()> settings.

To parse a string $str as a floating point number use

    $! = 0;
    ($num, $n_unparsed) = POSIX::strtod($str);

The second returned item and $! can be used to check for valid input:

    if (($str eq '') || ($n_unparsed != 0) || !$!) {
        die "Non-numeric input $str" . $! ? ": $!\n" : "\n";
    }

When called in a scalar context strtod returns the parsed number.
d1051 1

String to (long) integer translation.  Returns the parsed number and
the number of characters in the unparsed portion of the string.  Truly
POSIX-compliant systems set $! ($ERRNO) to indicate a translation
error, so clear $! before calling strtol.  However, non-POSIX systems
may not check for overflow, and therefore will never set $!.

strtol should respect any POSIX I<setlocale()> settings.

To parse a string $str as a number in some base $base use

    $! = 0;
    ($num, $n_unparsed) = POSIX::strtol($str, $base);

The base should be zero or between 2 and 36, inclusive.  When the base
is zero or omitted strtol will use the string itself to determine the
base: a leading "0x" or "0X" means hexadecimal; a leading "0" means
octal; any other leading characters mean decimal.  Thus, "1234" is
parsed as a decimal number, "01234" as an octal number, and "0x1234"
as a hexadecimal number.

The second returned item and $! can be used to check for valid input:

    if (($str eq '') || ($n_unparsed != 0) || !$!) {
        die "Non-numeric input $str" . $! ? ": $!\n" : "\n";
    }

When called in a scalar context strtol returns the parsed number.

=item strtoul

String to unsigned (long) integer translation.  strtoul is identical
to strtol except that strtoul only parses unsigned integers.  See
I<strtol> for details.

Note: Some vendors supply strtod and strtol but not strtoul.
Other vendors that do suply strtoul parse "-1" as a valid value.

standard (C89, to play safe).  These are C<aAbBcdHIjmMpSUwWxXyYZ%>.
But even then, the B<results> of some of the conversion specifiers are
non-portable.  For example, the specifiers C<aAbBcpZ> change according
to the locale settings of the user, and both how to set locales (the
locale names) and what output to expect are non-standard.
The specifier C<c> changes according to the timezone settings of the
user and the timezone computation rules of the operating system.
The C<Z> specifier is notoriously unportable since the names of
timezones are non-standard. Sticking to the numeric specifiers is the
safest route.

The given arguments are made consistent as though by calling
C<mktime()> before calling your system's C<strftime()> function,
except that the C<isdst> value is not affected.

Detailed signal management.  This uses C<POSIX::SigAction> objects for
the C<action> and C<oldaction> arguments (the oldaction can also be
just a hash reference).  Consult your system's C<sigaction> manpage
for details, see also C<POSIX::SigRt>.
a1131 29
If you use the SA_SIGINFO flag, the signal handler will in addition to
the first argument, the signal name, also receive a second argument, a
hash reference, inside which are the following keys with the following
semantics, as defined by POSIX/SUSv3:

    signo       the signal number
    errno       the error number
    code        if this is zero or less, the signal was sent by
                a user process and the uid and pid make sense,
                otherwise the signal was sent by the kernel

The following are also defined by POSIX/SUSv3, but unfortunately
not very widely implemented:

    pid         the process id generating the signal
    uid         the uid of the process id generating the signal
    status      exit value or signal for SIGCHLD
    band        band event for SIGPOLL

A third argument is also passed to the handler, which contains a copy
of the raw binary contents of the siginfo structure: if a system has
some non-POSIX fields, this third argument is where to unpack() them
from.

Note that not all siginfo values make sense simultaneously (some are
valid only for certain signals, for example), and not all values make
sense from Perl perspective, you should to consult your system's
C<sigaction> and possibly also C<siginfo> documentation.

=head2 POSIX::SigRt

=over 8

=item %SIGRT

A hash of the POSIX realtime signal handlers.  It is an extension of
the standard %SIG, the $POSIX::SIGRT{SIGRTMIN} is roughly equivalent
to $SIG{SIGRTMIN}, but the right POSIX moves (see below) are made with
the POSIX::SigSet and POSIX::sigaction instead of accessing the %SIG.

You can set the %POSIX::SIGRT elements to set the POSIX realtime
signal handlers, use C<delete> and C<exists> on the elements, and use
C<scalar> on the C<%POSIX::SIGRT> to find out how many POSIX realtime
signals there are available (SIGRTMAX - SIGRTMIN + 1, the SIGRTMAX is
a valid POSIX realtime signal).

Setting the %SIGRT elements is equivalent to calling this:

  sub new {
    my ($rtsig, $handler, $flags) = @@_;
    my $sigset = POSIX:SigSet($rtsig);
    my $sigact = POSIX::SigAction->new($handler, $sigset, $flags);
    sigaction($rtsig, $sigact);
  }

The flags default to zero, if you want something different you can
either use C<local> on $POSIX::RtSig::SIGACTION_FLAGS, or you can
derive from POSIX::SigRt and define your own C<new()> (the tied hash
STORE method of the %SIGRT calls C<new($rtsig, $handler, $SIGACTION_FLAGS)>,
where the $rtsig ranges from zero to SIGRTMAX - SIGRTMIN + 1).

Just as with any signal, you can use sigaction($rtsig, undef, $oa) to
retrieve the installed signal handler (or, rather, the signal action).

B<NOTE:> whether POSIX realtime signals really work in your system, or
whether Perl has been compiled so that it works with them, is outside
of this discussion.

=item SIGRTMIN

Return the minimum POSIX realtime signal number available, or C<undef>
if no POSIX realtime signals are available.

=item SIGRTMAX

Return the maximum POSIX realtime signal number available, or C<undef>
if no POSIX realtime signals are available.
