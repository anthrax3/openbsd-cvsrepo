perlport - Writing portable Perl

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Perl runs on numerous operating systems.  While most of them share
much in common, they also have their own unique features.

This document is meant to help you to find out what constitutes portable
Perl code.  That way once you make a decision to write portably,
you know where the lines are drawn, and you can stay within them.

There is a tradeoff between taking full advantage of one particular
type of computer and taking advantage of a full range of them.
Naturally, as you broaden your range and become more diverse, the
common factors drop, and you are left with an increasingly smaller
area of common ground in which you can operate to accomplish a
particular task.  Thus, when you begin attacking a problem, it is
important to consider under which part of the tradeoff curve you
want to operate.  Specifically, you must decide whether it is
important that the task that you are coding has the full generality
of being portable, or whether to just get the job done right now.
This is the hardest choice to be made.  The rest is easy, because
Perl provides many choices, whichever way you want to approach your
problem.

Looking at it another way, writing portable code is usually about
willfully limiting your available choices.  Naturally, it takes
discipline and sacrifice to do that.  The product of portability
and convenience may be a constant.  You have been warned.

Be aware of two important points:

=over 4

=item Not all Perl programs have to be portable

There is no reason you should not use Perl as a language to glue Unix
tools together, or to prototype a Macintosh application, or to manage the
Windows registry.  If it makes no sense to aim for portability for one
reason or another in a given program, then don't bother.

=item Nearly all of Perl already I<is> portable

Don't be fooled into thinking that it is hard to create portable Perl
code.  It isn't.  Perl tries its level-best to bridge the gaps between
what's available on different platforms, and all the means available to
use those features.  Thus almost all Perl code runs on any machine
without modification.  But there are some significant issues in
writing portable code, and this document is entirely about those issues.

=back

Here's the general rule: When you approach a task commonly done
using a whole range of platforms, think about writing portable
code.  That way, you don't sacrifice much by way of the implementation
choices you can avail yourself of, and at the same time you can give
your users lots of platform choices.  On the other hand, when you have to
take advantage of some unique feature of a particular platform, as is
often the case with systems programming (whether for Unix, Windows,
VMS, etc.), consider writing platform-specific code.

When the code will run on only two or three operating systems, you
may need to consider only the differences of those particular systems.
The important thing is to decide where the code will run and to be
deliberate in your decision.

The material below is separated into three main sections: main issues of
portability (L<"ISSUES">), platform-specific issues (L<"PLATFORMS">), and
built-in Perl functions that behave differently on various ports
(L<"FUNCTION IMPLEMENTATIONS">).

This information should not be considered complete; it includes possibly
transient information about idiosyncrasies of some of the ports, almost
all of which are in a state of constant evolution.  Thus, this material
should be considered a perpetual work in progress
(C<< <IMG SRC="yellow_sign.gif" ALT="Under Construction"> >>).

=head1 ISSUES

=head2 Newlines

In most operating systems, lines in files are terminated by newlines.
Just what is used as a newline may vary from OS to OS.  Unix
traditionally uses C<\012>, one type of DOSish I/O uses C<\015\012>,
S<Mac OS> uses C<\015>, and z/OS uses C<\025>.

Perl uses C<\n> to represent the "logical" newline, where what is
logical may depend on the platform in use.  In MacPerl, C<\n> always
means C<\015>.  On EBCDIC platforms, C<\n> could be C<\025> or C<\045>.
In DOSish perls, C<\n> usually means C<\012>, but when
accessing a file in "text" mode, perl uses the C<:crlf> layer that
translates it to (or from) C<\015\012>, depending on whether you're
reading or writing. Unix does the same thing on ttys in canonical
mode.  C<\015\012> is commonly referred to as CRLF.

To trim trailing newlines from text lines use C<chomp()>.  With default
settings that function looks for a trailing C<\n> character and thus
trims in a portable way.

When dealing with binary files (or text files in binary mode) be sure
to explicitly set $/ to the appropriate value for your file format
before using C<chomp()>.

Because of the "text" mode translation, DOSish perls have limitations
in using C<seek> and C<tell> on a file accessed in "text" mode.
Stick to C<seek>-ing to locations you got from C<tell> (and no
others), and you are usually free to use C<seek> and C<tell> even
in "text" mode.  Using C<seek> or C<tell> or other file operations
may be non-portable.  If you use C<binmode> on a file, however, you
can usually C<seek> and C<tell> with arbitrary values safely.

A common misconception in socket programming is that S<C<\n eq \012>>
everywhere.  When using protocols such as common Internet protocols,
C<\012> and C<\015> are called for specifically, and the values of
the logical C<\n> and C<\r> (carriage return) are not reliable.

    print SOCKET "Hi there, client!\r\n";      # WRONG
    print SOCKET "Hi there, client!\015\012";  # RIGHT

However, using C<\015\012> (or C<\cM\cJ>, or C<\x0D\x0A>) can be tedious
and unsightly, as well as confusing to those maintaining the code.  As
such, the C<Socket> module supplies the Right Thing for those who want it.

    use Socket qw(:DEFAULT :crlf);
    print SOCKET "Hi there, client!$CRLF"      # RIGHT

When reading from a socket, remember that the default input record
separator C<$/> is C<\n>, but robust socket code will recognize as
either C<\012> or C<\015\012> as end of line:

    while (<SOCKET>) {  # NOT ADVISABLE!
        # ...
    }

Because both CRLF and LF end in LF, the input record separator can
be set to LF and any CR stripped later.  Better to write:

    use Socket qw(:DEFAULT :crlf);
    local($/) = LF;      # not needed if $/ is already \012

    while (<SOCKET>) {
        s/$CR?$LF/\n/;   # not sure if socket uses LF or CRLF, OK
    #   s/\015?\012/\n/; # same thing
    }

This example is preferred over the previous one--even for Unix
platforms--because now any C<\015>'s (C<\cM>'s) are stripped out
(and there was much rejoicing).

Similarly, functions that return text data--such as a function that
fetches a web page--should sometimes translate newlines before
returning the data, if they've not yet been translated to the local
newline representation.  A single line of code will often suffice:

    $data =~ s/\015?\012/\n/g;
    return $data;

Some of this may be confusing.  Here's a handy reference to the ASCII CR
and LF characters.  You can print it out and stick it in your wallet.

    LF  eq  \012  eq  \x0A  eq  \cJ  eq  chr(10)  eq  ASCII 10
    CR  eq  \015  eq  \x0D  eq  \cM  eq  chr(13)  eq  ASCII 13

             | Unix | DOS  | Mac  |
        ---------------------------
        \n   |  LF  |  LF  |  CR  |
        \r   |  CR  |  CR  |  LF  |
        \n * |  LF  | CRLF |  CR  |
        \r * |  CR  |  CR  |  LF  |
        ---------------------------
        * text-mode STDIO

The Unix column assumes that you are not accessing a serial line
(like a tty) in canonical mode.  If you are, then CR on input becomes
"\n", and "\n" on output becomes CRLF.

These are just the most common definitions of C<\n> and C<\r> in Perl.
There may well be others.  For example, on an EBCDIC implementation
such as z/OS (OS/390) or OS/400 (using the ILE, the PASE is ASCII-based)
the above material is similar to "Unix" but the code numbers change:

    LF  eq  \025  eq  \x15  eq  \cU  eq  chr(21)  eq  CP-1047 21
    LF  eq  \045  eq  \x25  eq           chr(37)  eq  CP-0037 37
    CR  eq  \015  eq  \x0D  eq  \cM  eq  chr(13)  eq  CP-1047 13
    CR  eq  \015  eq  \x0D  eq  \cM  eq  chr(13)  eq  CP-0037 13

             | z/OS | OS/400 |
        ----------------------
        \n   |  LF  |  LF    |
        \r   |  CR  |  CR    |
        \n * |  LF  |  LF    |
        \r * |  CR  |  CR    |
        ----------------------
        * text-mode STDIO

=head2 Numbers endianness and Width

Different CPUs store integers and floating point numbers in different
orders (called I<endianness>) and widths (32-bit and 64-bit being the
most common today).  This affects your programs when they attempt to transfer
numbers in binary format from one CPU architecture to another,
usually either "live" via network connection, or by storing the
numbers to secondary storage such as a disk file or tape.

Conflicting storage orders make an utter mess out of the numbers.  If a
little-endian host (Intel, VAX) stores 0x12345678 (305419896 in
decimal), a big-endian host (Motorola, Sparc, PA) reads it as
0x78563412 (2018915346 in decimal).  Alpha and MIPS can be either:
Digital/Compaq used/uses them in little-endian mode; SGI/Cray uses
them in big-endian mode.  To avoid this problem in network (socket)
connections use the C<pack> and C<unpack> formats C<n> and C<N>, the
"network" orders.  These are guaranteed to be portable.

As of Perl 5.10.0, you can also use the C<E<gt>> and C<E<lt>> modifiers
to force big- or little-endian byte-order.  This is useful if you want
to store signed integers or 64-bit integers, for example.

You can explore the endianness of your platform by unpacking a
data structure packed in native format such as:

    print unpack("h*", pack("s2", 1, 2)), "\n";
    # '10002000' on e.g. Intel x86 or Alpha 21064 in little-endian mode
    # '00100020' on e.g. Motorola 68040

If you need to distinguish between endian architectures you could use
either of the variables set like so:

    $is_big_endian   = unpack("h*", pack("s", 1)) =~ /01/;
    $is_little_endian = unpack("h*", pack("s", 1)) =~ /^1/;

Differing widths can cause truncation even between platforms of equal
endianness.  The platform of shorter width loses the upper parts of the
number.  There is no good solution for this problem except to avoid
transferring or storing raw binary numbers.

One can circumnavigate both these problems in two ways.  Either
transfer and store numbers always in text format, instead of raw
binary, or else consider using modules like C<Data::Dumper> and
C<Storable>
(included as of Perl 5.8).  Keeping all data as text significantly
simplifies matters.

=head2 Files and Filesystems

Most platforms these days structure files in a hierarchical fashion.
So, it is reasonably safe to assume that all platforms support the
notion of a "path" to uniquely identify a file on the system.  How
that path is really written, though, differs considerably.

Although similar, file path specifications differ between Unix,
Windows, S<Mac OS>, OS/2, VMS, VOS, S<RISC OS>, and probably others.
Unix, for example, is one of the few OSes that has the elegant idea
of a single root directory.

DOS, OS/2, VMS, VOS, and Windows can work similarly to Unix with C</>
as path separator, or in their own idiosyncratic ways (such as having
several root directories and various "unrooted" device files such NIL:
and LPT:).

S<Mac OS> 9 and earlier used C<:> as a path separator instead of C</>.

The filesystem may support neither hard links (C<link>) nor
symbolic links (C<symlink>, C<readlink>, C<lstat>).

The filesystem may support neither access timestamp nor change
timestamp (meaning that about the only portable timestamp is the
modification timestamp), or one second granularity of any timestamps
(e.g. the FAT filesystem limits the time granularity to two seconds).

The "inode change timestamp" (the C<-C> filetest) may really be the
"creation timestamp" (which it is not in Unix).

VOS perl can emulate Unix filenames with C</> as path separator.  The
native pathname characters greater-than, less-than, number-sign, and
percent-sign are always accepted.

S<RISC OS> perl can emulate Unix filenames with C</> as path
separator, or go native and use C<.> for path separator and C<:> to
signal filesystems and disk names.

Don't assume Unix filesystem access semantics: that read, write,
and execute are all the permissions there are, and even if they exist,
that their semantics (for example what do C<"r">, C<"w">, and C<"x"> mean on
a directory) are the Unix ones.  The various Unix/POSIX compatibility
layers usually try to make interfaces like C<chmod()> work, but sometimes
there simply is no good mapping.

The C<File::Spec> modules provide methods to manipulate path
specifications and return the results in native format for each
platform.  This is often unnecessary as Unix-style paths are
understood by Perl on every supported platform, but if you need to
produce native paths for a native utility that does not understand
Unix syntax, or if you are operating on paths or path components
in unknown (and thus possibly native) syntax, C<File::Spec> is
your friend.  Here are two brief examples:

    use File::Spec::Functions;
    chdir(updir());        # go up one directory

    # Concatenate a path from its components
    my $file = catfile(updir(), 'temp', 'file.txt');
    # on Unix:    '../temp/file.txt'
    # on Win32:   '..\temp\file.txt'
    # on VMS:     '[-.temp]file.txt'

In general, production code should not have file paths hardcoded.
Making them user-supplied or read from a configuration file is
better, keeping in mind that file path syntax varies on different
machines.

This is especially noticeable in scripts like Makefiles and test suites,
which often assume C</> as a path separator for subdirectories.

Also of use is C<File::Basename> from the standard distribution, which
splits a pathname into pieces (base filename, full path to directory,
and file suffix).

Even when on a single platform (if you can call Unix a single platform),
remember not to count on the existence or the contents of particular
system-specific files or directories, like F</etc/passwd>,
F</etc/sendmail.conf>, F</etc/resolv.conf>, or even F</tmp/>.  For
example, F</etc/passwd> may exist but not contain the encrypted
passwords, because the system is using some form of enhanced security.
Or it may not contain all the accounts, because the system is using NIS.
If code does need to rely on such a file, include a description of the
file and its format in the code's documentation, then make it easy for
the user to override the default location of the file.

Don't assume a text file will end with a newline.  They should,
but people forget.

Do not have two files or directories of the same name with different
case, like F<test.pl> and F<Test.pl>, as many platforms have
case-insensitive (or at least case-forgiving) filenames.  Also, try
not to have non-word characters (except for C<.>) in the names, and
keep them to the 8.3 convention, for maximum portability, onerous a
burden though this may appear.

Likewise, when using the C<AutoSplit> module, try to keep your functions to
8.3 naming and case-insensitive conventions; or, at the least,
make it so the resulting files have a unique (case-insensitively)
first 8 characters.

Whitespace in filenames is tolerated on most systems, but not all,
and even on systems where it might be tolerated, some utilities
might become confused by such whitespace.

Many systems (DOS, VMS ODS-2) cannot have more than one C<.> in their
filenames.

Don't assume C<< > >> won't be the first character of a filename.
Always use C<< < >> explicitly to open a file for reading, or even
better, use the three-arg version of C<open>, unless you want the user to
be able to specify a pipe open.

    open my $fh, '<', $existing_file) or die $!;

If filenames might use strange characters, it is safest to open it
with C<sysopen> instead of C<open>.  C<open> is magic and can
translate characters like C<< > >>, C<< < >>, and C<|>, which may
be the wrong thing to do.  (Sometimes, though, it's the right thing.)
Three-arg open can also help protect against this translation in cases
where it is undesirable.

Don't use C<:> as a part of a filename since many systems use that for
their own semantics (Mac OS Classic for separating pathname components,
many networking schemes and utilities for separating the nodename and
the pathname, and so on).  For the same reasons, avoid C<@@>, C<;> and
C<|>.

Don't assume that in pathnames you can collapse two leading slashes
C<//> into one: some networking and clustering filesystems have special
semantics for that.  Let the operating system sort it out.

The I<portable filename characters> as defined by ANSI C are

 a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z
 A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z
 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
 . _ -

and the C<"-"> shouldn't be the first character.  If you want to be
hypercorrect, stay case-insensitive and within the 8.3 naming
convention (all the files and directories have to be unique within one
directory if their names are lowercased and truncated to eight
characters before the C<.>, if any, and to three characters after the
C<.>, if any).  (And do not use C<.>s in directory names.)

=head2 System Interaction

Not all platforms provide a command line.  These are usually platforms
that rely primarily on a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for user
interaction.  A program requiring a command line interface might
not work everywhere.  This is probably for the user of the program
to deal with, so don't stay up late worrying about it.

Some platforms can't delete or rename files held open by the system,
this limitation may also apply to changing filesystem metainformation
like file permissions or owners.  Remember to C<close> files when you
are done with them.  Don't C<unlink> or C<rename> an open file.  Don't
C<tie> or C<open> a file already tied or opened; C<untie> or C<close>
it first.

Don't open the same file more than once at a time for writing, as some
operating systems put mandatory locks on such files.

Don't assume that write/modify permission on a directory gives the
right to add or delete files/directories in that directory.  That is
filesystem specific: in some filesystems you need write/modify
permission also (or even just) in the file/directory itself.  In some
filesystems (AFS, DFS) the permission to add/delete directory entries
is a completely separate permission.

Don't assume that a single C<unlink> completely gets rid of the file:
some filesystems (most notably the ones in VMS) have versioned
filesystems, and C<unlink()> removes only the most recent one (it doesn't
remove all the versions because by default the native tools on those
platforms remove just the most recent version, too).  The portable
idiom to remove all the versions of a file is

    1 while unlink "file";

This will terminate if the file is undeleteable for some reason
(protected, not there, and so on).

Don't count on a specific environment variable existing in C<%ENV>.
Don't count on C<%ENV> entries being case-sensitive, or even
case-preserving.  Don't try to clear C<%ENV> by saying C<%ENV = ();>, or,
if you really have to, make it conditional on C<$^O ne 'VMS'> since in
VMS the C<%ENV> table is much more than a per-process key-value string
table.

On VMS, some entries in the C<%ENV> hash are dynamically created when
their key is used on a read if they did not previously exist.  The
values for C<$ENV{HOME}>, C<$ENV{TERM}>, C<$ENV{PATH}>, and C<$ENV{USER}>,
are known to be dynamically generated.  The specific names that are
dynamically generated may vary with the version of the C library on VMS,
and more may exist than are documented.

On VMS by default, changes to the %ENV hash persist after perl exits.
Subsequent invocations of perl in the same process can inadvertently
inherit environment settings that were meant to be temporary.

Don't count on signals or C<%SIG> for anything.

Don't count on filename globbing.  Use C<opendir>, C<readdir>, and
C<closedir> instead.

Don't count on per-program environment variables, or per-program current
directories.

Don't count on specific values of C<$!>, neither numeric nor
especially the string values. Users may switch their locales causing
error messages to be translated into their languages.  If you can
trust a POSIXish environment, you can portably use the symbols defined
by the C<Errno> module, like C<ENOENT>.  And don't trust on the values of C<$!>
at all except immediately after a failed system call.

=head2 Command names versus file pathnames

Don't assume that the name used to invoke a command or program with
C<system> or C<exec> can also be used to test for the existence of the
file that holds the executable code for that command or program.
First, many systems have "internal" commands that are built-in to the
shell or OS and while these commands can be invoked, there is no
corresponding file.  Second, some operating systems (e.g., Cygwin,
DJGPP, OS/2, and VOS) have required suffixes for executable files;
these suffixes are generally permitted on the command name but are not
required.  Thus, a command like F<"perl"> might exist in a file named
F<"perl">, F<"perl.exe">, or F<"perl.pm">, depending on the operating system.
The variable C<"_exe"> in the C<Config> module holds the executable suffix,
if any.  Third, the VMS port carefully sets up C<$^X> and
C<$Config{perlpath}> so that no further processing is required.  This is
just as well, because the matching regular expression used below would
then have to deal with a possible trailing version number in the VMS
file name.

To convert C<$^X> to a file pathname, taking account of the requirements
of the various operating system possibilities, say:

 use Config;
 my $thisperl = $^X;
 if ($^O ne 'VMS')
    {$thisperl .= $Config{_exe} unless $thisperl =~ m/$Config{_exe}$/i;}

To convert C<$Config{perlpath}> to a file pathname, say:

 use Config;
 my $thisperl = $Config{perlpath};
 if ($^O ne 'VMS')
    {$thisperl .= $Config{_exe} unless $thisperl =~ m/$Config{_exe}$/i;}

=head2 Networking

Don't assume that you can reach the public Internet.

Don't assume that there is only one way to get through firewalls
to the public Internet.

Don't assume that you can reach outside world through any other port
than 80, or some web proxy.  ftp is blocked by many firewalls.

Don't assume that you can send email by connecting to the local SMTP port.

Don't assume that you can reach yourself or any node by the name
'localhost'.  The same goes for '127.0.0.1'.  You will have to try both.

Don't assume that the host has only one network card, or that it
can't bind to many virtual IP addresses.

Don't assume a particular network device name.

Don't assume a particular set of C<ioctl()>s will work.

Don't assume that you can ping hosts and get replies.

Don't assume that any particular port (service) will respond.

Don't assume that C<Sys::Hostname> (or any other API or command) returns
either a fully qualified hostname or a non-qualified hostname: it all
depends on how the system had been configured.  Also remember that for
things such as DHCP and NAT, the hostname you get back might not be
very useful.

All the above I<don't>s may look daunting, and they are, but the key
is to degrade gracefully if one cannot reach the particular network
service one wants.  Croaking or hanging do not look very professional.

=head2 Interprocess Communication (IPC)

In general, don't directly access the system in code meant to be
portable.  That means, no C<system>, C<exec>, C<fork>, C<pipe>,
C<``>, C<qx//>, C<open> with a C<|>, nor any of the other things
that makes being a Perl hacker worth being.

Commands that launch external processes are generally supported on
most platforms (though many of them do not support any type of
forking).  The problem with using them arises from what you invoke
them on.  External tools are often named differently on different
platforms, may not be available in the same location, might accept
different arguments, can behave differently, and often present their
results in a platform-dependent way.  Thus, you should seldom depend
on them to produce consistent results. (Then again, if you're calling
I<netstat -a>, you probably don't expect it to run on both Unix and CP/M.)

One especially common bit of Perl code is opening a pipe to B<sendmail>:

    open(MAIL, '|/usr/lib/sendmail -t')
	or die "cannot fork sendmail: $!";

This is fine for systems programming when sendmail is known to be
available.  But it is not fine for many non-Unix systems, and even
some Unix systems that may not have sendmail installed.  If a portable
solution is needed, see the various distributions on CPAN that deal
with it.  C<Mail::Mailer> and C<Mail::Send> in the C<MailTools> distribution are
commonly used, and provide several mailing methods, including C<mail>,
C<sendmail>, and direct SMTP (via C<Net::SMTP>) if a mail transfer agent is
not available.  C<Mail::Sendmail> is a standalone module that provides
simple, platform-independent mailing.

The Unix System V IPC (C<msg*(), sem*(), shm*()>) is not available
even on all Unix platforms.

Do not use either the bare result of C<pack("N", 10, 20, 30, 40)> or
bare v-strings (such as C<v10.20.30.40>) to represent IPv4 addresses:
both forms just pack the four bytes into network order.  That this
would be equal to the C language C<in_addr> struct (which is what the
socket code internally uses) is not guaranteed.  To be portable use
the routines of the C<Socket> extension, such as C<inet_aton()>,
C<inet_ntoa()>, and C<sockaddr_in()>.

The rule of thumb for portable code is: Do it all in portable Perl, or
use a module (that may internally implement it with platform-specific
code, but exposes a common interface).

=head2 External Subroutines (XS)

XS code can usually be made to work with any platform, but dependent
libraries, header files, etc., might not be readily available or
portable, or the XS code itself might be platform-specific, just as Perl
code might be.  If the libraries and headers are portable, then it is
normally reasonable to make sure the XS code is portable, too.

A different type of portability issue arises when writing XS code:
availability of a C compiler on the end-user's system.  C brings
with it its own portability issues, and writing XS code will expose
you to some of those.  Writing purely in Perl is an easier way to
achieve portability.

=head2 Standard Modules

In general, the standard modules work across platforms.  Notable
exceptions are the C<CPAN> module (which currently makes connections to external
programs that may not be available), platform-specific modules (like
C<ExtUtils::MM_VMS>), and DBM modules.

There is no one DBM module available on all platforms.
C<SDBM_File> and the others are generally available on all Unix and DOSish
ports, but not in MacPerl, where only C<NDBM_File> and C<DB_File> are
available.

The good news is that at least some DBM module should be available, and
C<AnyDBM_File> will use whichever module it can find.  Of course, then
the code needs to be fairly strict, dropping to the greatest common
factor (e.g., not exceeding 1K for each record), so that it will
work with any DBM module.  See L<AnyDBM_File> for more details.

=head2 Time and Date

The system's notion of time of day and calendar date is controlled in
widely different ways.  Don't assume the timezone is stored in C<$ENV{TZ}>,
and even if it is, don't assume that you can control the timezone through
that variable.  Don't assume anything about the three-letter timezone
abbreviations (for example that MST would be the Mountain Standard Time,
it's been known to stand for Moscow Standard Time).  If you need to
use timezones, express them in some unambiguous format like the
exact number of minutes offset from UTC, or the POSIX timezone
format.

Don't assume that the epoch starts at 00:00:00, January 1, 1970,
because that is OS- and implementation-specific.  It is better to
store a date in an unambiguous representation.  The ISO 8601 standard
defines YYYY-MM-DD as the date format, or YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS
(that's a literal "T" separating the date from the time).
Please do use the ISO 8601 instead of making us guess what
date 02/03/04 might be.  ISO 8601 even sorts nicely as-is.
A text representation (like "1987-12-18") can be easily converted
into an OS-specific value using a module like C<Date::Parse>.
An array of values, such as those returned by C<localtime>, can be
converted to an OS-specific representation using C<Time::Local>.

When calculating specific times, such as for tests in time or date modules,
it may be appropriate to calculate an offset for the epoch.

    require Time::Local;
    my $offset = Time::Local::timegm(0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 70);

The value for C<$offset> in Unix will be C<0>, but in Mac OS Classic
will be some large number.  C<$offset> can then be added to a Unix time
value to get what should be the proper value on any system.

=head2 Character sets and character encoding

Assume very little about character sets.

Assume nothing about numerical values (C<ord>, C<chr>) of characters.
Do not use explicit code point ranges (like C<\xHH-\xHH)>.  However,
starting in Perl v5.22, regular expression pattern bracketed character
class ranges specified like C<qr/[\N{U+HH}-\N{U+HH}]/> are portable,
and starting in Perl v5.24, the same ranges are portable in C<tr///>.
You can portably use symbolic character classes like C<[:print:]>.

Do not assume that the alphabetic characters are encoded contiguously
(in the numeric sense).  There may be gaps.  Special coding in Perl,
however, guarantees that all subsets of C<qr/[A-Z]/>, C<qr/[a-z]/>, and
C<qr/[0-9]/> behave as expected.  C<tr///> behaves the same for these
ranges.  In patterns, any ranges specified with end points using the
C<\N{...}> notations ensures character set portability, but it is a bug
in Perl v5.22, that this isn't true of C<tr///>, fixed in v5.24.

Do not assume anything about the ordering of the characters.
The lowercase letters may come before or after the uppercase letters;
the lowercase and uppercase may be interlaced so that both "a" and "A"
come before "b"; the accented and other international characters may
be interlaced so that E<auml> comes before "b".
L<Unicode::Collate> can be used to sort this all out.

=head2 Internationalisation

If you may assume POSIX (a rather large assumption), you may read
more about the POSIX locale system from L<perllocale>.  The locale
system at least attempts to make things a little bit more portable,
or at least more convenient and native-friendly for non-English
users.  The system affects character sets and encoding, and date
and time formatting--amongst other things.

If you really want to be international, you should consider Unicode.
See L<perluniintro> and L<perlunicode> for more information.

If you want to use non-ASCII bytes (outside the bytes 0x00..0x7f) in
the "source code" of your code, to be portable you have to be explicit
about what bytes they are.  Someone might for example be using your
code under a UTF-8 locale, in which case random native bytes might be
illegal ("Malformed UTF-8 ...")  This means that for example embedding
ISO 8859-1 bytes beyond 0x7f into your strings might cause trouble
later.  If the bytes are native 8-bit bytes, you can use the C<bytes>
pragma.  If the bytes are in a string (regular expressions being
curious strings), you can often also use the C<\xHH> or more portably,
the C<\N{U+HH}> notations instead
of embedding the bytes as-is.  If you want to write your code in UTF-8,
you can use L<utf8>.

=head2 System Resources

If your code is destined for systems with severely constrained (or
missing!) virtual memory systems then you want to be I<especially> mindful
of avoiding wasteful constructs such as:

    my @@lines = <$very_large_file>;            # bad

    while (<$fh>) {$file .= $_}                # sometimes bad
    my $file = join('', <$fh>);                # better

The last two constructs may appear unintuitive to most people.  The
first repeatedly grows a string, whereas the second allocates a
large chunk of memory in one go.  On some systems, the second is
more efficient than the first.

=head2 Security

Most multi-user platforms provide basic levels of security, usually
implemented at the filesystem level.  Some, however, unfortunately do
not.  Thus the notion of user id, or "home" directory,
or even the state of being logged-in, may be unrecognizable on many
platforms.  If you write programs that are security-conscious, it
is usually best to know what type of system you will be running
under so that you can write code explicitly for that platform (or
class of platforms).

Don't assume the Unix filesystem access semantics: the operating
system or the filesystem may be using some ACL systems, which are
richer languages than the usual C<rwx>.  Even if the C<rwx> exist,
their semantics might be different.

(From the security viewpoint, testing for permissions before attempting to
do something is silly anyway: if one tries this, there is potential
for race conditions. Someone or something might change the
permissions between the permissions check and the actual operation.
Just try the operation.)

Don't assume the Unix user and group semantics: especially, don't
expect C<< $< >> and C<< $> >> (or C<$(> and C<$)>) to work
for switching identities (or memberships).

Don't assume set-uid and set-gid semantics. (And even if you do,
think twice: set-uid and set-gid are a known can of security worms.)

=head2 Style

For those times when it is necessary to have platform-specific code,
consider keeping the platform-specific code in one place, making porting
to other platforms easier.  Use the C<Config> module and the special
variable C<$^O> to differentiate platforms, as described in
L<"PLATFORMS">.

Beware of the "else syndrome":

  if ($^O eq 'MSWin32') {
    # code that assumes Windows
  } else {
    # code that assumes Linux
  }

The C<else> branch should be used for the really ultimate fallback,
not for code specific to some platform.

Be careful in the tests you supply with your module or programs.
Module code may be fully portable, but its tests might not be.  This
often happens when tests spawn off other processes or call external
programs to aid in the testing, or when (as noted above) the tests
assume certain things about the filesystem and paths.  Be careful not
to depend on a specific output style for errors, such as when checking
C<$!> after a failed system call.  Using C<$!> for anything else than
displaying it as output is doubtful (though see the C<Errno> module for
testing reasonably portably for error value). Some platforms expect
a certain output format, and Perl on those platforms may have been
adjusted accordingly.  Most specifically, don't anchor a regex when
testing an error value.

=head1 CPAN Testers

Modules uploaded to CPAN are tested by a variety of volunteers on
different platforms.  These CPAN testers are notified by mail of each
new upload, and reply to the list with PASS, FAIL, NA (not applicable to
this platform), or UNKNOWN (unknown), along with any relevant notations.

The purpose of the testing is twofold: one, to help developers fix any
problems in their code that crop up because of lack of testing on other
platforms; two, to provide users with information about whether
a given module works on a given platform.

=head1 PLATFORMS

Perl is built with a C<$^O> variable that indicates the operating
system it was built on.  This was implemented
to help speed up code that would otherwise have to C<use Config>
and use the value of C<$Config{osname}>.  Of course, to get more
detailed information about the system, looking into C<%Config> is
certainly recommended.

C<%Config> cannot always be trusted, however, because it was built
at compile time.  If perl was built in one place, then transferred
elsewhere, some values may be wrong.  The values may even have been
edited after the fact.

=head2 Unix

Perl works on a bewildering variety of Unix and Unix-like platforms (see
e.g. most of the files in the F<hints/> directory in the source code kit).
On most of these systems, the value of C<$^O> (hence C<$Config{'osname'}>,
too) is determined either by lowercasing and stripping punctuation from the
first field of the string returned by typing C<uname -a> (or a similar command)
at the shell prompt or by testing the file system for the presence of
uniquely named files such as a kernel or header file.  Here, for example,
are a few of the more popular Unix flavors:

    uname         $^O        $Config{'archname'}
    --------------------------------------------
    AIX           aix        aix

    SunOS         solaris    i86pc-solaris
    SunOS4        sunos      sun4-sunos

Because the value of C<$Config{archname}> may depend on the
hardware architecture, it can vary more than the value of C<$^O>.

=head2 DOS and Derivatives

Perl has long been ported to Intel-style microcomputers running under
systems like PC-DOS, MS-DOS, OS/2, and most Windows platforms you can
bring yourself to mention (except for Windows CE, if you count that).
Users familiar with I<COMMAND.COM> or I<CMD.EXE> style shells should
be aware that each of these file specifications may have subtle
differences:

    my $filespec0 = "c:/foo/bar/file.txt";
    my $filespec1 = "c:\\foo\\bar\\file.txt";
    my $filespec2 = 'c:\foo\bar\file.txt';
    my $filespec3 = 'c:\\foo\\bar\\file.txt';

System calls accept either C</> or C<\> as the path separator.
However, many command-line utilities of DOS vintage treat C</> as
the option prefix, so may get confused by filenames containing C</>.
Aside from calling any external programs, C</> will work just fine,
and probably better, as it is more consistent with popular usage,
and avoids the problem of remembering what to backwhack and what
not to.

The DOS FAT filesystem can accommodate only "8.3" style filenames.  Under
the "case-insensitive, but case-preserving" HPFS (OS/2) and NTFS (NT)
filesystems you may have to be careful about case returned with functions
like C<readdir> or used with functions like C<open> or C<opendir>.

DOS also treats several filenames as special, such as AUX, PRN,
NUL, CON, COM1, LPT1, LPT2, etc.  Unfortunately, sometimes these
filenames won't even work if you include an explicit directory
prefix.  It is best to avoid such filenames, if you want your code
to be portable to DOS and its derivatives.  It's hard to know what
these all are, unfortunately.

Users of these operating systems may also wish to make use of
scripts such as I<pl2bat.bat> or I<pl2cmd> to
put wrappers around your scripts.

Newline (C<\n>) is translated as C<\015\012> by STDIO when reading from
and writing to files (see L<"Newlines">).  C<binmode(FILEHANDLE)>
will keep C<\n> translated as C<\012> for that filehandle.  Since it is a
no-op on other systems, C<binmode> should be used for cross-platform code
that deals with binary data.  That's assuming you realize in advance
that your data is in binary.  General-purpose programs should
often assume nothing about their data.

The C<$^O> variable and the C<$Config{archname}> values for various
DOSish perls are as follows:

     OS            $^O      $Config{archname}   ID    Version
     --------------------------------------------------------
     MS-DOS        dos        ?
     PC-DOS        dos        ?

     Windows CE    MSWin32    ?                 3
     Cygwin        cygwin     cygwin

The various MSWin32 Perl's can distinguish the OS they are running on
via the value of the fifth element of the list returned from
C<Win32::GetOSVersion()>.  For example:

    if ($^O eq 'MSWin32') {
        my @@os_version_info = Win32::GetOSVersion();
        print +('3.1','95','NT')[$os_version_info[4]],"\n";

=head2 VMS

Perl on VMS is discussed in L<perlvms> in the Perl distribution.

The official name of VMS as of this writing is OpenVMS.

Interacting with Perl from the Digital Command Language (DCL) shell
often requires a different set of quotation marks than Unix shells do.
For example:

    $ perl -e "print ""Hello, world.\n"""
    Hello, world.

There are several ways to wrap your Perl scripts in DCL F<.COM> files, if
you are so inclined.  For example:

    $ write sys$output "Hello from DCL!"
    $ if p1 .eqs. ""
    $ then perl -x 'f$environment("PROCEDURE")
    $ else perl -x - 'p1 'p2 'p3 'p4 'p5 'p6 'p7 'p8
    $ deck/dollars="__END__"
    #!/usr/bin/perl

    print "Hello from Perl!\n";

    __END__
    $ endif

Do take care with C<$ ASSIGN/nolog/user SYS$COMMAND: SYS$INPUT> if your
Perl-in-DCL script expects to do things like C<< $read = <STDIN>; >>.

The VMS operating system has two filesystems, designated by their
on-disk structure (ODS) level: ODS-2 and its successor ODS-5.  The
initial port of Perl to VMS pre-dates ODS-5, but all current testing and
development assumes ODS-5 and its capabilities, including case
preservation, extended characters in filespecs, and names up to 8192
bytes long.

Perl on VMS can accept either VMS- or Unix-style file
specifications as in either of the following:

    $ perl -ne "print if /perl_setup/i" SYS$LOGIN:LOGIN.COM
    $ perl -ne "print if /perl_setup/i" /sys$login/login.com

but not a mixture of both as in:

    $ perl -ne "print if /perl_setup/i" sys$login:/login.com
    Can't open sys$login:/login.com: file specification syntax error

In general, the easiest path to portability is always to specify
filenames in Unix format unless they will need to be processed by native
commands or utilities.  Because of this latter consideration, the
File::Spec module by default returns native format specifications
regardless of input format.  This default may be reversed so that
filenames are always reported in Unix format by specifying the
C<DECC$FILENAME_UNIX_REPORT> feature logical in the environment.

The file type, or extension, is always present in a VMS-format file
specification even if it's zero-length.  This means that, by default,
C<readdir> will return a trailing dot on a file with no extension, so
where you would see C<"a"> on Unix you'll see C<"a."> on VMS.  However,
the trailing dot may be suppressed by enabling the
C<DECC$READDIR_DROPDOTNOTYPE> feature in the environment (see the CRTL
documentation on feature logical names).

What C<\n> represents depends on the type of file opened.  It usually
represents C<\012> but it could also be C<\015>, C<\012>, C<\015\012>,
C<\000>, C<\040>, or nothing depending on the file organization and
record format.  The C<VMS::Stdio> module provides access to the
special C<fopen()> requirements of files with unusual attributes on VMS.

The value of C<$^O> on OpenVMS is "VMS".  To determine the architecture
that you are running on refer to C<$Config{'archname'}>.

On VMS, perl determines the UTC offset from the C<SYS$TIMEZONE_DIFFERENTIAL>
logical name.  Although the VMS epoch began at 17-NOV-1858 00:00:00.00,
calls to C<localtime> are adjusted to count offsets from
01-JAN-1970 00:00:00.00, just like Unix.

=head2 VOS

Perl on VOS (also known as OpenVOS) is discussed in F<README.vos>
in the Perl distribution (installed as L<perlvos>).  Perl on VOS
can accept either VOS- or Unix-style file specifications as in
either of the following:

    $ perl -ne "print if /perl_setup/i" >system>notices
    $ perl -ne "print if /perl_setup/i" /system/notices

or even a mixture of both as in:

    $ perl -ne "print if /perl_setup/i" >system/notices

Even though VOS allows the slash character to appear in object
names, because the VOS port of Perl interprets it as a pathname
delimiting character, VOS files, directories, or links whose
names contain a slash character cannot be processed.  Such files
must be renamed before they can be processed by Perl.

Older releases of VOS (prior to OpenVOS Release 17.0) limit file
names to 32 or fewer characters, prohibit file names from
starting with a C<-> character, and prohibit file names from
containing any character matching C<< tr/ !#%&'()*;<=>?// >>.

Newer releases of VOS (OpenVOS Release 17.0 or later) support a
feature known as extended names.  On these releases, file names
can contain up to 255 characters, are prohibited from starting
with a C<-> character, and the set of prohibited characters is
reduced to any character matching C<< tr/#%*<>?// >>.  There are
restrictions involving spaces and apostrophes:  these characters
must not begin or end a name, nor can they immediately precede or
follow a period.  Additionally, a space must not immediately
precede another space or hyphen.  Specifically, the following
character combinations are prohibited:  space-space,
space-hyphen, period-space, space-period, period-apostrophe,
apostrophe-period, leading or trailing space, and leading or
trailing apostrophe.  Although an extended file name is limited
to 255 characters, a path name is still limited to 256
characters.

The value of C<$^O> on VOS is "vos".  To determine the
architecture that you are running on without resorting to loading
all of C<%Config> you can examine the content of the C<@@INC> array
like so:

    if ($^O =~ /vos/) {
        print "I'm on a Stratus box!\n";
    } else {
        print "I'm not on a Stratus box!\n";
        die;
    }

=head2 EBCDIC Platforms

v5.22 core Perl runs on z/OS (formerly OS/390).  Theoretically it could
run on the successors of OS/400 on AS/400 minicomputers as well as
VM/ESA, and BS2000 for S/390 Mainframes.  Such computers use EBCDIC
character sets internally (usually
Character Code Set ID 0037 for OS/400 and either 1047 or POSIX-BC for S/390
systems).

The rest of this section may need updating, but we don't know what it
should say.  Please email comments to
L<perlbug@@perl.org|mailto:perlbug@@perl.org>.

On the mainframe Perl currently works under the "Unix system
services for OS/390" (formerly known as OpenEdition), VM/ESA OpenEdition, or
the BS200 POSIX-BC system (BS2000 is supported in Perl 5.6 and greater).
See L<perlos390> for details.  Note that for OS/400 there is also a port of
Perl 5.8.1/5.10.0 or later to the PASE which is ASCII-based (as opposed to
ILE which is EBCDIC-based), see L<perlos400>.

As of R2.5 of USS for OS/390 and Version 2.3 of VM/ESA these Unix
sub-systems do not support the C<#!> shebang trick for script invocation.
Hence, on OS/390 and VM/ESA Perl scripts can be executed with a header
similar to the following simple script:

    : # use perl
        eval 'exec /usr/local/bin/perl -S $0 ${1+"$@@"}'
            if 0;
    #!/usr/local/bin/perl     # just a comment really

    print "Hello from perl!\n";

OS/390 will support the C<#!> shebang trick in release 2.8 and beyond.
Calls to C<system> and backticks can use POSIX shell syntax on all
S/390 systems.

On the AS/400, if PERL5 is in your library list, you may need
to wrap your Perl scripts in a CL procedure to invoke them like so:

    BEGIN
      CALL PGM(PERL5/PERL) PARM('/QOpenSys/hello.pl')
    ENDPGM

This will invoke the Perl script F<hello.pl> in the root of the
QOpenSys file system.  On the AS/400 calls to C<system> or backticks
must use CL syntax.

On these platforms, bear in mind that the EBCDIC character set may have
an effect on what happens with some Perl functions (such as C<chr>,
C<pack>, C<print>, C<printf>, C<ord>, C<sort>, C<sprintf>, C<unpack>), as
well as bit-fiddling with ASCII constants using operators like C<^>, C<&>
and C<|>, not to mention dealing with socket interfaces to ASCII computers
(see L<"Newlines">).

Fortunately, most web servers for the mainframe will correctly
translate the C<\n> in the following statement to its ASCII equivalent
(C<\r> is the same under both Unix and z/OS):

    print "Content-type: text/html\r\n\r\n";

The values of C<$^O> on some of these platforms includes:

    uname         $^O        $Config{'archname'}
    --------------------------------------------
    OS/390        os390      os390
    OS400         os400      os400
    POSIX-BC      posix-bc   BS2000-posix-bc

Some simple tricks for determining if you are running on an EBCDIC
platform could include any of the following (perhaps all):

    if ("\t" eq "\005")   { print "EBCDIC may be spoken here!\n"; }

    if (ord('A') == 193) { print "EBCDIC may be spoken here!\n"; }

    if (chr(169) eq 'z') { print "EBCDIC may be spoken here!\n"; }

One thing you may not want to rely on is the EBCDIC encoding
of punctuation characters since these may differ from code page to code
page (and once your module or script is rumoured to work with EBCDIC,
folks will want it to work with all EBCDIC character sets).

=head2 Acorn RISC OS

Because Acorns use ASCII with newlines (C<\n>) in text files as C<\012> like
Unix, and because Unix filename emulation is turned on by default,
most simple scripts will probably work "out of the box".  The native
filesystem is modular, and individual filesystems are free to be
case-sensitive or insensitive, and are usually case-preserving.  Some
native filesystems have name length limits, which file and directory
names are silently truncated to fit.  Scripts should be aware that the
standard filesystem currently has a name length limit of B<10>
characters, with up to 77 items in a directory, but other filesystems
may not impose such limitations.

Native filenames are of the form

    Filesystem#Special_Field::DiskName.$.Directory.Directory.File

where

    Special_Field is not usually present, but may contain . and $ .
    Filesystem =~ m|[A-Za-z0-9_]|
    DsicName   =~ m|[A-Za-z0-9_/]|
    $ represents the root directory
    . is the path separator
    @@ is the current directory (per filesystem but machine global)
    ^ is the parent directory
    Directory and File =~ m|[^\0- "\.\$\%\&:\@@\\^\|\177]+|

The default filename translation is roughly C<tr|/.|./|;>

Note that C<"ADFS::HardDisk.$.File" ne 'ADFS::HardDisk.$.File'> and that
the second stage of C<$> interpolation in regular expressions will fall
foul of the C<$.> if scripts are not careful.

Logical paths specified by system variables containing comma-separated
search lists are also allowed; hence C<System:Modules> is a valid
filename, and the filesystem will prefix C<Modules> with each section of
C<System$Path> until a name is made that points to an object on disk.
Writing to a new file C<System:Modules> would be allowed only if
C<System$Path> contains a single item list.  The filesystem will also
expand system variables in filenames if enclosed in angle brackets, so
C<< <System$Dir>.Modules >> would look for the file
S<C<$ENV{'System$Dir'} . 'Modules'>>.  The obvious implication of this is
that B<fully qualified filenames can start with C<< <> >>> and should
be protected when C<open> is used for input.

Because C<.> was in use as a directory separator and filenames could not
be assumed to be unique after 10 characters, Acorn implemented the C
compiler to strip the trailing C<.c> C<.h> C<.s> and C<.o> suffix from
filenames specified in source code and store the respective files in
subdirectories named after the suffix.  Hence files are translated:

    foo.h           h.foo
    C:foo.h         C:h.foo        (logical path variable)
    sys/os.h        sys.h.os       (C compiler groks Unix-speak)
    10charname.c    c.10charname
    10charname.o    o.10charname
    11charname_.c   c.11charname   (assuming filesystem truncates at 10)

The Unix emulation library's translation of filenames to native assumes
that this sort of translation is required, and it allows a user-defined list
of known suffixes that it will transpose in this fashion.  This may
seem transparent, but consider that with these rules F<foo/bar/baz.h>
and F<foo/bar/h/baz> both map to F<foo.bar.h.baz>, and that C<readdir> and
C<glob> cannot and do not attempt to emulate the reverse mapping.  Other
C<.>'s in filenames are translated to C</>.

As implied above, the environment accessed through C<%ENV> is global, and
the convention is that program specific environment variables are of the
form C<Program$Name>.  Each filesystem maintains a current directory,
and the current filesystem's current directory is the B<global> current
directory.  Consequently, sociable programs don't change the current
directory but rely on full pathnames, and programs (and Makefiles) cannot
assume that they can spawn a child process which can change the current
directory without affecting its parent (and everyone else for that
matter).

Because native operating system filehandles are global and are currently
allocated down from 255, with 0 being a reserved value, the Unix emulation
library emulates Unix filehandles.  Consequently, you can't rely on
passing C<STDIN>, C<STDOUT>, or C<STDERR> to your children.

The desire of users to express filenames of the form
C<< <Foo$Dir>.Bar >> on the command line unquoted causes problems,
too: C<``> command output capture has to perform a guessing game.  It
assumes that a string C<< <[^<>]+\$[^<>]> >> is a
reference to an environment variable, whereas anything else involving
C<< < >> or C<< > >> is redirection, and generally manages to be 99%
right.  Of course, the problem remains that scripts cannot rely on any
Unix tools being available, or that any tools found have Unix-like command
line arguments.

Extensions and XS are, in theory, buildable by anyone using free
tools.  In practice, many don't, as users of the Acorn platform are
used to binary distributions.  MakeMaker does run, but no available
make currently copes with MakeMaker's makefiles; even if and when
this should be fixed, the lack of a Unix-like shell will cause
problems with makefile rules, especially lines of the form C<cd
sdbm && make all>, and anything using quoting.

"S<RISC OS>" is the proper name for the operating system, but the value
in C<$^O> is "riscos" (because we don't like shouting).

=head2 Other perls

Perl has been ported to many platforms that do not fit into any of
the categories listed above.  Some, such as AmigaOS,
QNX, Plan 9, and VOS, have been well-integrated into the standard
Perl source code kit.  You may need to see the F<ports/> directory
on CPAN for information, and possibly binaries, for the likes of:
aos, Atari ST, lynxos, riscos, Novell Netware, Tandem Guardian,
I<etc.>  (Yes, we know that some of these OSes may fall under the
Unix category, but we are not a standards body.)

Some approximate operating system names and their C<$^O> values
in the "OTHER" category include:

Following each description will be, in parentheses, a list of
platforms that the description applies to.

The list may well be incomplete, or even wrong in some places.  When

Be aware, moreover, that even among Unix-ish systems there are variations.

For many functions, you can also query C<%Config>, exported by
default from the C<Config> module.  For example, to check whether the

=item -X

C<-w> only inspects the read-only file attribute (FILE_ATTRIBUTE_READONLY),

=item alarm

Emulated using timers that must be explicitly polled whenever Perl
wants to dispatch "safe signals" and therefore cannot interrupt
blocking system calls.  (Win32)

=item atan2

Due to issues with various CPUs, math libraries, compilers, and standards,
results for C<atan2()> may vary depending on any combination of the above.
Perl attempts to conform to the Open Group/IEEE standards for the results
returned from C<atan2()>, but cannot force the issue if the system Perl is
run on does not allow it.  (Tru64, HP-UX 10.20)

The current version of the standards for C<atan2()> is available at

=item binmode

Meaningless.  (S<RISC OS>)

Reopens file and restores pointer; if function fails, underlying
filehandle may be closed, or pointer may be in a different position.
(VMS)

The value returned by C<tell> may be affected after the call, and
the filehandle may be flushed. (Win32)

=item chmod

bits are meaningless. (Win32)

Only good for changing "owner" and "other" read-write access. (S<RISC OS>)

Not supported. (Symbian OS)

=item exit

Emulates Unix C<exit()> (which considers C<exit 1> to indicate an error) by
mapping the C<1> to C<SS$_ABORT> (C<44>).  This behavior may be overridden
with the pragma C<use vmsish 'exit'>.  As with the CRTL's C<exit()>
function, C<exit 0> is also mapped to an exit status of C<SS$_NORMAL>
(C<1>); this mapping cannot be overridden.  Any other argument to
C<exit()>
is used directly as Perl's exit status.  On VMS, unless the future
POSIX_EXIT mode is enabled, the exit code should always be a valid
VMS exit code and not a generic number.  When the POSIX_EXIT mode is
enabled, a generic number will be encoded in a method compatible with
the C library _POSIX_EXIT macro so that it can be decoded by other
programs, particularly ones written in C, like the GNV package.  (VMS)

C<exit()> resets file pointers, which is a problem when called
from a child process (created by C<fork()>) in C<BEGIN>.
A workaround is to use C<POSIX::_exit>.  (Solaris)

    exit unless $Config{archname} =~ /\bsolaris\b/;

=item endprotoent

Not implemented. (Android, Win32, S<Plan 9>)

=item endservent

Not implemented. (S<Plan 9>, Win32)

=item getsockopt SOCKET,LEVEL,OPTNAME

Not implemented. (S<Plan 9>)

=item glob

This operator is implemented via the C<File::Glob> extension on most
platforms.  See L<File::Glob> for portability information.

=item gmtime

In theory, C<gmtime()> is reliable from -2**63 to 2**63-1.  However,
because work arounds in the implementation use floating point numbers,
it will become inaccurate as the time gets larger.  This is a bug and
will be fixed in the future.

On VOS, time values are 32-bit quantities.

=item ioctl FILEHANDLE,FUNCTION,SCALAR

Not implemented. (VMS)

Available only for socket handles, and it does what the C<ioctlsocket()> call
in the Winsock API does. (Win32)

Available only for socket handles. (S<RISC OS>)

=item kill

Not implemented, hence not useful for taint checking. (S<RISC OS>)

C<kill()> doesn't have the semantics of C<raise()>, i.e. it doesn't send
a signal to the identified process like it does on Unix platforms.
Instead C<kill($sig, $pid)> terminates the process identified by C<$pid>,
and makes it exit immediately with exit status $sig.  As in Unix, if
$sig is 0 and the specified process exists, it returns true without
actually terminating it. (Win32)

C<kill(-9, $pid)> will terminate the process specified by C<$pid> and
recursively all child processes owned by it.  This is different from
the Unix semantics, where the signal will be delivered to all
processes in the same process group as the process specified by
$pid. (Win32)

A pid of -1 indicating all processes on the system is not currently
supported. (VMS)

=item link

Not implemented. (S<RISC OS>, VOS)

Link count not updated because hard links are not quite that hard
(They are sort of half-way between hard and soft links). (AmigaOS)

Hard links are implemented on Win32 under NTFS only. They are
natively supported on Windows 2000 and later.  On Windows NT they
are implemented using the Windows POSIX subsystem support and the
Perl process will need Administrator or Backup Operator privileges
to create hard links.

Available on 64 bit OpenVMS 8.2 and later.  (VMS)

=item localtime

localtime() has the same range as L</gmtime>, but because time zone
rules change its accuracy for historical and future times may degrade
but usually by no more than an hour.

=item lstat

Not implemented. (S<RISC OS>)

Return values (especially for device and inode) may be bogus. (Win32)

=item msgctl

=item msgget

=item msgsnd

=item msgrcv

Not implemented. (Android, Win32, VMS, S<Plan 9>, S<RISC OS>, VOS)

=item open

open to C<|-> and C<-|> are unsupported. (Win32, S<RISC OS>)

Opening a process does not automatically flush output handles on some
platforms.  (SunOS, Solaris, HP-UX)

=item readlink

Not implemented. (Win32, VMS, S<RISC OS>)

=item rename

Can't move directories between directories on different logical volumes. (Win32)

=item rewinddir

Will not cause C<readdir()> to re-read the directory stream.  The entries
already read before the C<rewinddir()> call will just be returned again
from a cache buffer. (Win32)

=item select

Only implemented on sockets. (Win32, VMS)

Only reliable on sockets. (S<RISC OS>)

Note that the C<select FILEHANDLE> form is generally portable.

=item semctl

=item semget

=item semop

Not implemented. (Android, Win32, VMS, S<RISC OS>)

=item setgrent

Not implemented. (Android, VMS, Win32, S<RISC OS>)

=item setpgrp

Not implemented. (Win32, VMS, S<RISC OS>, VOS)

=item setpriority

=item setsockopt

=item shmctl

=item shmget

=item shmread

=item shmwrite

Not implemented. (Android, Win32, VMS, S<RISC OS>)

=item sleep

Emulated using synchronization functions such that it can be
interrupted by C<alarm()>, and limited to a maximum of 4294967 seconds,
approximately 49 days. (Win32)

=item sockatmark

A relatively recent addition to socket functions, may not
be implemented even in Unix platforms.

=item socketpair

Not implemented. (S<RISC OS>)

Available on 64 bit OpenVMS 8.2 and later.  (VMS)

=item stat

Platforms that do not have rdev, blksize, or blocks will return these
as '', so numeric comparison or manipulation of these fields may cause
'not numeric' warnings.

ctime not supported on UFS (S<Mac OS X>).

ctime is creation time instead of inode change time  (Win32).

device and inode are not meaningful.  (Win32)

device and inode are not necessarily reliable.  (VMS)

mtime, atime and ctime all return the last modification time.  Device and
inode are not necessarily reliable.  (S<RISC OS>)

dev, rdev, blksize, and blocks are not available.  inode is not
meaningful and will differ between stat calls on the same file.  (os2)

some versions of cygwin when doing a C<stat("foo")> and if not finding it
may then attempt to C<stat("foo.exe")> (Cygwin)

On Win32 C<stat()> needs to open the file to determine the link count
and update attributes that may have been changed through hard links.
Setting C<${^WIN32_SLOPPY_STAT}> to a true value speeds up C<stat()> by
not performing this operation. (Win32)

=item symlink

Not implemented. (Win32, S<RISC OS>)

Implemented on 64 bit VMS 8.3.  VMS requires the symbolic link to be in Unix
syntax if it is intended to resolve to a valid path.

=item syscall

Not implemented. (Win32, VMS, S<RISC OS>, VOS)

=item sysopen

The traditional "0", "1", and "2" MODEs are implemented with different
numeric values on some systems.  The flags exported by C<Fcntl>
(O_RDONLY, O_WRONLY, O_RDWR) should work everywhere though.  (S<Mac
OS>, OS/390)

=item system

As an optimization, may not call the command shell specified in
C<$ENV{PERL5SHELL}>.  C<system(1, @@args)> spawns an external
process and immediately returns its process designator, without
waiting for it to terminate.  Return value may be used subsequently
in C<wait> or C<waitpid>.  Failure to C<spawn()> a subprocess is indicated
by setting C<$?> to S<C<"255 << 8">>.  C<$?> is set in a way compatible with
Unix (i.e. the exitstatus of the subprocess is obtained by S<C<"$? >> 8">>,
as described in the documentation).  (Win32)

There is no shell to process metacharacters, and the native standard is
to pass a command line terminated by "\n" "\r" or "\0" to the spawned
program.  Redirection such as C<< > foo >> is performed (if at all) by
the run time library of the spawned program.  C<system> I<list> will call
the Unix emulation library's C<exec> emulation, which attempts to provide
emulation of the stdin, stdout, stderr in force in the parent, providing
the child program uses a compatible version of the emulation library.
I<scalar> will call the native command line direct and no such emulation
of a child Unix program will exists.  Mileage B<will> vary.  (S<RISC OS>)

C<system LIST> without the use of indirect object syntax (C<system PROGRAM LIST>)
may fall back to trying the shell if the first C<spawn()> fails.  (Win32)

Does not automatically flush output handles on some platforms.
(SunOS, Solaris, HP-UX)

The return value is POSIX-like (shifted up by 8 bits), which only allows
room for a made-up value derived from the severity bits of the native
32-bit condition code (unless overridden by C<use vmsish 'status'>).
If the native condition code is one that has a POSIX value encoded, the
POSIX value will be decoded to extract the expected exit value.
For more details see L<perlvms/$?>. (VMS)

=item telldir

Not implemented. (Android)

=item times

"cumulative" times will be bogus.  On anything other than Windows NT
or Windows 2000, "system" time will be bogus, and "user" time is
actually the time returned by the C<clock()> function in the C runtime
library. (Win32)

Not useful. (S<RISC OS>)

=item truncate

Not implemented. (Older versions of VMS)

Truncation to same-or-shorter lengths only. (VOS)

If a FILEHANDLE is supplied, it must be writable and opened in append
mode (i.e., use C<<< open(FH, '>>filename') >>>
or C<sysopen(FH,...,O_APPEND|O_RDWR)>.  If a filename is supplied, it
should not be held open elsewhere. (Win32)

=item umask

Returns undef where unavailable.

C<umask> works but the correct permissions are set only when the file
is finally closed. (AmigaOS)

=item utime

Only the modification time is updated. (VMS, S<RISC OS>)

May not behave as expected.  Behavior depends on the C runtime
library's implementation of C<utime()>, and the filesystem being
used.  The FAT filesystem typically does not support an "access
time" field, and it may limit timestamps to a granularity of
two seconds. (Win32)

=item wait

=item waitpid

Can only be applied to process handles returned for processes spawned
using C<system(1, ...)> or pseudo processes created with C<fork()>. (Win32)

Not useful. (S<RISC OS>)

The following platforms worked with the previous releases (5.6 and
5.7), but we did not manage either to fix or to test these in time
for the 5.8.0 release.  There is a very good chance that many of these
will work fine with the 5.8.0.

The following platforms have been known to build Perl from source in
the past (5.005_03 and earlier), but we haven't been able to verify
their status for the current release, either because the
hardware/software platforms are rare or because we don't have an
active champion on these platforms--or both.  They used to work,
though, so go ahead and try compiling them, and let perlbug@@perl.org

Perl runs on a variety of operating systems.  While most of them share
a lot in common, they also have their own very particular and unique
features.
d11 1
a11 1
Perl code, so that once you have made your decision to write portably,
d14 12
a25 11
There is a tradeoff between taking full advantage of B<a> particular type
of computer, and taking advantage of a full B<range> of them.  Naturally,
as you make your range bigger (and thus more diverse), the common
denominators drop, and you are left with fewer areas of common ground in
which you can operate to accomplish a particular task.  Thus, when you
begin attacking a problem, it is important to consider which part of the
tradeoff curve you want to operate under. Specifically, whether it is
important to you that the task that you are coding needs the full
generality of being portable, or if it is sufficient to just get the job
done.  This is the hardest choice to be made.  The rest is easy, because
Perl provides lots of choices, whichever way you want to approach your

a31 2
willfully limiting your available choices.  Naturally, it takes discipline
to do that.

Here's the general rule: When you approach a task that is commonly done

S<Mac OS>, VMS, etc.), consider writing platform-specific code.

When the code will run on only two or three operating systems, then you

traditionally uses C<\012>, one kind of Windows I/O uses C<\015\012>,
and S<Mac OS> uses C<\015>.
d89 24
a112 15
Perl uses C<\n> to represent the "logical" newline, where what
is logical may depend on the platform in use.  In MacPerl, C<\n>
always means C<\015>.  In DOSish perls, C<\n> usually means C<\012>, but
when accessing a file in "text" mode, STDIO translates it to (or from)
C<\015\012>.

Due to the "text" mode translation, DOSish perls have limitations
of using C<seek> and C<tell> when a file is being accessed in "text"
mode.  Specifically, if you stick to C<seek>-ing to locations you got
from C<tell> (and no others), you are usually free to use C<seek> and
C<tell> even in "text" mode.  In general, using C<seek> or C<tell> or
other file operations that count bytes instead of characters, without
considering the length of C<\n>, may be non-portable.  If you use
C<binmode> on a file, however, you can usually use C<seek> and C<tell>
with arbitrary values quite safely.
d114 1
a114 1
A common misconception in socket programming is that C<\n> eq C<\012>
a121 6
[NOTE: this does not necessarily apply to communications that are
filtered by another program or module before sending to the socket; the
the most popular EBCDIC webserver, for instance, accepts C<\r\n>,
which translates those characters, along with all other
characters in text streams, from EBCDIC to ASCII.]

d129 3
a131 3
When reading I<from> a socket, remember that the default input record
separator (C<$/>) is C<\n>, but code like this should recognize C<$/> as
C<\012> or C<\015\012>:
d133 1
a133 1
    while (<SOCKET>) {
d137 2
a138 1
Better:
d148 2
a149 2
And this example is actually better than the previous one even for Unix
platforms, because now any C<\015>'s (C<\cM>'s) are stripped out
d152 45
a196 7
An important thing to remember is that functions that return data
should translate newlines when appropriate.  Often one line of code
will suffice:

	$data =~ s/\015?\012/\n/g;
	return $data;

d202 24
a225 11
most common).  This affects your programs if they attempt to transfer
numbers in binary format from a CPU architecture to another over some
channel: either 'live' via network connections or storing the numbers
to secondary storage such as a disk file.

Conflicting storage orders make utter mess out of the numbers: if a
little-endian host (Intel, Alpha) stores 0x12345678 (305419896 in
decimal), a big-endian host (Motorola, MIPS, Sparc, PA) reads it as
0x78563412 (2018915346 in decimal).  To avoid this problem in network
(socket) connections use the C<pack()> and C<unpack()> formats C<"n">
and C<"N">, the "network" orders, they are guaranteed to be portable.
d227 8
a234 2
Different widths can cause truncation even between platforms of equal
endianness: the platform of shorter width loses the upper parts of the
d238 1
a238 1
One can circumnavigate both these problems in two ways: either
d240 4
a243 2
binary, or consider using modules like C<Data::Dumper> (included in
the standard distribution as of Perl 5.005) and C<Storable>.
d248 13
a260 13
So, it is reasonably safe to assume that any platform supports the
notion of a "path" to uniquely identify a file on the system.  Just
how that path is actually written, differs.

While they are similar, file path specifications differ between Unix,
Windows, S<Mac OS>, OS/2, VMS, VOS, S<RISC OS> and probably others.
Unix, for example, is one of the few OSes that has the idea of a single
root directory.

VMS, Windows, and OS/2 can work similarly to Unix with C</> as path
separator, or in their own idiosyncratic ways (such as having several

As with the newline problem above, there are modules that can help.  The
C<File::Spec> modules provide methods to do the Right Thing on whatever
platform happens to be running the program.

    use File::Spec;
    chdir(File::Spec->updir());        # go up one directory
    $file = File::Spec->catfile(
        File::Spec->curdir(), 'temp', 'file.txt'
    );
    # on Unix and Win32, './temp/file.txt'
    # on Mac OS, ':temp:file.txt'

File::Spec is available in the standard distribution, as of version
5.004_05.

In general, production code should not have file paths hardcoded; making
them user supplied or from a configuration file is better, keeping in mind
that file path syntax varies on different machines.

d425 2

Not all platforms provide for the notion of a command line, necessarily.
These are usually platforms that rely on a Graphical User Interface (GUI)
for user interaction.  So a program requiring command lines might not work
everywhere.  But this is probably for the user of the program to deal
with.

Some platforms can't delete or rename files that are being held open by
the system.  Remember to C<close> files when you are done with them.
Don't C<unlink> or C<rename> an open file.  Don't C<tie> to or C<open> a
file that is already tied to or opened; C<untie> or C<close> first.

Don't open the same file more than once at a time for writing, as some
operating systems put mandatory locks on such files.

In general, don't directly access the system in code that is meant to be
portable.  That means, no C<system>, C<exec>, C<fork>, C<pipe>, C<``>,

most platforms (though many of them do not support any type of forking),
but the problem with using them arises from what you invoke with them.
External tools are often named differently on different platforms, often
not available in the same location, often accept different arguments,
often behave differently, and often represent their results in a
platform-dependent way.  Thus you should seldom depend on them to produce
consistent results.

because that is OS-specific.  Better to store a date in an unambiguous
representation.  The ISO 8601 standard defines YYYY-MM-DD as the date
format.  A text representation (like C<1 Jan 1970>) can be easily
converted into an OS-specific value using a module like
C<Date::Parse>.  An array of values, such as those returned by
C<localtime>, can be converted to an OS-specific representation using
C<Time::Local>.

Assume very little about character sets.  Do not assume anything about
the numerical values (C<ord()>, C<chr()>) of characters.  Do not
assume that the alphabetic characters are encoded contiguously (in
numerical sense).  Do not assume anything about the ordering of the
characters.  The lowercase letters may come before or after the
uppercase letters, the lowercase and uppercase may be interlaced so
that both 'a' and 'A' come before the 'b', the accented and other
international characters may be interlaced so that E<auml> comes
before the 'b'.

If you may assume POSIX (a rather large assumption, that in practice
means UNIX), you may read more about the POSIX locale system from
L<perllocale>.  The locale system at least attempts to make things a
little bit more portable, or at least more convenient and
native-friendly for non-English users.  The system affects character
sets and encoding, and date and time formatting, among other things.

    $file = join('', <FILE>);                  # better

The last two may appear unintuitive to most people.  The first of those
two constructs repeatedly grows a string, while the second allocates a
large chunk of memory in one go.  On some systems, the latter is more
efficient that the former.

Most multi-user platforms provide basic levels of security that is usually
felt at the file-system level.  Other platforms usually don't
(unfortunately).  Thus the notion of user id, or "home" directory, or even
the state of being logged-in, may be unrecognizable on many platforms.  If
you write programs that are security conscious, it is usually best to know
what type of system you will be operating under, and write code explicitly
for that platform (or class of platforms).

    $filespec2 = 'c:\foo\bar\file.txt';
    $filespec3 = 'c:\\foo\\bar\\file.txt';

System calls accept either C</> or C<\> as the path separator.  However,
many command-line utilities of DOS vintage treat C</> as the option
prefix, so they may get confused by filenames containing C</>.  Aside
from calling any external programs, C</> will work just fine, and
probably better, as it is more consistent with popular usage, and avoids
the problem of remembering what to backwhack and what not to.

Any module requiring XS compilation is right out for most people, because
MacPerl is built using non-free (and non-cheap!) compilers.  Some XS
modules that can work with MacPerl are built and distributed in binary
form on CPAN.  See I<MacPerl: Power and Ease> and L<"CPAN Testers">
for more details.

Directories are specified as:

    volume:folder:file              for absolute pathnames
    volume:folder:                  for absolute pathnames
    :folder:file                    for relative pathnames
    :folder:                        for relative pathnames
    :file                           for relative pathnames
    file                            for relative pathnames

Files in a directory are stored in alphabetical order.  Filenames are
limited to 31 characters, and may include any character except C<:>,
which is reserved as a path separator.

Instead of C<flock>, see C<FSpSetFLock> and C<FSpRstFLock> in the
C<Mac::Files> module, or C<chmod(0444, ...)> and C<chmod(0666, ...)>.

In the MacPerl application, you can't run a program from the command line;
programs that expect C<@@ARGV> to be populated can be edited with something
like the following, which brings up a dialog box asking for the command
line arguments.
d969 1
a969 3
    if (!@@ARGV) {
        @@ARGV = split /\s+/, MacPerl::Ask('Arguments?');
    }

A MacPerl script saved as a droplet will populate C<@@ARGV> with the full
pathnames of the files dropped onto the script.
d973 2
a974 24
Mac users can use programs on a kind of command line under MPW (Macintosh
Programmer's Workshop, a free development environment from Apple).
MacPerl was first introduced as an MPW tool, and MPW can be used like a
shell:

    perl myscript.plx some arguments

ToolServer is another app from Apple that provides access to MPW tools
from MPW and the MacPerl app, which allows MacPerl programs to use
C<system>, backticks, and piped C<open>.

"S<Mac OS>" is the proper name for the operating system, but the value
in C<$^O> is "MacOS".  To determine architecture, version, or whether
the application or MPW tool version is running, check:

    $is_app    = $MacPerl::Version =~ /App/;
    $is_tool   = $MacPerl::Version =~ /MPW/;
    ($version) = $MacPerl::Version =~ /^(\S+)/;
    $is_ppc    = $MacPerl::Architecture eq 'MacPPC';
    $is_68k    = $MacPerl::Architecture eq 'Mac68K';

S<Mac OS X>, to be based on NeXT's OpenStep OS, will (in theory) be able
to run MacPerl natively, but Unix perl will also run natively under the
built-in Unix environment.

perl-in-DCL script expects to do things like C<$read = E<lt>STDINE<gt>;>.
d1025 2
a1026 28
Filenames are in the format "name.extension;version".  The maximum
length for filenames is 39 characters, and the maximum length for
extensions is also 39 characters.  Version is a number from 1 to
32767.  Valid characters are C</[A-Z0-9$_-]/>.

VMS' RMS filesystem is case insensitive and does not preserve case.
C<readdir> returns lowercased filenames, but specifying a file for
opening remains case insensitive.  Files without extensions have a
trailing period on them, so doing a C<readdir> with a file named F<A.;5>
will return F<a.> (though that file could be opened with
C<open(FH, 'A')>).

RMS had an eight level limit on directory depths from any rooted logical
(allowing 16 levels overall) prior to VMS 7.2.  Hence
C<PERL_ROOT:[LIB.2.3.4.5.6.7.8]> is a valid directory specification but
C<PERL_ROOT:[LIB.2.3.4.5.6.7.8.9]> is not.  F<Makefile.PL> authors might
have to take this into account, but at least they can refer to the former
as C</PERL_ROOT/lib/2/3/4/5/6/7/8/>.

The C<VMS::Filespec> module, which gets installed as part of the build
process on VMS, is a pure Perl module that can easily be installed on
non-VMS platforms and can be helpful for conversions to and from RMS
native formats.

What C<\n> represents depends on the type of file that is open.  It could
be C<\015>, C<\012>, C<\015\012>, or nothing.  Reading from a file
translates newlines to C<\012>, unless C<binmode> was executed on that
handle, just like DOSish perls.

contain a slash character cannot be processed.  Such files must be
renamed before they can be processed by Perl.

The following C functions are unimplemented on VOS, and any attempt by
Perl to use them will result in a fatal error message and an immediate
exit from Perl:  dup, do_aspawn, do_spawn, fork, waitpid.  Once these
functions become available in the VOS POSIX.1 implementation, you can
either recompile and rebind Perl, or you can download a newer port from
ftp.stratus.com.

Recent versions of Perl have been ported to platforms such as OS/400 on
AS/400 minicomputers as well as OS/390 & VM/ESA for IBM Mainframes.  Such
computers use EBCDIC character sets internally (usually Character Code
Set ID 00819 for OS/400 and IBM-1047 for OS/390 & VM/ESA).  Note that on

As Acorns use ASCII with newlines (C<\n>) in text files as C<\012> like
Unix and Unix filename emulation is turned on by default, it is quite
likely that most simple scripts will work "out of the box".  The native
filing system is modular, and individual filing systems are free to be

native filing systems have name length limits which file and directory
names are silently truncated to fit - scripts should be aware that the
standard disc filing system currently has a name length limit of B<10>
characters, with up to 77 items in a directory, but other filing systems

that this sort of translation is required, and allows a user defined list
of known suffixes which it will transpose in this fashion.  This may
appear transparent, but consider that with these rules C<foo/bar/baz.h>
and C<foo/bar/h/baz> both map to C<foo.bar.h.baz>, and that C<readdir> and

As implied above the environment accessed through C<%ENV> is global, and

and the current filing system's current directory is the B<global> current

directory but rely on full pathnames, and scripts (and Makefiles) cannot

Extensions and XS are, in theory, buildable by anyone using free tools.
In practice, many don't, as users of the Acorn platform are used to binary
distribution.  MakeMaker does run, but no available make currently copes
with MakeMaker's makefiles; even if/when this is fixed, the lack of a
Unix-like shell can cause problems with makefile rules, especially lines
of the form C<cd sdbm && make all>, and anything using quoting.

Perl has been ported to a variety of platforms that do not fit into any of
the above categories.  Some, such as AmigaOS, BeOS, QNX, and Plan 9, have
been well-integrated into the standard Perl source code kit.  You may need
to see the F<ports/> directory on CPAN for information, and possibly
binaries, for the likes of: aos, atari, lynxos, riscos, Tandem Guardian,
vos, I<etc.> (yes we know that some of these OSes may fall under the Unix
category, but we are not a standards body.)

Listed below are functions unimplemented or implemented differently on
various platforms.  Following each description will be, in parentheses, a
list of platforms that the description applies to.

The list may very well be incomplete, or wrong in some places.  When in
doubt, consult the platform-specific README files in the Perl source
distribution, and other documentation resources for a given port.

For many functions, you can also query C<%Config>, exported by default
from C<Config.pm>.  For example, to check if the platform has the C<lstat>
call, check C<$Config{'d_lstat'}>.  See L<Config.pm> for a full

Perl runs on numerous operating systems.  While most of them share
much in common, they also have their own unique features.
d13 1

Perl code.  That way once you make a decision to write portably,
d16 11
a26 12
There is a tradeoff between taking full advantage of one particular
type of computer and taking advantage of a full range of them.
Naturally, as you broaden your range and become more diverse, the
common factors drop, and you are left with an increasingly smaller
area of common ground in which you can operate to accomplish a
particular task.  Thus, when you begin attacking a problem, it is
important to consider under which part of the tradeoff curve you
want to operate.  Specifically, you must decide whether it is
important that the task that you are coding have the full generality
of being portable, or whether to just get the job done right now.
This is the hardest choice to be made.  The rest is easy, because
Perl provides many choices, whichever way you want to approach your
d30 2
a31 3
willfully limiting your available choices.  Naturally, it takes
discipline and sacrifice to do that.  The product of portability
and convenience may be a constant.  You have been warned.

d55 2
a56 2
Here's the general rule: When you approach a task commonly done
using a whole range of platforms, think about writing portable
d64 3
a66 3
When the code will run on only two or three operating systems, you
may need to consider only the differences of those particular systems.
The important thing is to decide where the code will run and to be

traditionally uses C<\012>, one type of DOSish I/O uses C<\015\012>,
d92 15
a106 15
Perl uses C<\n> to represent the "logical" newline, where what is
logical may depend on the platform in use.  In MacPerl, C<\n> always
means C<\015>.  In DOSish perls, C<\n> usually means C<\012>, but
when accessing a file in "text" mode, STDIO translates it to (or
from) C<\015\012>, depending on whether you're reading or writing.
Unix does the same thing on ttys in canonical mode.  C<\015\012>
is commonly referred to as CRLF.

Because of the "text" mode translation, DOSish perls have limitations
in using C<seek> and C<tell> on a file accessed in "text" mode.
Stick to C<seek>-ing to locations you got from C<tell> (and no
others), and you are usually free to use C<seek> and C<tell> even
in "text" mode.  Using C<seek> or C<tell> or other file operations
may be non-portable.  If you use C<binmode> on a file, however, you
can usually C<seek> and C<tell> with arbitrary values in safety.

such, the Socket module supplies the Right Thing for those who want it.
d129 3
a131 3
When reading from a socket, remember that the default input record
separator C<$/> is C<\n>, but robust socket code will recognize as
either C<\012> or C<\015\012> as end of line:
d137 1
a137 2
Because both CRLF and LF end in LF, the input record separator can
be set to LF and any CR stripped later.  Better to write:
d147 2
a148 2
This example is preferred over the previous one--even for Unix
platforms--because now any C<\015>'s (C<\cM>'s) are stripped out
d151 6
a156 26
Similarly, functions that return text data--such as a function that
fetches a web page--should sometimes translate newlines before
returning the data, if they've not yet been translated to the local
newline representation.  A single line of code will often suffice:

    $data =~ s/\015?\012/\n/g;
    return $data;

Some of this may be confusing.  Here's a handy reference to the ASCII CR
and LF characters.  You can print it out and stick it in your wallet.

    LF  ==  \012  ==  \x0A  ==  \cJ  ==  ASCII 10
    CR  ==  \015  ==  \x0D  ==  \cM  ==  ASCII 13

             | Unix | DOS  | Mac  |
        ---------------------------
        \n   |  LF  |  LF  |  CR  |
        \r   |  CR  |  CR  |  LF  |
        \n * |  LF  | CRLF |  CR  |
        \r * |  CR  |  CR  |  LF  |
        ---------------------------
        * text-mode STDIO

The Unix column assumes that you are not accessing a serial line
(like a tty) in canonical mode.  If you are, then CR on input becomes
"\n", and "\n" on output becomes CRLF.
a157 2
These are just the most common definitions of C<\n> and C<\r> in Perl.
There may well be others.
d163 4

most common today).  This affects your programs when they attempt to transfer
numbers in binary format from one CPU architecture to another,
usually either "live" via network connection, or by storing the
numbers to secondary storage such as a disk file or tape.
d168 2
a169 2
Conflicting storage orders make utter mess out of the numbers.  If a
little-endian host (Intel, VAX) stores 0x12345678 (305419896 in
d172 2
a173 9
(socket) connections use the C<pack> and C<unpack> formats C<n>
and C<N>, the "network" orders.  These are guaranteed to be portable.

You can explore the endianness of your platform by unpacking a
data structure packed in native format such as:

    print unpack("h*", pack("s2", 1, 2)), "\n";
    # '10002000' on e.g. Intel x86 or Alpha 21064 in little-endian mode
    # '00100020' on e.g. Motorola 68040
d175 2
a176 8
If you need to distinguish between endian architectures you could use
either of the variables set like so:

    $is_big_endian   = unpack("h*", pack("s", 1)) =~ /01/;
    $is_litte_endian = unpack("h*", pack("s", 1)) =~ /^1/;

Differing widths can cause truncation even between platforms of equal
endianness.  The platform of shorter width loses the upper parts of the
d180 1
a180 1
One can circumnavigate both these problems in two ways.  Either
d182 2
a183 3
binary, or else consider using modules like Data::Dumper (included in
the standard distribution as of Perl 5.005) and Storable.  Keeping
all data as text significantly simplifies matters.
d188 13
a200 13
So, it is reasonably safe to assume that all platforms support the
notion of a "path" to uniquely identify a file on the system.  How
that path is really written, though, differs considerably.

Atlhough similar, file path specifications differ between Unix,
Windows, S<Mac OS>, OS/2, VMS, VOS, S<RISC OS>, and probably others.
Unix, for example, is one of the few OSes that has the elegant idea
of a single root directory.

DOS, OS/2, VMS, VOS, and Windows can work similarly to Unix with C</>
as path separator, or in their own idiosyncratic ways (such as having
several root directories and various "unrooted" device files such NIL:
and LPT:).

d220 9
a228 8
If all this is intimidating, have no (well, maybe only a little)
fear.  There are modules that can help.  The File::Spec modules
provide methods to do the Right Thing on whatever platform happens
to be running the program.

    use File::Spec::Functions;
    chdir(updir());        # go up one directory
    $file = catfile(curdir(), 'temp', 'file.txt');
a230 1
    # on VMS, '[.temp]file.txt'
d232 6
a237 10
File::Spec is available in the standard distribution as of version
5.004_05.  File::Spec::Functions is only in File::Spec 0.7 and later,
and some versions of perl come with version 0.6.  If File::Spec
is not updated to 0.7 or later, you must use the object-oriented
interface from File::Spec (or upgrade File::Spec).

In general, production code should not have file paths hardcoded.
Making them user-supplied or read from a configuration file is
better, keeping in mind that file path syntax varies on different
machines.

Also of use is File::Basename from the standard distribution, which

Likewise, when using the AutoSplit module, try to keep your functions to
8.3 naming and case-insensitive conventions; or, at the least,

Whitespace in filenames is tolerated on most systems, but not all.
Many systems (DOS, VMS) cannot have more than one C<.> in their filenames.
a280 10
Don't assume C<< > >> won't be the first character of a filename.
Always use C<< < >> explicitly to open a file for reading,
unless you want the user to be able to specify a pipe open.

    open(FILE, "< $existing_file") or die $!;

If filenames might use strange characters, it is safest to open it
with C<sysopen> instead of C<open>.  C<open> is magic and can
translate characters like C<< > >>, C<< < >>, and C<|>, which may
be the wrong thing to do.  (Sometimes, though, it's the right thing.)
d284 10
a293 10
Not all platforms provide a command line.  These are usually platforms
that rely primarily on a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for user
interaction.  A program requiring a command line interface might
not work everywhere.  This is probably for the user of the program
to deal with, so don't stay up late worrying about it.

Some platforms can't delete or rename files held open by the system.
Remember to C<close> files when you are done with them.  Don't
C<unlink> or C<rename> an open file.  Don't C<tie> or C<open> a
file already tied or opened; C<untie> or C<close> it first.

Don't count on signals or C<%SIG> for anything.

In general, don't directly access the system in code meant to be
portable.  That means, no C<system>, C<exec>, C<fork>, C<pipe>,
C<``>, C<qx//>, C<open> with a C<|>, nor any of the other things
that makes being a perl hacker worth being.
d321 7
a327 8
most platforms (though many of them do not support any type of
forking).  The problem with using them arises from what you invoke
them on.  External tools are often named differently on different
platforms, may not be available in the same location, migth accept
different arguments, can behave differently, and often present their
results in a platform-dependent way.  Thus, you should seldom depend
on them to produce consistent results. (Then again, if you're calling 
I<netstat -a>, you probably don't expect it to run on both Unix and CP/M.)
d329 1

One especially common bit of Perl code is opening a pipe to B<sendmail>:

    open(MAIL, '|/usr/lib/sendmail -t') 
	or die "cannot fork sendmail: $!";
d336 4
a339 9
solution is needed, see the various distributions on CPAN that deal
with it.  Mail::Mailer and Mail::Send in the MailTools distribution are
commonly used, and provide several mailing methods, including mail,
sendmail, and direct SMTP (via Net::SMTP) if a mail transfer agent is
not available.  Mail::Sendmail is a standalone module that provides
simple, platform-independent mailing.

The Unix System V IPC (C<msg*(), sem*(), shm*()>) is not available
even on all Unix platforms.

XS code can usually be made to work with any platform, but dependent
d357 4
a360 4
A different type of portability issue arises when writing XS code:
availability of a C compiler on the end-user's system.  C brings
with it its own portability issues, and writing XS code will expose
you to some of those.  Writing purely in Perl is an easier way to

exceptions are the CPAN module (which currently makes connections to external
d369 1

ExtUtils::MM_VMS), and DBM modules.
d371 3
a373 3
There is no one DBM module available on all platforms.
SDBM_File and the others are generally available on all Unix and DOSish
ports, but not in MacPerl, where only NBDM_File and DB_File are
d377 4
a380 4
AnyDBM_File will use whichever module it can find.  Of course, then
the code needs to be fairly strict, dropping to the greatest common
factor (e.g., not exceeding 1K for each record), so that it will
work with any DBM module.  See L<AnyDBM_File> for more details.
d385 1
a385 1
widely different ways.  Don't assume the timezone is stored in C<$ENV{TZ}>,
d390 5
a394 5
because that is OS- and implementation-specific.  It is better to store a date
in an unambiguous representation.  The ISO-8601 standard defines
"YYYY-MM-DD" as the date format.  A text representation (like "1987-12-18")
can be easily converted into an OS-specific value using a module like
Date::Parse.  An array of values, such as those returned by
d396 1
a396 1
Time::Local.
a397 9
When calculating specific times, such as for tests in time or date modules,
it may be appropriate to calculate an offset for the epoch.

    require Time::Local;
    $offset = Time::Local::timegm(0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 70);

The value for C<$offset> in Unix will be C<0>, but in Mac OS will be
some large number.  C<$offset> can then be added to a Unix time value
to get what should be the proper value on any system.

Assume little about character sets.  Assume nothing about
numerical values (C<ord>, C<chr>) of characters.  Do not

that both `a' and `A' come before `b'; the accented and other

d414 7
a420 6
If you may assume POSIX (a rather large assumption), you may read
more about the POSIX locale system from L<perllocale>.  The locale
system at least attempts to make things a little bit more portable,
or at least more convenient and native-friendly for non-English
users.  The system affects character sets and encoding, and date
and time formatting--amongst other things.
d437 5

The last two constructs may appear unintuitive to most people.  The
first repeatedly grows a string, whereas the second allocates a
large chunk of memory in one go.  On some systems, the second is
more efficient that the first.

a452 8
Most multi-user platforms provide basic levels of security, usually
implemented at the filesystem level.  Some, however, do
not--unfortunately.  Thus the notion of user id, or "home" directory,
or even the state of being logged-in, may be unrecognizable on many
platforms.  If you write programs that are security-conscious, it
is usually best to know what type of system you will be running
under so that you can write code explicitly for that platform (or
class of platforms).

to other platforms easier.  Use the Config module and the special
a461 10
Be careful in the tests you supply with your module or programs.
Module code may be fully portable, but its tests might not be.  This
often happens when tests spawn off other processes or call external
programs to aid in the testing, or when (as noted above) the tests
assume certain things about the filesystem and paths.  Be careful
not to depend on a specific output style for errors, such as when
checking C<$!> after an system call.  Some platforms expect a certain
output format, and perl on those platforms may have been adjusted
accordingly.  Most specifically, don't anchor a regex when testing
an error value.

first field of the string returned by typing C<uname -a> (or a similar command)

System calls accept either C</> or C<\> as the path separator.
However, many command-line utilities of DOS vintage treat C</> as

AS/400 minicomputers as well as OS/390, VM/ESA, and BS2000 for S/390
Mainframes.  Such computers use EBCDIC character sets internally (usually
Character Code Set ID 0037 for OS/400 and either 1047 or POSIX-BC for S/390
systems).  On the mainframe perl currently works under the "Unix system
services for OS/390" (formerly known as OpenEdition), VM/ESA OpenEdition, or
the BS200 POSIX-BC system (BS2000 is supported in perl 5.6 and greater).
See L<perlos390> for details.  
a845 15
OS/390 will support the C<#!> shebang trick in release 2.8 and beyond.
Calls to C<system> and backticks can use POSIX shell syntax on all
S/390 systems.

On the AS/400, if PERL5 is in your library list, you may need
to wrap your perl scripts in a CL procedure to invoke them like so:

    BEGIN
      CALL PGM(PERL5/PERL) PARM('/QOpenSys/hello.pl')
    ENDPGM

This will invoke the perl script F<hello.pl> in the root of the
QOpenSys file system.  On the AS/400 calls to C<system> or backticks
must use CL syntax.

Because Acorns use ASCII with newlines (C<\n>) in text files as C<\012> like

most simple scripts will probably work "out of the box".  The native
filesystem is modular, and individual filesystems are free to be

a902 4
native filesystems have name length limits, which file and directory
names are silently truncated to fit.  Scripts should be aware that the

directory.  Consequently, sociable programs don't change the current
directory but rely on full pathnames, and programs (and Makefiles) cannot

Extensions and XS are, in theory, buildable by anyone using free
tools.  In practice, many don't, as users of the Acorn platform are
used to binary distributions.  MakeMaker does run, but no available
make currently copes with MakeMaker's makefiles; even if and when
this should be fixed, the lack of a Unix-like shell will cause
problems with makefile rules, especially lines of the form C<cd
sdbm && make all>, and anything using quoting.

Perl has been ported to many platforms that do not fit into any of
the categories listed above.  Some, such as AmigaOS, Atari MiNT,
BeOS, HP MPE/iX, QNX, Plan 9, and VOS, have been well-integrated
into the standard Perl source code kit.  You may need to see the
F<ports/> directory on CPAN for information, and possibly binaries,
for the likes of: aos, Atari ST, lynxos, riscos, Novell Netware,
Tandem Guardian, I<etc.>  (Yes, we know that some of these OSes may
fall under the Unix category, but we are not a standards body.)

Some approximate operating system names and their C<$^O> values
in the "OTHER" category include:

=head1 Supported Platforms

As of early March 2000 (the Perl release 5.6.0), the following
platforms are able to build Perl from the standard source code
distribution available at http://www.perl.com/CPAN/src/index.html

	AIX
	DOS DJGPP 	1)
	FreeBSD
	HP-UX
	IRIX
	Linux
	LynxOS
	MachTen
	MPE/iX
	NetBSD
	OpenBSD
	OS/2
	QNX
	Rhapsody/Darwin 2)
	SCO SV
	SINIX
	Solaris
	SVR4
	Tru64 UNIX      3)
	UNICOS
	UNICOS/mk
	Unixware
	VMS
	VOS
	Windows 3.1     1)
	Windows 95      1) 4)
	Windows 98      1) 4)
	Windows NT      1) 4)

        1) in DOS mode either the DOS or OS/2 ports can be used
        2) new in 5.6.0: the BSD/NeXT-based UNIX of Mac OS X
        3) formerly known as Digital UNIX and before that DEC OSF/1
        4) compilers: Borland, Cygwin, Mingw32 EGCS/GCC, VC++

The following platforms worked for the previous major release
(5.005_03 being the latest maintenance release of that, as of early
March 2000), but be did not manage to test these in time for the 5.6.0
release of Perl.  There is a very good chance that these will work
just fine with 5.6.0.

	A/UX
	BeOS
	BSD/OS
	DG/UX
	DYNIX/ptx
	DomainOS
	Hurd
	NextSTEP
	OpenSTEP
	PowerMAX
	SCO ODT/OSR	
	SunOS
	Ultrix

The following platform worked for the previous major release (5.005_03
being the latest maintenance release of that, as of early March 2000).
However, standardization on UTF-8 as the internal string representation
in 5.6.0 has introduced incompatibilities in this EBCDIC platform.
Support for this platform may be enabled in a future release:

	OS390	1)

	1) Previously known as MVS, or OpenEdition MVS.

Strongly related to the OS390 platform by also being EBCDIC-based
mainframe platforms are the following platforms:

	BS2000
	VM/ESA

These are also not expected to work under 5.6.0 for the same reasons
as OS390.  Contact the mailing list perl-mvs@@perl.org for more details.

MacOS (Classic, pre-X) is almost 5.6.0-ready; building from the source
does work with 5.6.0, but additional MacOS specific source code is needed
for a complete port.  Contact the mailing list macperl-porters@@macperl.org
for more information.

The following platforms have been known to build Perl from source in
the past, but we haven't been able to verify their status for the
current release, either because the hardware/software platforms are
rare or because we don't have an active champion on these
platforms--or both:

	3b1
	AmigaOS
	ConvexOS
	CX/UX
	DC/OSx
	DDE SMES
	DOS EMX
	Dynix
	EP/IX
	ESIX
	FPS
	GENIX
	Greenhills
	ISC
	MachTen 68k
	MiNT
	MPC
	NEWS-OS
	Opus
	Plan 9
	PowerUX
	RISC/os
	Stellar
	SVR2
	TI1500
	TitanOS
	Unisys Dynix
	Unixware

Support for the following platform is planned for a future Perl release:

	Netware

The following platforms have their own source code distributions and
binaries available via http://www.perl.com/CPAN/ports/index.html:

				Perl release

	AS/400			5.003
	Netware			5.003_07
	Tandem Guardian		5.004

The following platforms have only binaries available via
http://www.perl.com/CPAN/ports/index.html :

				Perl release

	Acorn RISCOS		5.005_02
	AOS			5.002
	LynxOS			5.004_02

Although we do suggest that you always build your own Perl from
the source code, both for maximal configurability and for security,
in case you are in a hurry you can check
http://www.perl.com/CPAN/ports/index.html for binary distributions.

A common cause of unportable programs is the misuse of chop() to trim
newlines:

    # XXX UNPORTABLE!
    while(<FILE>) {
        chop;
        @@array = split(/:/);
        #...
    }

You can get away with this on Unix and MacOS (they have a single
character end-of-line), but the same program will break under DOSish
perls because you're only chop()ing half the end-of-line.  Instead,
chomp() should be used to trim newlines.  The Dunce::Files module can
help audit your code for misuses of chop().

When dealing with binary files (or text files in binary mode) be sure
to explicitly set $/ to the appropriate value for your file format
before using chomp().

	   the source does work with 5.6.1, but additional MacOS specific
           source code is needed for a complete build.  Contact the mailing
           list macperl-porters@@macperl.org for more information.
        3) compilers: Borland, Cygwin, Mingw32 EGCS/GCC, VC++

The following platforms worked for the previous release (5.6.0),
but we did not manage to test these in time for the 5.6.1 release.
There is a very good chance that these will work fine with 5.6.1.

The following platform worked for the 5.005_03 major release but not
5.6.0.  Standardization on UTF-8 as the internal string representation
in 5.6.0 and 5.6.1 has introduced incompatibilities in this EBCDIC
platform.  While Perl 5.6.1 will build on this platform some
regression tests may fail and the C<use utf8;> pragma typically
introduces text handling errors.  UTF-8 support for this platform may
be enabled in a future release:

The "inode change timestamp" (the C<-C> filetest) may really be the
"creation timestamp" (which it is not in UNIX).

a269 7
Don't assume UNIX filesystem access semantics: that read, write,
and execute are all the permissions there are, and even if they exist,
that their semantics (for example what do r, w, and x mean on
a directory) are the UNIX ones.  The various UNIX/POSIX compatibility
layers usually try to make interfaces like chmod() work, but sometimes
there simply is no good mapping.

d314 5
a318 6
Do not have two files or directories of the same name with different
case, like F<test.pl> and F<Test.pl>, as many platforms have
case-insensitive (or at least case-forgiving) filenames.  Also, try
not to have non-word characters (except for C<.>) in the names, and
keep them to the 8.3 convention, for maximum portability, onerous a
burden though this may appear.
d325 1
a325 4
Whitespace in filenames is tolerated on most systems, but not all,
and even on systems where it might be tolerated, some utilities
might become confused by such whitespace.

d329 2
a330 3
Always use C<< < >> explicitly to open a file for reading, or even
better, use the three-arg version of open, unless you want the user to
be able to specify a pipe open.
d332 1
a332 1
    open(FILE, '<', $existing_file) or die $!;
a337 26
Three-arg open can also help protect against this translation in cases
where it is undesirable.

Don't use C<:> as a part of a filename since many systems use that for
their own semantics (Mac OS Classic for separating pathname components,
many networking schemes and utilities for separating the nodename and
the pathname, and so on).  For the same reasons, avoid C<@@>, C<;> and
C<|>.

Don't assume that in pathnames you can collapse two leading slashes
C<//> into one: some networking and clustering filesystems have special
semantics for that.  Let the operating system to sort it out.

The I<portable filename characters> as defined by ANSI C are

 a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r t u v w x y z
 A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R T U V W X Y Z
 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
 . _ -

and the "-" shouldn't be the first character.  If you want to be
hypercorrect, stay case-insensitive and within the 8.3 naming
convention (all the files and directories have to be unique within one
directory if their names are lowercased and truncated to eight
characters before the C<.>, if any, and to three characters after the
C<.>, if any).  (And do not use C<.>s in directory names.)
a354 19
Don't assume that write/modify permission on a directory gives the
right to add or delete files/directories in that directory.  That is
filesystem specific: in some filesystems you need write/modify
permission also (or even just) in the file/directory itself.  In some
filesystems (AFS, DFS) the permission to add/delete directory entries
is a completely separate permission.

Don't assume that a single C<unlink> completely gets rid of the file:
some filesystems (most notably the ones in VMS) have versioned
filesystems, and unlink() removes only the most recent one (it doesn't
remove all the versions because by default the native tools on those
platforms remove just the most recent version, too).  The portable
idiom to remove all the versions of a file is

    1 while unlink "file";

This will terminate if the file is undeleteable for some reason
(protected, not there, and so on).

a371 32
=head2 Command names versus file pathnames

Don't assume that the name used to invoke a command or program with
C<system> or C<exec> can also be used to test for the existence of the
file that holds the executable code for that command or program.
First, many systems have "internal" commands that are built-in to the
shell or OS and while these commands can be invoked, there is no
corresponding file.  Second, some operating systems (e.g., Cygwin,
DJGPP, OS/2, and VOS) have required suffixes for executable files;
these suffixes are generally permitted on the command name but are not
required.  Thus, a command like "perl" might exist in a file named
"perl", "perl.exe", or "perl.pm", depending on the operating system.
The variable "_exe" in the Config module holds the executable suffix,
if any.  Third, the VMS port carefully sets up $^X and
$Config{perlpath} so that no further processing is required.  This is
just as well, because the matching regular expression used below would
then have to deal with a possible trailing version number in the VMS
file name.

To convert $^X to a file pathname, taking account of the requirements
of the various operating system possibilities, say:
  use Config;
  $thisperl = $^X;
  if ($^O ne 'VMS')
     {$thisperl .= $Config{_exe} unless $thisperl =~ m/$Config{_exe}$/i;}

To convert $Config{perlpath} to a file pathname, say:
  use Config;
  $thisperl = $Config{perlpath};
  if ($^O ne 'VMS')
     {$thisperl .= $Config{_exe} unless $thisperl =~ m/$Config{_exe}$/i;}

a406 8
Do not use either the bare result of C<pack("N", 10, 20, 30, 40)> or
bare v-strings (such as C<v10.20.30.40>) to represent IPv4 addresses:
both forms just pack the four bytes into network order.  That this
would be equal to the C language C<in_addr> struct (which is what the
socket code internally uses) is not guaranteed.  To be portable use
the routines of the Socket extension, such as C<inet_aton()>,
C<inet_ntoa()>, and C<sockaddr_in()>.

d471 9
a479 14
Assume very little about character sets.

Assume nothing about numerical values (C<ord>, C<chr>) of characters.
Do not use explicit code point ranges (like \xHH-\xHH); use for
example symbolic character classes like C<[:print:]>.

Do not assume that the alphabetic characters are encoded contiguously
(in the numeric sense).  There may be gaps.

Do not assume anything about the ordering of the characters.
The lowercase letters may come before or after the uppercase letters;
the lowercase and uppercase may be interlaced so that both `a' and `A'
come before `b'; the accented and other international characters may
be interlaced so that E<auml> comes before `b'.

Don't assume the UNIX filesystem access semantics: the operating
system or the filesystem may be using some ACL systems, which are
richer languages than the usual rwx.  Even if the rwx exist,
their semantics might be different.

(From security viewpoint testing for permissions before attempting to
do something is silly anyway: if one tries this, there is potential
for race conditions-- someone or something might change the
permissions between the permissions check and the actual operation.
Just try the operation.)

Don't assume the UNIX user and group semantics: especially, don't
expect the C<< $< >> and C<< $> >> (or the C<$(> and C<$)>) to work
for switching identities (or memberships).

Don't assume set-uid and set-gid semantics. (And even if you do,
think twice: set-uid and set-gid are a known can of security worms.)

Perl is with the GNU C compiler and the generally-available version of
VOS POSIX support.  See F<README.vos> (installed as L<perlvos>) for

mapping the C<1> to SS$_ABORT (C<44>).  This behavior may be overridden
with the pragma C<use vmsish 'exit'>.  As with the CRTL's exit()

In general, do not assume the UNIX/POSIX semantics that you can shift
C<$?> right by eight to get the exit value, or that C<$? & 127>
would give you the number of the signal that terminated the program,
or that C<$? & 128> would test true if the program was terminated by a
coredump.  Instead, use the POSIX W*() interfaces: for example, use
WIFEXITED($?) and WEXITVALUE($?) to test for a normal exit and the exit
value, WIFSIGNALED($?) and WTERMSIG($?) for a signal exit and the
signal.  Core dumping is not a portable concept, so there's no portable
way to test for that.

The return value is POSIX-like (shifted up by 8 bits), which only allows
room for a made-up value derived from the severity bits of the native

There may well be others.  For example, on an EBCDIC implementation
such as z/OS (OS/390) or OS/400 (using the ILE, the PASE is ASCII-based)
the above material is similar to "Unix" but the code numbers change:
d195 2

Some platforms can't delete or rename files held open by the system,
this limitation may also apply to changing filesystem metainformation
like file permissions or owners.  Remember to C<close> files when you
are done with them.  Don't C<unlink> or C<rename> an open file.  Don't
C<tie> or C<open> a file already tied or opened; C<untie> or C<close>
it first.
d449 1

Don't count on specific values of C<$!>, neither numeric nor
especially the strings values-- users may switch their locales causing
error messages to be translated into their languages.  If you can
trust a POSIXish environment, you can portably use the symbols defined
by the Errno module, like ENOENT.  And don't trust on the values of C<$!>
at all except immediately after a failed system call.

=head2 Networking

Don't assume that you can reach the public Internet.

Don't assume that there is only one way to get through firewalls
to the public Internet.

Don't assume that you can reach outside world through any other port
than 80, or some web proxy.  ftp is blocked by many firewalls.

Don't assume that you can send email by connecting to the local SMTP port.

Don't assume that you can reach yourself or any node by the name
'localhost'.  The same goes for '127.0.0.1'.  You will have to try both.

Don't assume that the host has only one network card, or that it
can't bind to many virtual IP addresses.

Don't assume a particular network device name.

Don't assume a particular set of ioctl()s will work.

Don't assume that you can ping hosts and get replies.

Don't assume that any particular port (service) will respond.

Don't assume that Sys::Hostname() (or any other API or command)
returns either a fully qualified hostname or a non-qualified hostname:
it all depends on how the system had been configured.  Also remember
things like DHCP and NAT-- the hostname you get back might not be very
useful.

All the above "don't":s may look daunting, and they are -- but the key
is to degrade gracefully if one cannot reach the particular network
service one wants.  Croaking or hanging do not look very professional.

that variable.  Don't assume anything about the three-letter timezone
abbreviations (for example that MST would be the Mountain Standard Time,
it's been known to stand for Moscow Standard Time).  If you need to
use timezones, express them in some unambiguous format like the
exact number of minutes offset from UTC, or the POSIX timezone
format.
d570 7

because that is OS- and implementation-specific.  It is better to
store a date in an unambiguous representation.  The ISO 8601 standard
defines YYYY-MM-DD as the date format, or YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM-SS
(that's a literal "T" separating the date from the time).
Please do use the ISO 8601 instead of making us to guess what
date 02/03/04 might be.  ISO 8601 even sorts nicely as-is.
A text representation (like "1987-12-18") can be easily converted
into an OS-specific value using a module like Date::Parse.
An array of values, such as those returned by C<localtime>, can be
converted to an OS-specific representation using Time::Local.
a587 3
On Windows (at least), you shouldn't pass a negative value to C<gmtime> or
C<localtime>.

If you really want to be international, you should consider Unicode.
See L<perluniintro> and L<perlunicode> for more information.

If you want to use non-ASCII bytes (outside the bytes 0x00..0x7f) in
the "source code" of your code, to be portable you have to be explicit
about what bytes they are.  Someone might for example be using your
code under a UTF-8 locale, in which case random native bytes might be
illegal ("Malformed UTF-8 ...")  This means that for example embedding
ISO 8859-1 bytes beyond 0x7f into your strings might cause trouble
later.  If the bytes are native 8-bit bytes, you can use the C<bytes>
pragma.  If the bytes are in a string (regular expression being a
curious string), you can often also use the C<\xHH> notation instead
of embedding the bytes as-is.  If they are in some particular legacy
encoding (ether single-byte or something more complicated), you can
use the C<encoding> pragma.  (If you want to write your code in UTF-8,
you can use either the C<utf8> pragma, or the C<encoding> pragma.)
The C<bytes> and C<utf8> pragmata are available since Perl 5.6.0, and
the C<encoding> pragma since Perl 5.8.0.

assume certain things about the filesystem and paths.  Be careful not
to depend on a specific output style for errors, such as when checking
C<$!> after a failed system call.  Using C<$!> for anything else than
displaying it as output is doubtful (though see the Errno module for
testing reasonably portably for error value). Some platforms expect
a certain output format, and Perl on those platforms may have been
adjusted accordingly.  Most specifically, don't anchor a regex when
testing an error value.

To trim trailing newlines from text lines use chomp().  With default 
settings that function looks for a trailing C<\n> character and thus 
trims in a portable way.

Many systems (DOS, VMS ODS-2) cannot have more than one C<.> in their

On VMS, some entries in the %ENV hash are dynamically created when
their key is used on a read if they did not previously exist.  The
values for C<$ENV{HOME}>, C<$ENV{TERM}>, C<$ENV{HOME}>, and C<$ENV{USER}>,
are known to be dynamically generated.  The specific names that are
dynamically generated may vary with the version of the C library on VMS,
and more may exist than is documented.

On VMS by default, changes to the %ENV hash are persistent after the process
exits.  This can cause unintended issues.

of embedding the bytes as-is.  (If you want to write your code in UTF-8,
you can use the C<utf8>.) The C<bytes> and C<utf8> pragmata are
available since Perl 5.6.0.

The official name of VMS as of this writing is OpenVMS.

d1096 2
a1097 4
The VMS operating system has two filesystems, known as ODS-2 and ODS-5.

For ODS-2, filenames are in the format "name.extension;version".  The
maximum length for filenames is 39 characters, and the maximum length for
d1101 5
a1105 58
The ODS-2 filesystem is case-insensitive and does not preserve case.
Perl simulates this by converting all filenames to lowercase internally.

For ODS-5, filenames may have almost any character in them and can include
Unicode characters.  Characters that could be misinterpreted by the DCL
shell or file parsing utilities need to be prefixed with the C<^>
character, or replaced with hexadecimal characters prefixed with the
C<^> character.  Such prefixing is only needed with the pathnames are
in VMS format in applications.  Programs that can accept the UNIX format
of pathnames do not need the escape characters.  The maximum length for
filenames is 255 characters.  The ODS-5 file system can handle both
a case preserved and a case sensitive mode.

ODS-5 is only available on the OpenVMS for 64 bit platforms.

Support for the extended file specifications is being done as optional
settings to preserve backward compatibility with Perl scripts that
assume the previous VMS limitations.

In general routines on VMS that get a UNIX format file specification
should return it in a UNIX format, and when they get a VMS format
specification they should return a VMS format unless they are documented
to do a conversion.

For routines that generate return a file specification, VMS allows setting
if the C library which Perl is built on if it will be returned in VMS
format or in UNIX format.

With the ODS-2 file system, there is not much difference in syntax of
filenames without paths for VMS or UNIX.  With the extended character
set available with ODS-5 there can be a significant difference.

Because of this, existing Perl scripts written for VMS were sometimes
treating VMS and UNIX filenames interchangeably.  Without the extended
character set enabled, this behavior will mostly be maintained for
backwards compatibility.

When extended characters are enabled with ODS-5, the handling of
UNIX formatted file specifications is to that of a UNIX system.

VMS file specifications without extensions have a trailing dot.  An
equivalent UNIX file specification should not show the trailing dot.

The result of all of this, is that for VMS, for portable scripts, you
can not depend on Perl to present the filenames in lowercase, to be
case sensitive, and that the filenames could be returned in either
UNIX or VMS format.

And if a routine returns a file specification, unless it is intended to
convert it, it should return it in the same format as it found it.

C<readdir> by default has traditionally returned lowercased filenames.
When the ODS-5 support is enabled, it will return the exact case of the
filename on the disk.

Files without extensions have a trailing period on them, so doing a
C<readdir> in the default mode with a file named F<A.;5> will
return F<a.> when VMS is (though that file could be opened with
a1107 6
With support for extended file specifications and if C<opendir> was
given a UNIX format directory, a file named F<A.;5> will return F<a>
and optionally in the exact case on the disk.  When C<opendir> is given
a VMS format directory, then C<readdir> should return F<a.>, and
again with the optionally the exact case.

(allowing 16 levels overall) prior to VMS 7.2, and even with versions of
VMS on VAX up through 7.3.  Hence C<PERL_ROOT:[LIB.2.3.4.5.6.7.8]> is a
valid directory specification but C<PERL_ROOT:[LIB.2.3.4.5.6.7.8.9]> is
not.  F<Makefile.PL> authors might have to take this into account, but at
least they can refer to the former as C</PERL_ROOT/lib/2/3/4/5/6/7/8/>.

Pumpkings and module integrators can easily see whether files with too many
directory levels have snuck into the core by running the following in the
top-level source directory:

   $ perl -ne "$_=~s/\s+.*//; print if scalar(split /\//) > 8;" < MANIFEST

see if VMS is in a case sensitive mode.

The TCP/IP library support for all current versions of VMS is dynamically
loaded if present, so even if the routines are configured, they may
return a status indicating that they are not implemented.

on VMS_VAX or one of the 64 bit OpenVMS platforms.

Perl on VOS (also known as OpenVOS) is discussed in F<README.vos>
in the perl distribution (installed as L<perlvos>).  Perl on VOS
can accept either VOS- or Unix-style file specifications as in
either of the following:
d1175 9
a1183 29
delimiting character, VOS files, directories, or links whose
names contain a slash character cannot be processed.  Such files
must be renamed before they can be processed by Perl.

Older releases of VOS (prior to OpenVOS Release 17.0) limit file
names to 32 or fewer characters, prohibit file names from
starting with a C<-> character, and prohibit file names from
containing any character matching C<< tr/ !#%&'()*;<=>?// >>.

Newer releases of VOS (OpenVOS Release 17.0 or later) support a
feature known as extended names.  On these releases, file names
can contain up to 255 characters, are prohibited from starting
with a C<-> character, and the set of prohibited characters is
reduced to any character matching C<< tr/#%*<>?// >>.  There are
restrictions involving spaces and apostrophes:  these characters
must not begin or end a name, nor can they immediately precede or
follow a period.  Additionally, a space must not immediately
precede another space or hyphen.  Specifically, the following
character combinations are prohibited:  space-space,
space-hyphen, period-space, space-period, period-apostrophe,
apostrophe-period, leading or trailing space, and leading or
trailing apostrophe.  Although an extended file name is limited
to 255 characters, a path name is still limited to 256
characters.

The value of C<$^O> on VOS is "VOS".  To determine the
architecture that you are running on without resorting to loading
all of C<%Config> you can examine the content of the @@INC array
like so:
