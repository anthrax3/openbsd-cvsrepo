perlapi - autogenerated documentation for the perl public API

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This file contains the documentation of the perl public API generated by 
embed.pl, specifically a listing of functions, macros, flags, and variables 
that may be used by extension writers.  The interfaces of any functions that 
are not listed here are subject to change without notice.  For this reason,
blindly using functions listed in proto.h is to be avoided when writing
extensions.

Note that all Perl API global variables must be referenced with the C<PL_>
prefix.  Some macros are provided for compatibility with the older,
unadorned names, but this support may be disabled in a future release.

The listing is alphabetical, case insensitive.

=over 8

=item AvFILL

Same as C<av_len()>.  Deprecated, use C<av_len()> instead.

	int	AvFILL(AV* av)

=item av_clear

Clears an array, making it empty.  Does not free the memory used by the
array itself.

	void	av_clear(AV* ar)

=item av_extend

Pre-extend an array.  The C<key> is the index to which the array should be
extended.

	void	av_extend(AV* ar, I32 key)

=item av_fetch

Returns the SV at the specified index in the array.  The C<key> is the
index.  If C<lval> is set then the fetch will be part of a store.  Check
that the return value is non-null before dereferencing it to a C<SV*>.

See L<perlguts/"Understanding the Magic of Tied Hashes and Arrays"> for
more information on how to use this function on tied arrays. 

	SV**	av_fetch(AV* ar, I32 key, I32 lval)

=item av_len

Returns the highest index in the array.  Returns -1 if the array is
empty.

	I32	av_len(AV* ar)

=item av_make

Creates a new AV and populates it with a list of SVs.  The SVs are copied
into the array, so they may be freed after the call to av_make.  The new AV
will have a reference count of 1.

	AV*	av_make(I32 size, SV** svp)

=item av_pop

Pops an SV off the end of the array.  Returns C<&PL_sv_undef> if the array
is empty.

	SV*	av_pop(AV* ar)

=item av_push

Pushes an SV onto the end of the array.  The array will grow automatically
to accommodate the addition.

	void	av_push(AV* ar, SV* val)

=item av_shift

Shifts an SV off the beginning of the array.

	SV*	av_shift(AV* ar)

=item av_store

Stores an SV in an array.  The array index is specified as C<key>.  The
return value will be NULL if the operation failed or if the value did not
need to be actually stored within the array (as in the case of tied
arrays). Otherwise it can be dereferenced to get the original C<SV*>.  Note
that the caller is responsible for suitably incrementing the reference
count of C<val> before the call, and decrementing it if the function
returned NULL.

See L<perlguts/"Understanding the Magic of Tied Hashes and Arrays"> for
more information on how to use this function on tied arrays.

	SV**	av_store(AV* ar, I32 key, SV* val)

=item av_undef

Undefines the array.  Frees the memory used by the array itself.

	void	av_undef(AV* ar)

=item av_unshift

Unshift the given number of C<undef> values onto the beginning of the
array.  The array will grow automatically to accommodate the addition.  You
must then use C<av_store> to assign values to these new elements.

	void	av_unshift(AV* ar, I32 num)

=item call_argv

Performs a callback to the specified Perl sub.  See L<perlcall>.

NOTE: the perl_ form of this function is deprecated.

	I32	call_argv(const char* sub_name, I32 flags, char** argv)

=item call_method

Performs a callback to the specified Perl method.  The blessed object must
be on the stack.  See L<perlcall>.

NOTE: the perl_ form of this function is deprecated.

	I32	call_method(const char* methname, I32 flags)

=item call_pv

Performs a callback to the specified Perl sub.  See L<perlcall>.

NOTE: the perl_ form of this function is deprecated.

	I32	call_pv(const char* sub_name, I32 flags)

=item call_sv

Performs a callback to the Perl sub whose name is in the SV.  See
L<perlcall>.

NOTE: the perl_ form of this function is deprecated.

	I32	call_sv(SV* sv, I32 flags)

=item CLASS

Variable which is setup by C<xsubpp> to indicate the 
class name for a C++ XS constructor.  This is always a C<char*>.  See C<THIS>.

	char*	CLASS

=item Copy

The XSUB-writer's interface to the C C<memcpy> function.  The C<src> is the
source, C<dest> is the destination, C<nitems> is the number of items, and C<type> is
the type.  May fail on overlapping copies.  See also C<Move>.

	void	Copy(void* src, void* dest, int nitems, type)

=item croak

This is the XSUB-writer's interface to Perl's C<die> function.  Use this
function the same way you use the C C<printf> function.  See
C<warn>.

	void	croak(const char* pat, ...)

=item CvSTASH

Returns the stash of the CV.

	HV*	CvSTASH(CV* cv)

=item dMARK

Declare a stack marker variable, C<mark>, for the XSUB.  See C<MARK> and
C<dORIGMARK>.

		dMARK;

=item dORIGMARK

Saves the original stack mark for the XSUB.  See C<ORIGMARK>.

		dORIGMARK;

=item dSP

Declares a local copy of perl's stack pointer for the XSUB, available via
the C<SP> macro.  See C<SP>.

		dSP;

=item dXSARGS

Sets up stack and mark pointers for an XSUB, calling dSP and dMARK.  This
is usually handled automatically by C<xsubpp>.  Declares the C<items>
variable to indicate the number of items on the stack.

		dXSARGS;

=item dXSI32

Sets up the C<ix> variable for an XSUB which has aliases.  This is usually
handled automatically by C<xsubpp>.

		dXSI32;

=item ENTER

Opening bracket on a callback.  See C<LEAVE> and L<perlcall>.

		ENTER;

=item eval_pv

Tells Perl to C<eval> the given string and return an SV* result.

NOTE: the perl_ form of this function is deprecated.

	SV*	eval_pv(const char* p, I32 croak_on_error)

=item eval_sv

Tells Perl to C<eval> the string in the SV.

NOTE: the perl_ form of this function is deprecated.

	I32	eval_sv(SV* sv, I32 flags)

=item EXTEND

Used to extend the argument stack for an XSUB's return values. Once
used, guarrantees that there is room for at least C<nitems> to be pushed
onto the stack.

	void	EXTEND(SP, int nitems)

=item fbm_compile

Analyses the string in order to make fast searches on it using fbm_instr()
-- the Boyer-Moore algorithm.

	void	fbm_compile(SV* sv, U32 flags)

=item fbm_instr

Returns the location of the SV in the string delimited by C<str> and
C<strend>.  It returns C<Nullch> if the string can't be found.  The C<sv>
does not have to be fbm_compiled, but the search will not be as fast
then.

	char*	fbm_instr(unsigned char* big, unsigned char* bigend, SV* littlesv, U32 flags)

=item FREETMPS

Closing bracket for temporaries on a callback.  See C<SAVETMPS> and
L<perlcall>.

		FREETMPS;

=item get_av

Returns the AV of the specified Perl array.  If C<create> is set and the
Perl variable does not exist then it will be created.  If C<create> is not
set and the variable does not exist then NULL is returned.

NOTE: the perl_ form of this function is deprecated.

	AV*	get_av(const char* name, I32 create)

=item get_cv

Returns the CV of the specified Perl subroutine.  If C<create> is set and
the Perl subroutine does not exist then it will be declared (which has the
same effect as saying C<sub name;>).  If C<create> is not set and the
subroutine does not exist then NULL is returned.

NOTE: the perl_ form of this function is deprecated.

	CV*	get_cv(const char* name, I32 create)

=item get_hv

Returns the HV of the specified Perl hash.  If C<create> is set and the
Perl variable does not exist then it will be created.  If C<create> is not
set and the variable does not exist then NULL is returned.

NOTE: the perl_ form of this function is deprecated.

	HV*	get_hv(const char* name, I32 create)

=item get_sv

Returns the SV of the specified Perl scalar.  If C<create> is set and the
Perl variable does not exist then it will be created.  If C<create> is not
set and the variable does not exist then NULL is returned.

NOTE: the perl_ form of this function is deprecated.

	SV*	get_sv(const char* name, I32 create)

=item GIMME

A backward-compatible version of C<GIMME_V> which can only return
C<G_SCALAR> or C<G_ARRAY>; in a void context, it returns C<G_SCALAR>.
Deprecated.  Use C<GIMME_V> instead.

	U32	GIMME

=item GIMME_V

The XSUB-writer's equivalent to Perl's C<wantarray>.  Returns C<G_VOID>,
C<G_SCALAR> or C<G_ARRAY> for void, scalar or array context,
respectively.

	U32	GIMME_V

=item GvSV

Return the SV from the GV.

	SV*	GvSV(GV* gv)

=item gv_fetchmeth

Returns the glob with the given C<name> and a defined subroutine or
C<NULL>.  The glob lives in the given C<stash>, or in the stashes
accessible via @@ISA and @@UNIVERSAL. 

The argument C<level> should be either 0 or -1.  If C<level==0>, as a
side-effect creates a glob with the given C<name> in the given C<stash>
which in the case of success contains an alias for the subroutine, and sets
up caching info for this glob.  Similarly for all the searched stashes. 

This function grants C<"SUPER"> token as a postfix of the stash name. The
GV returned from C<gv_fetchmeth> may be a method cache entry, which is not
visible to Perl code.  So when calling C<call_sv>, you should not use
the GV directly; instead, you should use the method's CV, which can be
obtained from the GV with the C<GvCV> macro. 

	GV*	gv_fetchmeth(HV* stash, const char* name, STRLEN len, I32 level)

=item gv_fetchmethod

See L<gv_fetchmethod_autoload>.

	GV*	gv_fetchmethod(HV* stash, const char* name)

=item gv_fetchmethod_autoload

Returns the glob which contains the subroutine to call to invoke the method
on the C<stash>.  In fact in the presence of autoloading this may be the
glob for "AUTOLOAD".  In this case the corresponding variable $AUTOLOAD is
already setup. 

The third parameter of C<gv_fetchmethod_autoload> determines whether
AUTOLOAD lookup is performed if the given method is not present: non-zero
means yes, look for AUTOLOAD; zero means no, don't look for AUTOLOAD. 
Calling C<gv_fetchmethod> is equivalent to calling C<gv_fetchmethod_autoload>
with a non-zero C<autoload> parameter. 

These functions grant C<"SUPER"> token as a prefix of the method name. Note
that if you want to keep the returned glob for a long time, you need to
check for it being "AUTOLOAD", since at the later time the call may load a
different subroutine due to $AUTOLOAD changing its value. Use the glob
created via a side effect to do this. 

These functions have the same side-effects and as C<gv_fetchmeth> with
C<level==0>.  C<name> should be writable if contains C<':'> or C<'
''>. The warning against passing the GV returned by C<gv_fetchmeth> to
C<call_sv> apply equally to these functions. 

	GV*	gv_fetchmethod_autoload(HV* stash, const char* name, I32 autoload)

=item gv_stashpv

Returns a pointer to the stash for a specified package.  C<name> should
be a valid UTF-8 string.  If C<create> is set then the package will be
created if it does not already exist.  If C<create> is not set and the
package does not exist then NULL is returned.

	HV*	gv_stashpv(const char* name, I32 create)

=item gv_stashsv

Returns a pointer to the stash for a specified package, which must be a
valid UTF-8 string.  See C<gv_stashpv>.

	HV*	gv_stashsv(SV* sv, I32 create)

=item G_ARRAY

Used to indicate array context.  See C<GIMME_V>, C<GIMME> and
L<perlcall>.

=item G_DISCARD

Indicates that arguments returned from a callback should be discarded.  See
L<perlcall>.

=item G_EVAL

Used to force a Perl C<eval> wrapper around a callback.  See
L<perlcall>.

=item G_NOARGS

Indicates that no arguments are being sent to a callback.  See
L<perlcall>.

=item G_SCALAR

Used to indicate scalar context.  See C<GIMME_V>, C<GIMME>, and
L<perlcall>.

=item G_VOID

Used to indicate void context.  See C<GIMME_V> and L<perlcall>.

=item HEf_SVKEY

This flag, used in the length slot of hash entries and magic structures,
specifies the structure contains a C<SV*> pointer where a C<char*> pointer
is to be expected. (For information only--not to be used).

=item HeHASH

Returns the computed hash stored in the hash entry.

	U32	HeHASH(HE* he)

=item HeKEY

Returns the actual pointer stored in the key slot of the hash entry. The
pointer may be either C<char*> or C<SV*>, depending on the value of
C<HeKLEN()>.  Can be assigned to.  The C<HePV()> or C<HeSVKEY()> macros are
usually preferable for finding the value of a key.

	void*	HeKEY(HE* he)

=item HeKLEN

If this is negative, and amounts to C<HEf_SVKEY>, it indicates the entry
holds an C<SV*> key.  Otherwise, holds the actual length of the key.  Can
be assigned to. The C<HePV()> macro is usually preferable for finding key
lengths.

	STRLEN	HeKLEN(HE* he)

=item HePV

Returns the key slot of the hash entry as a C<char*> value, doing any
necessary dereferencing of possibly C<SV*> keys.  The length of the string
is placed in C<len> (this is a macro, so do I<not> use C<&len>).  If you do
not care about what the length of the key is, you may use the global
variable C<PL_na>, though this is rather less efficient than using a local
variable.  Remember though, that hash keys in perl are free to contain
embedded nulls, so using C<strlen()> or similar is not a good way to find
the length of hash keys. This is very similar to the C<SvPV()> macro
described elsewhere in this document.

	char*	HePV(HE* he, STRLEN len)

=item HeSVKEY

Returns the key as an C<SV*>, or C<Nullsv> if the hash entry does not
contain an C<SV*> key.

	SV*	HeSVKEY(HE* he)

=item HeSVKEY_force

Returns the key as an C<SV*>.  Will create and return a temporary mortal
C<SV*> if the hash entry contains only a C<char*> key.

	SV*	HeSVKEY_force(HE* he)

=item HeSVKEY_set

Sets the key to a given C<SV*>, taking care to set the appropriate flags to
indicate the presence of an C<SV*> key, and returns the same
C<SV*>.

	SV*	HeSVKEY_set(HE* he, SV* sv)

=item HeVAL

Returns the value slot (type C<SV*>) stored in the hash entry.

	SV*	HeVAL(HE* he)

=item HvNAME

Returns the package name of a stash.  See C<SvSTASH>, C<CvSTASH>.

	char*	HvNAME(HV* stash)

=item hv_clear

Clears a hash, making it empty.

	void	hv_clear(HV* tb)

=item hv_delete

Deletes a key/value pair in the hash.  The value SV is removed from the
hash and returned to the caller.  The C<klen> is the length of the key. 
The C<flags> value will normally be zero; if set to G_DISCARD then NULL
will be returned.

	SV*	hv_delete(HV* tb, const char* key, U32 klen, I32 flags)

=item hv_delete_ent

Deletes a key/value pair in the hash.  The value SV is removed from the
hash and returned to the caller.  The C<flags> value will normally be zero;
if set to G_DISCARD then NULL will be returned.  C<hash> can be a valid
precomputed hash value, or 0 to ask for it to be computed.

	SV*	hv_delete_ent(HV* tb, SV* key, I32 flags, U32 hash)

=item hv_exists

Returns a boolean indicating whether the specified hash key exists.  The
C<klen> is the length of the key.

	bool	hv_exists(HV* tb, const char* key, U32 klen)

=item hv_exists_ent

Returns a boolean indicating whether the specified hash key exists. C<hash>
can be a valid precomputed hash value, or 0 to ask for it to be
computed.

	bool	hv_exists_ent(HV* tb, SV* key, U32 hash)

=item hv_fetch

Returns the SV which corresponds to the specified key in the hash.  The
C<klen> is the length of the key.  If C<lval> is set then the fetch will be
part of a store.  Check that the return value is non-null before
dereferencing it to a C<SV*>. 

See L<perlguts/"Understanding the Magic of Tied Hashes and Arrays"> for more
information on how to use this function on tied hashes.

	SV**	hv_fetch(HV* tb, const char* key, U32 klen, I32 lval)

=item hv_fetch_ent

Returns the hash entry which corresponds to the specified key in the hash.
C<hash> must be a valid precomputed hash number for the given C<key>, or 0
if you want the function to compute it.  IF C<lval> is set then the fetch
will be part of a store.  Make sure the return value is non-null before
accessing it.  The return value when C<tb> is a tied hash is a pointer to a
static location, so be sure to make a copy of the structure if you need to
store it somewhere. 

See L<perlguts/"Understanding the Magic of Tied Hashes and Arrays"> for more
information on how to use this function on tied hashes.

	HE*	hv_fetch_ent(HV* tb, SV* key, I32 lval, U32 hash)

=item hv_iterinit

Prepares a starting point to traverse a hash table.  Returns the number of
keys in the hash (i.e. the same as C<HvKEYS(tb)>).  The return value is
currently only meaningful for hashes without tie magic. 

NOTE: Before version 5.004_65, C<hv_iterinit> used to return the number of
hash buckets that happen to be in use.  If you still need that esoteric
value, you can get it through the macro C<HvFILL(tb)>.

	I32	hv_iterinit(HV* tb)

=item hv_iterkey

Returns the key from the current position of the hash iterator.  See
C<hv_iterinit>.

	char*	hv_iterkey(HE* entry, I32* retlen)

=item hv_iterkeysv

Returns the key as an C<SV*> from the current position of the hash
iterator.  The return value will always be a mortal copy of the key.  Also
see C<hv_iterinit>.

	SV*	hv_iterkeysv(HE* entry)

=item hv_iternext

Returns entries from a hash iterator.  See C<hv_iterinit>.

	HE*	hv_iternext(HV* tb)

=item hv_iternextsv

Performs an C<hv_iternext>, C<hv_iterkey>, and C<hv_iterval> in one
operation.

	SV*	hv_iternextsv(HV* hv, char** key, I32* retlen)

=item hv_iterval

Returns the value from the current position of the hash iterator.  See
C<hv_iterkey>.

	SV*	hv_iterval(HV* tb, HE* entry)

=item hv_magic

Adds magic to a hash.  See C<sv_magic>.

	void	hv_magic(HV* hv, GV* gv, int how)

=item hv_store

Stores an SV in a hash.  The hash key is specified as C<key> and C<klen> is
the length of the key.  The C<hash> parameter is the precomputed hash
value; if it is zero then Perl will compute it.  The return value will be
NULL if the operation failed or if the value did not need to be actually
stored within the hash (as in the case of tied hashes).  Otherwise it can
be dereferenced to get the original C<SV*>.  Note that the caller is
responsible for suitably incrementing the reference count of C<val> before
the call, and decrementing it if the function returned NULL.  

See L<perlguts/"Understanding the Magic of Tied Hashes and Arrays"> for more
information on how to use this function on tied hashes.

	SV**	hv_store(HV* tb, const char* key, U32 klen, SV* val, U32 hash)

=item hv_store_ent

Stores C<val> in a hash.  The hash key is specified as C<key>.  The C<hash>
parameter is the precomputed hash value; if it is zero then Perl will
compute it.  The return value is the new hash entry so created.  It will be
NULL if the operation failed or if the value did not need to be actually
stored within the hash (as in the case of tied hashes).  Otherwise the
contents of the return value can be accessed using the C<He???> macros
described here.  Note that the caller is responsible for suitably
incrementing the reference count of C<val> before the call, and
decrementing it if the function returned NULL. 

See L<perlguts/"Understanding the Magic of Tied Hashes and Arrays"> for more
information on how to use this function on tied hashes.

	HE*	hv_store_ent(HV* tb, SV* key, SV* val, U32 hash)

=item hv_undef

Undefines the hash.

	void	hv_undef(HV* tb)

=item isALNUM

Returns a boolean indicating whether the C C<char> is an ascii alphanumeric
character or digit.

	bool	isALNUM(char ch)

=item isALPHA

argument will be upgraded to an RV.  That RV will be modified to point to
the new SV.  The C<classname> argument indicates the package for the
blessing.  Set C<classname> to C<Nullch> to avoid the blessing.  The new SV
will be returned and will have a reference count of 1.

=item sv_setref_pv

Copies a pointer into a new SV, optionally blessing the SV.  The C<rv>
argument will be upgraded to an RV.  That RV will be modified to point to
the new SV.  If the C<pv> argument is NULL then C<PL_sv_undef> will be placed
into the SV.  The C<classname> argument indicates the package for the
blessing.  Set C<classname> to C<Nullch> to avoid the blessing.  The new SV
will be returned and will have a reference count of 1.

Do not use with other Perl types such as HV, AV, SV, CV, because those
objects will become corrupted by the pointer copy process.

Note that C<sv_setref_pvn> copies the string while this copies the pointer.

	SV*	sv_setref_pv(SV* rv, const char* classname, void* pv)

=item sv_setref_pvn

an RV.  That RV will be modified to point to the new SV.  The C<classname>
argument indicates the package for the blessing.  Set C<classname> to
C<Nullch> to avoid the blessing.  The new SV will be returned and will have
a reference count of 1.

Note that C<sv_setref_pv> copies the pointer while this copies the string.

Like C<sv_setuv>, but also handles 'set' magic.

	void	sv_setuv_mg(SV *sv, UV u)

=item sv_unref

Unsets the RV status of the SV, and decrements the reference count of
whatever was being referenced by the RV.  This can almost be thought of
as a reversal of C<newSVrv>.  See C<SvROK_off>.

	void	sv_unref(SV* sv)

=item sv_upgrade

Upgrade an SV to a more complex form.  Use C<SvUPGRADE>.  See
C<svtype>.

	bool	sv_upgrade(SV* sv, U32 mt)

=item sv_usepvn

Tells an SV to use C<ptr> to find its string value.  Normally the string is
stored inside the SV but sv_usepvn allows the SV to use an outside string. 
The C<ptr> should point to memory that was allocated by C<malloc>.  The
string length, C<len>, must be supplied.  This function will realloc the
memory pointed to by C<ptr>, so that pointer should not be freed or used by
the programmer after giving it to sv_usepvn.  Does not handle 'set' magic.
See C<sv_usepvn_mg>.

	void	sv_usepvn(SV* sv, char* ptr, STRLEN len)

=item sv_usepvn_mg

Like C<sv_usepvn>, but also handles 'set' magic.

	void	sv_usepvn_mg(SV *sv, char *ptr, STRLEN len)

=item sv_vcatpvfn

Processes its arguments like C<vsprintf> and appends the formatted output
to an SV.  Uses an array of SVs if the C style variable argument list is
missing (NULL).  When running with taint checks enabled, indicates via
C<maybe_tainted> if results are untrustworthy (often due to the use of
locales).

	void	sv_vcatpvfn(SV* sv, const char* pat, STRLEN patlen, va_list* args, SV** svargs, I32 svmax, bool *maybe_tainted)

=item sv_vsetpvfn

Works like C<vcatpvfn> but copies the text into the SV instead of
appending it.

=item bytes_from_utf8

Converts a string C<s> of length C<len> from UTF8 into byte encoding.
Unlike <utf8_to_bytes> but like C<bytes_to_utf8>, returns a pointer to
the newly-created string, and updates C<len> to contain the new
length.  Returns the original string if no conversion occurs, C<len>
is unchanged. Do nothing if C<is_utf8> points to 0. Sets C<is_utf8> to
0 if C<s> is converted or contains all 7bit characters.

NOTE: this function is experimental and may change or be
removed without notice.

WARNING: do not use the following unless you *know* C<off> is within

on the first byte of character or just after the last byte of a character.

Return the length of the UTF-8 char encoded string C<s> in characters.
Stops at C<e> (inclusive).  If C<e E<lt> s> or if the scan would end

NOTE: this function is experimental and may change or be

	STRLEN	utf8_length(U8* s, U8 *e)

=for hackers
Found in file utf8.c

=item utf8_to_bytes

Converts a string C<s> of length C<len> from UTF8 into byte encoding.
Unlike C<bytes_to_utf8>, this over-writes the original string, and
updates len to contain the new length.
Returns zero on failure, setting C<len> to -1.

NOTE: this function is experimental and may change or be
removed without notice.

	U8*	utf8_to_bytes(U8 *s, STRLEN *len)

=for hackers
Found in file utf8.c

=item utf8_to_uv

Returns the character value of the first character in the string C<s>
which is assumed to be in UTF8 encoding and no longer than C<curlen>;
C<retlen> will be set to the length, in bytes, of that character.

If C<s> does not point to a well-formed UTF8 character, the behaviour
is dependent on the value of C<flags>: if it contains UTF8_CHECK_ONLY,
it is assumed that the caller will raise a warning, and this function
will silently just set C<retlen> to C<-1> and return zero.  If the
C<flags> does not contain UTF8_CHECK_ONLY, warnings about
malformations will be given, C<retlen> will be set to the expected
length of the UTF-8 character in bytes, and zero will be returned.

The C<flags> can also contain various flags to allow deviations from
the strict UTF-8 encoding (see F<utf8.h>).

NOTE: this function is experimental and may change or be
removed without notice.

	UV	utf8_to_uv(U8 *s, STRLEN curlen, STRLEN* retlen, U32 flags)

=for hackers
Found in file utf8.c

=item utf8_to_uv_simple

Returns the character value of the first character in the string C<s>
which is assumed to be in UTF8 encoding; C<retlen> will be set to the
length, in bytes, of that character.

If C<s> does not point to a well-formed UTF8 character, zero is
returned and retlen is set, if possible, to -1.

NOTE: this function is experimental and may change or be
removed without notice.

	UV	utf8_to_uv_simple(U8 *s, STRLEN* retlen)

=for hackers
Found in file utf8.c

=item uv_to_utf8

Adds the UTF8 representation of the Unicode codepoint C<uv> to the end
of the string C<d>; C<d> should be have at least C<UTF8_MAXLEN+1> free
bytes available. The return value is the pointer to the byte after the
end of the new character. In other words, 

    d = uv_to_utf8(d, uv);

is the recommended Unicode-aware way of saying

    *(d++) = uv;

NOTE: this function is experimental and may change or be
removed without notice.

You may call C<hv_delete> or C<hv_delete_ent> on the hash entry that the
iterator currently points to, without losing your place or invalidating your
iterator.  Note that in this case the current entry is deleted from the hash
with your iterator holding the last reference to it.  Your iterator is flagged
to free the entry on the next call to C<hv_iternext>, so you must not discard
your iterator immediately else the entry will leak - call C<hv_iternext> to
trigger the resource deallocation.

a896 20
=item hv_iternext_flags

Returns entries from a hash iterator.  See C<hv_iterinit> and C<hv_iternext>.
The C<flags> value will normally be zero; if HV_ITERNEXT_WANTPLACEHOLDERS is
set the placeholders keys (for restricted hashes) will be returned in addition
to normal keys. By default placeholders are automatically skipped over.
Currently a placeholder is implemented with a value that is literally
<&Perl_sv_undef> (a regular C<undef> value is a normal read-write SV for which
C<!SvOK> is false). Note that the implementation of placeholders and
restricted hashes may change, and the implementation currently is
insufficiently abstracted for any change to be tidy.

NOTE: this function is experimental and may change or be
removed without notice.

Creates a new SV with its SvPVX pointing to a shared string in the string
table. If the string does not already exist in the table, it is created
first.  Turns on READONLY and FAKE.  The string's hash is stored in the UV
slot of the SV; if the C<hash> parameter is non-zero, that value is used;
otherwise the hash is computed.  The idea here is that as the string table
is used for shared hash keys these strings will have SvPVX == HeKEY and
hash lookup will avoid string compare.

Return true if the strings s1 and s2 differ case-insensitively, false

the string s2 is assumed to be in UTF-8-encoded Unicode.  If u1 or u2
are false, the respective string is assumed to be in native 8-bit
encoding.

If the pe1 and pe2 are non-NULL, the scanning pointers will be copied
in there (they will point at the beginning of the I<next> character).
If the pointers behind pe1 or pe2 are non-NULL, they are the end
pointers beyond which scanning will not continue under any
circustances.  If the byte lengths l1 and l2 are non-zero, s1+l1 and
s2+l2 will be used as goal end pointers that will also stop the scan,
and which qualify towards defining a successful match: all the scans
that define an explicit length must reach their goal pointers for
a match to succeed).

For case-insensitiveness, the "casefolding" of Unicode is used
instead of upper/lowercasing both the characters, see

store that in UTF-8 in ustrp and its length in bytes in lenp.  Note
that the ustrp needs to be at least UTF8_MAXLEN_UCLC+1 bytes since the
titlecase version may be longer than the original character (up to two
characters).

The first character of the titlecased version is returned
(but note, as explained above, that there may be more.)

d3165 1
a3165 14
If C<s> does not point to a well-formed UTF8 character, the behaviour
is dependent on the value of C<flags>: if it contains UTF8_CHECK_ONLY,
it is assumed that the caller will raise a warning, and this function
will silently just set C<retlen> to C<-1> and return zero.  If the
C<flags> does not contain UTF8_CHECK_ONLY, warnings about
malformations will be given, C<retlen> will be set to the expected
length of the UTF-8 character in bytes, and zero will be returned.

The C<flags> can also contain various flags to allow deviations from
the strict UTF-8 encoding (see F<utf8.h>).

Most code should use utf8_to_uvchr() rather than call this directly.

perl_clone takes these flags as parameters:

CLONEf_COPY_STACKS - is used to, well, copy the stacks also, 
without it we only clone the data and zero the stacks, 
with it we copy the stacks and the new perl interpreter is 
ready to run at the exact same point as the previous one. 
The pseudo-fork code uses COPY_STACKS while the 
threads->new doesn't.

CLONEf_KEEP_PTR_TABLE
perl_clone keeps a ptr_table with the pointer of the old 
variable as a key and the new variable as a value, 
this allows it to check if something has been cloned and not 
clone it again but rather just use the value and increase the 
refcount. If KEEP_PTR_TABLE is not set then perl_clone will kill 
the ptr_table using the function 
C<ptr_table_free(PL_ptr_table); PL_ptr_table = NULL;>, 
reason to keep it around is if you want to dup some of your own 
variable who are outside the graph perl scans, example of this 
code is in threads.xs create

CLONEf_CLONE_HOST
This is a win32 thing, it is ignored on unix, it tells perls 
win32host code (which is c++) to clone itself, this is needed on 
win32 if you want to run two threads at the same time, 
if you just want to do some stuff in a separate perl interpreter 
and then throw it away and return to the original one, 
you don't need to do anything.

If the value is <= UV_MAX it is returned as a UV, the output flags are clear,
and nothing is written to I<*result>. If the value is > UV_MAX C<grok_oct>
returns UV_MAX, sets C<PERL_SCAN_GREATER_THAN_UV_MAX> in the output flags,

CLONEf_COPY_STACKS - is used to, well, copy the stacks also,
without it we only clone the data and zero the stacks,
with it we copy the stacks and the new perl interpreter is
ready to run at the exact same point as the previous one.
The pseudo-fork code uses COPY_STACKS while the
threads->create doesn't.

perl_clone keeps a ptr_table with the pointer of the old
variable as a key and the new variable as a value,
this allows it to check if something has been cloned and not
clone it again but rather just use the value and increase the
refcount. If KEEP_PTR_TABLE is not set then perl_clone will kill
the ptr_table using the function
C<ptr_table_free(PL_ptr_table); PL_ptr_table = NULL;>,
reason to keep it around is if you want to dup some of your own
variable who are outside the graph perl scans, example of this

This is a win32 thing, it is ignored on unix, it tells perls
win32host code (which is c++) to clone itself, this is needed on

and then throw it away and return to the original one,

Returns the CV of the specified Perl subroutine.  C<flags> are passed to
C<gv_fetchpvn_flags>. If C<GV_ADD> is set and the Perl subroutine does not
exist then it will be declared (which has the same effect as saying
C<sub name;>).  If C<GV_ADD> is not set and the subroutine does not exist
then NULL is returned.

Escapes at most the first "count" chars of pv and puts the results into
dsv such that the size of the escaped string will not exceed "max" chars
and will not contain any incomplete escape sequences.
d780 2
a781 2
If flags contains PERL_PV_ESCAPE_QUOTE then any double quotes in the string
will also be escaped.
d783 2
a784 2
Normally the SV will be cleared before the escaped string is prepared,
but when PERL_PV_ESCAPE_NOCLEAR is set this will not occur.
d786 2
a787 3
If PERL_PV_ESCAPE_UNI is set then the input string is treated as Unicode,
if PERL_PV_ESCAPE_UNI_DETECT is set then the input string is scanned
using C<is_utf8_string()> to determine if it is Unicode.
d789 1
a789 6
If PERL_PV_ESCAPE_ALL is set then all input chars will be output
using C<\x01F1> style escapes, otherwise only chars above 255 will be
escaped using this style, other non printable chars will use octal or
common escaped patterns like C<\n>. If PERL_PV_ESCAPE_NOBACKSLASH
then all chars below 255 will be treated as printable and 
will be output as literals.
d791 2
a792 6
If PERL_PV_ESCAPE_FIRSTCHAR is set then only the first char of the
string will be escaped, regardles of max. If the string is utf8 and 
the chars value is >255 then it will be returned as a plain hex 
sequence. Thus the output will either be a single char, 
an octal escape sequence, a special escape like C<\n> or a 3 or 
more digit hex value. 
a793 3
If PERL_PV_ESCAPE_RE is set then the escape char used will be a '%' and
not a '\\'. This is because regexes very often contain backslashed
sequences, whereas '%' is not a particularly common character in patterns.

           |const U32 flags

Converts a string into something presentable, handling escaping via
pv_escape() and supporting quoting and ellipses.

If the PERL_PV_PRETTY_QUOTE flag is set then the result will be 
double quoted with any double quotes in the string escaped. Otherwise
if the PERL_PV_PRETTY_LTGT flag is set then the result be wrapped in
angle brackets. 
           
If the PERL_PV_PRETTY_ELLIPSES flag is set and not all characters in
string were output then an ellipsis C<...> will be appended to the
string. Note that this happens AFTER it has been quoted.
           
If start_color is non-null then it will be inserted after the opening
quote (if there is one) but before the escaped text. If end_color
is non-null then it will be inserted after the escaped text but before
any quotes or ellipses.

Returns a pointer to the prettified text as held by dsv.

X<GvSV>

Return the SV from the GV.

	SV*	GvSV(GV* gv)

=for hackers
Found in file gv.h

=item gv_const_sv
X<gv_const_sv>

If C<gv> is a typeglob whose subroutine entry is a constant sub eligible for
inlining, or C<gv> is a placeholder reference that would be promoted to such
a typeglob, then returns the value returned by the sub.  Otherwise, returns
NULL.

	SV*	gv_const_sv(GV* gv)

=for hackers
Found in file gv.c

=item gv_fetchmeth
X<gv_fetchmeth>

Returns the glob with the given C<name> and a defined subroutine or
C<NULL>.  The glob lives in the given C<stash>, or in the stashes
accessible via @@ISA and UNIVERSAL::.

The argument C<level> should be either 0 or -1.  If C<level==0>, as a
side-effect creates a glob with the given C<name> in the given C<stash>
which in the case of success contains an alias for the subroutine, and sets
up caching info for this glob.

This function grants C<"SUPER"> token as a postfix of the stash name. The
GV returned from C<gv_fetchmeth> may be a method cache entry, which is not
visible to Perl code.  So when calling C<call_sv>, you should not use
the GV directly; instead, you should use the method's CV, which can be
obtained from the GV with the C<GvCV> macro.

	GV*	gv_fetchmeth(HV* stash, const char* name, STRLEN len, I32 level)

=for hackers
Found in file gv.c

=item gv_fetchmethod_autoload
X<gv_fetchmethod_autoload>

Returns the glob which contains the subroutine to call to invoke the method
on the C<stash>.  In fact in the presence of autoloading this may be the
glob for "AUTOLOAD".  In this case the corresponding variable $AUTOLOAD is
already setup.

The third parameter of C<gv_fetchmethod_autoload> determines whether
AUTOLOAD lookup is performed if the given method is not present: non-zero
means yes, look for AUTOLOAD; zero means no, don't look for AUTOLOAD.
Calling C<gv_fetchmethod> is equivalent to calling C<gv_fetchmethod_autoload>
with a non-zero C<autoload> parameter.

These functions grant C<"SUPER"> token as a prefix of the method name. Note
that if you want to keep the returned glob for a long time, you need to
check for it being "AUTOLOAD", since at the later time the call may load a
different subroutine due to $AUTOLOAD changing its value. Use the glob
created via a side effect to do this.

These functions have the same side-effects and as C<gv_fetchmeth> with
C<level==0>.  C<name> should be writable if contains C<':'> or C<'
''>. The warning against passing the GV returned by C<gv_fetchmeth> to
C<call_sv> apply equally to these functions.

	GV*	gv_fetchmethod_autoload(HV* stash, const char* name, I32 autoload)

=for hackers
Found in file gv.c

=item gv_fetchmeth_autoload
X<gv_fetchmeth_autoload>

Same as gv_fetchmeth(), but looks for autoloaded subroutines too.
Returns a glob for the subroutine.

For an autoloaded subroutine without a GV, will create a GV even
if C<level < 0>.  For an autoloaded subroutine without a stub, GvCV()
of the result may be zero.

=item gv_stashpvn
X<gv_stashpvn>

Returns a pointer to the stash for a specified package.  The C<namelen>
parameter indicates the length of the C<name>, in bytes.  C<flags> is passed
to C<gv_fetchpvn_flags()>, so if set to C<GV_ADD> then the package will be
created if it does not already exist.  If the package does not exist and
C<flags> is 0 (or any other setting that does not create packages) then NULL
is returned.

Ideally, all instances of C<PL_sub_generation++> in
perl source outside of C<mro.c> should be
replaced by calls to this.

Perl automatically handles most of the common
ways a method might be redefined.  However, there
are a few ways you could change a method in a stash
without the cache code noticing, in which case you
need to call this method afterwards:

1) Directly manipulating the stash HV entries from
XS code.

2) Assigning a reference to a readonly scalar
constant into a stash entry in order to create
a constant subroutine (like constant.pm
does).

This same method is available from pure perl
via, C<mro::method_changed_in(classname)>.

X<Perl_signbit>

Return a non-zero integer if the sign bit on an NV is set, and 0 if

If Configure detects this system has a signbit() that will work with
our NVs, then we just use it via the #define in perl.h.  Otherwise,
fall back on this implementation.  As a first pass, this gets everything
right except -0.0.  Alas, catching -0.0 is the main use for this function,
so this is not too helpful yet.  Still, at least we have the scaffolding
in place to support other systems, should that prove useful.


Configure notes:  This function is called 'Perl_signbit' instead of a
plain 'signbit' because it is easy to imagine a system having a signbit()
function or macro that doesn't happen to work with our particular choice
of NVs.  We shouldn't just re-#define signbit as Perl_signbit and expect
the standard system headers to be happy.  Also, this is a no-context
function (no pTHX_) because Perl_signbit() is usually re-#defined in
perl.h as a simple macro call to the system's signbit().
Users should just always call Perl_signbit().

=item get_sv
X<get_sv>

Returns the SV of the specified Perl scalar.  If C<create> is set and the
Perl variable does not exist then it will be created.  If C<create> is not
set and the variable does not exist then NULL is returned.

NOTE: the perl_ form of this function is deprecated.

Returns a pointer to the last character in the string which is in the SV.
See C<SvCUR>.  Access the character as *(SvEND(sv)).

	char*	SvEND(SV* sv)

=for hackers
Found in file sv.h

=item SvGAMAGIC
X<SvGAMAGIC>

Returns true if the SV has get magic or overloading. If either is true then
the scalar is active data, and has the potential to return a new value every
time it is accessed. Hence you must be careful to only read it once per user
logical operation and work with that returned value. If neither is true then
the scalar's value cannot change unless written to.

	char*	SvGAMAGIC(SV* sv)

=for hackers
Found in file sv.h

=item SvGROW
X<SvGROW>

Expands the character buffer in the SV so that it has room for the
indicated number of bytes (remember to reserve space for an extra trailing
NUL character).  Calls C<sv_grow> to perform the expansion if necessary.
Returns a pointer to the character buffer.

L<perlhack/PERL_MEM_LOG>).  The older API is still there for use in XS
modules supporting older perls.

Creates a new SV with its SvPVX_const pointing to a shared string in the string

value is used; otherwise the hash is computed. The string's hash can be later
be retrieved from the SV with the C<SvSHARED_HASH()> macro. The idea here is
that as the string table is used for shared hash keys these strings will have
SvPVX_const == HeKEY and hash lookup will avoid string compare.

an xpvmg; if we're a copy-on-write scalar, this is the on-write time when
we do the copy, and is also used locally. If C<SV_COW_DROP_PV> is set
then a copy-on-write scalar drops its PV buffer (if any) and becomes
SvPOK_off rather than making a copy. (Used where this scalar is about to be
set to some other value.) In addition, the C<flags> parameter gets passed to
C<sv_unref_flags()> when unrefing. C<sv_force_normal> calls this function
with flags set to 0.

Tells an SV to use C<ptr> to find its string value.  Normally the
string is stored inside the SV but sv_usepvn allows the SV to use an
outside string.  The C<ptr> should point to memory that was allocated
by C<malloc>.  The string length, C<len>, must be supplied.  By default
this function will realloc (i.e. move) the memory pointed to by C<ptr>,
so that pointer should not be freed or used by the programmer after
giving it to sv_usepvn, and neither should any pointers from "behind"
that pointer (e.g. ptr + 1) be used.

If C<flags> & SV_SMAGIC is true, will call SvSETMAGIC. If C<flags> &
SV_HAS_TRAILING_NUL is true, then C<ptr[len]> must be NUL, and the realloc
will be skipped. (i.e. the buffer is actually at least 1 byte longer than
C<len>, and already meets the requirements for storing in C<SvPVX>)
