@=head1 NAME

perlfaq - frequently asked questions about Perl

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The perlfaq comprises several documents that answer the most commonly
asked questions about Perl and Perl programming. It's divided by topic
into nine major sections outlined in this document.

=head2 Where to get the perlfaq

The perlfaq comes with the standard Perl distribution, so if you have Perl
you should have the perlfaq. You should also have the C<perldoc> tool
that lets you read the L<perlfaq>:

	$ perldoc perlfaq

Besides your local system, you can find the perlfaq on the web, including
at http://perldoc.perl.org/ .

The perlfaq is an evolving document and you can read the latest version
at http://faq.perl.org/ . The perlfaq-workers periodically post extracts
of the latest perlfaq to comp.lang.perl.misc.

You can view the source tree at https://github.com/briandfoy/perlfaq
(which is outside of the main Perl source tree). The git repository
notes all changes to the FAQ and holds the latest version of the
working documents and may vary significantly from the version
distributed with the latest version of Perl. Check the repository
before sending your corrections.

=head2 How to contribute to the perlfaq

You can mail corrections, additions, and suggestions to
C<< <perlfaq-workers AT perl DOT org> >>. The perlfaq volunteers use this
address to coordinate their efforts and track the perlfaq development.
They appreciate your contributions to the FAQ but do not have time to
provide individual help, so don't use this address to ask FAQs.

The perlfaq server posts extracts of the perlfaq to that newsgroup every
6 hours (or so), and the community of volunteers reviews and updates the
answers. If you'd like to help review and update the answers, check out
comp.lang.perl.misc.

You can also fork the git repository for the perlfaq and send a pull
request so the main repository can pull your changes. The repository
is at:

       https://github.com/briandfoy/perlfaq

=head2 What will happen if you mail your Perl programming problems to the authors?

The perlfaq-workers like to keep all traffic on the perlfaq-workers list
so that everyone can see the work being done (and the work that needs to
be done). The mailing list serves as an official record. If you email the
authors or maintainers directly, you'll probably get a reply asking you
to post to the mailing list. If you don't get a reply, it probably means
that the person never saw the message or didn't have time to deal with
it. Posting to the list allows the volunteers with time to deal with it
when others are busy.

If you have a question that isn't in the FAQ and you would like help with
it, try the resources in L<perlfaq2>.

=head1 CREDITS

Tom Christiansen wrote the original perlfaq then expanded it with the
help of Nat Torkington. The perlfaq-workers maintain current document
and the dezinens of comp.lang.perl.misc regularly review and update the
FAQ. Several people have contributed answers, corrections, and comments,
and the perlfaq notes those contributions wherever appropriate.

individual perlfaq documents for additional copyright information.

=head2 L<perlfaq8>: System Interaction

This section of the Perl FAQ covers questions involving operating system interaction. Topics include interprocess communication (IPC), control over the user-interface (keyboard, screen and pointing devices), and most anything else not related to data manipulation. Read the FAQs and documentation specific to the port of perl to your operating system (eg, L<perlvms>, L<perlplan9>, ...). These should contain more detailed information on the vagaries of your perl.

=head2 What will happen if you mail your Perl programming problems to the authors

Your questions will probably go unread, unless they're
suggestions of new questions to add to the FAQ, in which
case they should have gone to the perlfaq-workers@@perl.org
instead.

You should have read section 2 of this faq.  There you would
have learned that comp.lang.perl.misc is the appropriate
place to go for free advice.  If your question is really
important and you require a prompt and correct answer, you
should hire a consultant.

=head1 Credits

The original perlfaq was written by Tom Christiansen, then expanded
by collaboration between Tom and Nathan Torkington.  The current
document is maintained by the perlfaq-workers (perlfaq-workers@@perl.org).
Several people have contributed answers, corrections, and comments.

This document is posted regularly to comp.lang.perl.announce and
several other related newsgroups.  It is available on many
web sites: http://www.perldoc.com/ and http://perlfaq.cpan.org/ .

=head2 How to contribute to the perlfaq

You may mail corrections, additions, and suggestions to
perlfaq-workers@@perl.org .  This alias should not be 
used to I<ask> FAQs.  It's for fixing the current FAQ.
Send questions to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup.

=head1 Credits

When I first began the Perl FAQ in the late 80s, I never realized it
would have grown to over a hundred pages, nor that Perl would ever become
so popular and widespread.  This document could not have been written
without the tremendous help provided by Larry Wall and the rest of the
Perl Porters.

The perlfaq is divided into several documents based on topics.  A table

=head2 Where to get the perlfaq

Extracts of the perlfaq are posted regularly to
comp.lang.perl.misc.  It is available on many web sites:
http://www.perldoc.com/ and http://faq.perl.org/

=head2 How to contribute to the perlfaq

You may mail corrections, additions, and suggestions to
perlfaq-workers@@perl.org .  This alias should not be used to
I<ask> FAQs.  It's for fixing the current FAQ. Send
questions to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup.  You can
view the source tree at http://cvs.perl.org/cvsweb/perlfaq/
(which is outside of the main Perl source tree).  The CVS
repository notes all changes to the FAQ.

=head2 What will happen if you mail your Perl programming problems to the authors

Your questions will probably go unread, unless they're
suggestions of new questions to add to the FAQ, in which
case they should have gone to the perlfaq-workers@@perl.org
instead.

You should have read section 2 of this faq.  There you would
have learned that comp.lang.perl.misc is the appropriate
place to go for free advice.  If your question is really
important and you require a prompt and correct answer, you
should hire a consultant.

=head1 Credits

The original perlfaq was written by Tom Christiansen, then expanded
by collaboration between Tom and Nathan Torkington.  The current
document is maintained by the perlfaq-workers (perlfaq-workers@@perl.org).
Several people have contributed answers, corrections, and comments.

This section of the Perl FAQ covers questions involving operating system interaction.

Read the FAQs and documentation specific to the port of perl to your operating system (eg, L<perlvms>, L<perlplan9>, ...). These should contain more detailed information on the vagaries of your perl.

perlfaq - frequently asked questions about Perl
d7 2
a8 3
The perlfaq comprises several documents that answer the most commonly
asked questions about Perl and Perl programming. It's divided by topic
into nine major sections outlined in this document.
d12 3
a14 19
The perlfaq comes with the standard Perl distribution, so if you have Perl
you should have the perlfaq. You should also have the C<perldoc> tool
that let's you read the L<perlfaq>:

	$ perldoc perlfaq

Besides your local system, you can find the perlfaq on the web, including
at http://perldoc.perl.org/ .

The perlfaq is an evolving document and you can read the latest version
at http://faq.perl.org/ . The perlfaq-workers periodically post extracts
of the latest perlfaq to comp.lang.perl.misc.

You can view the source tree at
http://cvs.perl.org/viewcvs/cvs-public/perlfaq/ (which is outside of the
main Perl source tree).  The CVS repository notes all changes to the FAQ
and holds the latest version of the working documents and may vary
significantly from the version distributed with the latest version of
Perl. Check the repository before sending your corrections.
d18 52
a69 42
You can mail corrections, additions, and suggestions to 
C<< <perlfaq-workers AT perl DOT org> >>. The perlfaq volunteers use this
address to coordinate their efforts and track the perlfaq development.
They appreciate your contributions to the FAQ but do not have time to
provide individual help, so don't use this address to ask FAQs.

The perlfaq server posts extracts of the perlfaq to that newsgroup every
6 hours (or so), and the community of volunteers reviews and updates the
answers. If you'd like to help review and update the answers, check out
comp.lang.perl.misc.

=head2 What will happen if you mail your Perl programming problems to the authors?

The perlfaq-workers like to keep all traffic on the perlfaq-workers list
so that everyone can see the work being done (and the work that needs to
be done). The mailing list serves as an official record. If you email the
authors or maintainers directly, you'll probably get a reply asking you
to post to the mailing list. If you don't get a reply, it probably means
that the person never saw the message or didn't have time to deal with
it. Posting to the list allows the volunteers with time to deal with it
when others are busy.

If you have a question that isn't in the FAQ and you would like help with
it, try the resources in L<perlfaq2>.

=head1 CREDITS

Tom Christiansen wrote the original perlfaq then expanded it with the
help of Nat Torkington.  The perlfaq-workers maintain current document
and the dezinens of comp.lang.perl.misc regularly review and update the

This section is surprisingly small because the rest of the FAQ is littered with answers involving regular expressions. For example, decoding a URL and checking whether something is a number are handled with regular expressions, but those answers are found elsewhere in this document (in L<perlfaq9>: "How do I decode or create those %-encodings on the web" and L<perlfaq4>: "How do I determine whether a scalar is a number/whole/integer/float", to be precise).
