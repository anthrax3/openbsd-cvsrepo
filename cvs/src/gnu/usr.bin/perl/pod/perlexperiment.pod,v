perlexperiment - A listing of experimental features in Perl

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document lists the current and past experimental features in the perl
core. Although all of these are documented with their appropriate topics,
this succinct listing gives you an overview and basic facts about their
status.

So far we've merely tried to find and list the experimental features and infer
their inception, versions, etc. There's a lot of speculation here.

=head2 Current experiments

=over 8

=item C<our> can now have an experimental optional attribute C<unique>

Introduced in Perl 5.8.0

Deprecated in Perl 5.10.0

The ticket for this feature is
L<[perl #119313]|https://rt.perl.org/rt3/Ticket/Display.html?id=119313>.

=item Smart match (C<~~>)

L<[perl #119451]|https://rt.perl.org/rt3/Ticket/Display.html?id=119451>.

See also: L<perlrecharclass/Extended Bracketed Character Classes>

Introduced in Perl 5.20.0

Using this feature triggers warnings in the category
C<experimental::signatures>.

The ticket for this feature is
L<[perl #121481]|https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=121481>.

=item Aliasing via reference

Introduced in Perl 5.22.0

See also: L<perlsub/Constant Functions>

=item use re 'strict';

Introduced in Perl 5.22.0

Using this feature triggers warnings in the category
C<experimental::re_strict>.

See L<re/'strict' mode>

=item String- and number-specific bitwise operators

Introduced in Perl 5.22.0

See also: L<perlop/Bitwise String Operators>

Using this feature triggers warnings in the category
C<experimental::bitwise>.

=item Unicode in Perl on EBCDIC

=back

=head2 Accepted features

These features were so wildly successful and played so well with others that
we decided to remove their experimental status and admit them as full, stable
features in the world of Perl, lavishing all the benefits and luxuries thereof.
They are also awarded +5 Stability and +3 Charisma.

=over 8

=item 64-bit support

Introduced in Perl 5.005

=item die accepts a reference
