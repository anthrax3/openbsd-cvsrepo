@mv Makefile.SH Makefile.SHs

Everything is updated to perl5.002b1d.

I added a generally useful ;-) code to Makefile.SH to have dependencies
on makedepend, installman and installperl (makedepend is the tricky one!).

I did update MANIFEST with _all_ the added diff.* files, I hope
some files will be just applied, thus not needed for MANIFEST. Well, the 
patch for MANIFEST is in os2/diff.MANIFEST ;-).

diff.init is just a suggestion to move system-specific code into headers.

I think that 

diff.Makefile 
diff.installperl 
diff.installman 
diff.x2pMakefile
diff.mkdep

are ready for prime time, though big ;-(. 
It is up to you what to do with them (They use long names like EXE_EXT now).

diff.c2ph, diff.rest are small and should not break anything.

diff.db_file adds binary mode.
