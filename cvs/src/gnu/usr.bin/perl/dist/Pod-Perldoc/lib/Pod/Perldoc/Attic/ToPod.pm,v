# This class is just a hack to act as a "formatter" for

# 
# Note that this isn't the same as just passing thru whatever
# we're given -- we pass thru only the pod source, and suppress
# the Perl code (or whatever non-pod stuff is in the source file).

=head1 NAME

Pod::Perldoc::ToPod - let Perldoc render Pod as ... Pod!

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  perldoc -opod Some::Modulename

(That's currently the same as the following:)

  perldoc -u Some::Modulename

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a "plug-in" class that allows Perldoc to display Pod source as
itself!  Pretty Zen, huh?

Currently this class works by just filtering out the non-Pod stuff from
a given input file.

=head1 SEE ALSO

L<Pod::Perldoc>
