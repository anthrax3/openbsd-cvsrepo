=head1 NAME

Pod::Perldoc::ToRtf - let Perldoc render Pod as RTF

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  perldoc -o rtf Some::Modulename

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a "plug-in" class that allows Perldoc to use
Pod::Simple::RTF as a formatter class.

This is actually a Pod::Simple::RTF subclass, and inherits
all its options.

You have to have Pod::Simple::RTF installed (from the Pod::Simple dist),
or this module won't work.

If Perldoc is running under MSWin and uses this class as a formatter,
the output will be opened with F<write.exe> or whatever program is
specified in the environment variable C<RTFREADER>. For example, to
specify that RTF files should be opened the same as they are when you
double-click them, you would do C<set RTFREADER=start.exe> in your
F<autoexec.bat>.

Handy tip: put C<set PERLDOC=-ortf> in your F<autoexec.bat>
and that will set this class as the default formatter to run when
you do C<perldoc whatever>.
