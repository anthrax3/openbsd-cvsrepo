=head1 NAME

File::Spec::Unix - File::Spec for Unix, base for other File::Spec modules

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 require File::Spec::Unix; # Done automatically by File::Spec

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Methods for manipulating file specifications.  Other File::Spec
modules, such as File::Spec::Mac, inherit from File::Spec::Unix and
override specific methods.

=head1 METHODS

=over 2

=item canonpath()

No physical check on the filesystem, but a logical cleanup of a
path. On UNIX eliminates successive slashes and successive "/.".

    $cpath = File::Spec->canonpath( $path ) ;

Note that this does *not* collapse F<x/../y> sections into F<y>.  This
is by design.  If F</foo> on your system is a symlink to F</bar/baz>,
then F</foo/../quux> is actually F</bar/quux>, not F</quux> as a naive
F<../>-removal would give you.  If you want to do this kind of
processing, you probably want C<Cwd>'s C<realpath()> function to
actually traverse the filesystem cleaning up paths like this.

=cut

=item catdir()

Concatenate two or more directory names to form a complete path ending
with a directory. But remove the trailing slash from the resulting
string, because it doesn't look good, isn't necessary and confuses
OS2. Of course, if this is the root directory, don't cut off the
trailing slash :-)

=item curdir

Returns a string representation of the current directory.  "." on UNIX.

=cut

sub curdir { '.' }
use constant _fn_curdir => ".";

=item devnull

Returns a string representation of the null device. "/dev/null" on UNIX.

=cut

=item rootdir

Returns a string representation of the root directory.  "/" on UNIX.

=cut

sub rootdir { '/' }

=item tmpdir

Returns a string representation of the first writable directory from
the following list or the current directory if none from the list are
writable:

    $ENV{TMPDIR}
    /tmp

If running under taint mode, and if $ENV{TMPDIR}
is tainted, it is not used.

=item updir

Returns a string representation of the parent directory.  ".." on UNIX.

=cut

sub updir { '..' }
use constant _fn_updir => "..";

=item no_upwards

Given a list of file names, strip out those that refer to a parent
directory. (Does not strip symlinks, only '.', '..', and equivalents.)

=cut

sub no_upwards {
    my $self = shift;
    return grep(!/^\.{1,2}\z/s, @@_);
}

=item case_tolerant

Returns a true or false value indicating, respectively, that alphabetic
is not or is significant when comparing file specifications.

=cut

sub case_tolerant { 0 }
use constant _fn_case_tolerant => 0;

=item file_name_is_absolute

Takes as argument a path and returns true if it is an absolute path.

This does not consult the local filesystem on Unix, Win32, OS/2 or Mac 
OS (Classic).  It does consult the working environment for VMS (see
L<File::Spec::VMS/file_name_is_absolute>).

=cut

sub file_name_is_absolute {
    my ($self,$file) = @@_;
    return scalar($file =~ m:^/:s);
}

=item path

Takes no argument, returns the environment variable PATH as an array.

=cut

sub path {
    return () unless exists $ENV{PATH};
    my @@path = split(':', $ENV{PATH});
    foreach (@@path) { $_ = '.' if $_ eq '' }
    return @@path;
}

=item join

join is the same as catfile.

=cut

sub join {
    my $self = shift;
    return $self->catfile(@@_);
}

=item splitpath

    ($volume,$directories,$file) = File::Spec->splitpath( $path );
    ($volume,$directories,$file) = File::Spec->splitpath( $path,
                                                          $no_file );

Splits a path into volume, directory, and filename portions. On systems
with no concept of volume, returns '' for volume. 

For systems with no syntax differentiating filenames from directories, 
assumes that the last file is a path unless $no_file is true or a 
trailing separator or /. or /.. is present. On Unix this means that $no_file
true makes this return ( '', $path, '' ).

The directory portion may or may not be returned with a trailing '/'.

The results can be passed to L</catpath()> to get back a path equivalent to
(usually identical to) the original path.

=cut

sub splitpath {
    my ($self,$path, $nofile) = @@_;

    my ($volume,$directory,$file) = ('','','');

    if ( $nofile ) {
        $directory = $path;
    }
    else {
        $path =~ m|^ ( (?: .* / (?: \.\.?\z )? )? ) ([^/]*) |xs;
        $directory = $1;
        $file      = $2;
    }

    return ($volume,$directory,$file);
}


=item splitdir

The opposite of L</catdir()>.

    @@dirs = File::Spec->splitdir( $directories );

$directories must be only the directory portion of the path on systems 
that have the concept of a volume or that have path syntax that differentiates
files from directories.

Unlike just splitting the directories on the separator, empty
directory names (C<''>) can be returned, because these are significant
on some OSs.

On Unix,

    File::Spec->splitdir( "/a/b//c/" );

Yields:

    ( '', 'a', 'b', '', 'c', '' )

=cut

sub splitdir {
    return split m|/|, $_[1], -1;  # Preserve trailing fields
}


=item catpath()

Takes volume, directory and file portions and returns an entire path. Under
Unix, $volume is ignored, and directory and file are concatenated.  A '/' is
inserted if needed (though if the directory portion doesn't start with
'/' it is not added).  On other OSs, $volume is significant.

=cut

sub catpath {
    my ($self,$volume,$directory,$file) = @@_;

    if ( $directory ne ''                && 
         $file ne ''                     && 
         substr( $directory, -1 ) ne '/' && 
         substr( $file, 0, 1 ) ne '/' 
    ) {
        $directory .= "/$file" ;
    }
    else {
        $directory .= $file ;
    }

    return $directory ;
}

=item abs2rel

Takes a destination path and an optional base path returns a relative path
from the base path to the destination path:

    $rel_path = File::Spec->abs2rel( $path ) ;
    $rel_path = File::Spec->abs2rel( $path, $base ) ;

If $base is not present or '', then L<cwd()|Cwd> is used. If $base is
relative, then it is converted to absolute form using
L</rel2abs()>. This means that it is taken to be relative to
L<cwd()|Cwd>.

On systems that have a grammar that indicates filenames, this ignores the 
$base filename. Otherwise all path components are assumed to be
directories.

If $path is relative, it is converted to absolute form using L</rel2abs()>.
This means that it is taken to be relative to L<cwd()|Cwd>.

No checks against the filesystem are made, so the result may not be correct if
C<$base> contains symbolic links.  (Apply
L<Cwd::abs_path()|Cwd/abs_path> beforehand if that
is a concern.)  On VMS, there is interaction with the working environment, as
logicals and macros are expanded.

Based on code written by Shigio Yamaguchi.

=cut

=item rel2abs()

Converts a relative path to an absolute path. 

    $abs_path = File::Spec->rel2abs( $path ) ;
    $abs_path = File::Spec->rel2abs( $path, $base ) ;

If $base is not present or '', then L<cwd()|Cwd> is used. If $base is
relative, then it is converted to absolute form using
L</rel2abs()>. This means that it is taken to be relative to
L<cwd()|Cwd>.

On systems that have a grammar that indicates filenames, this ignores
the $base filename. Otherwise all path components are assumed to be
directories.

If $path is absolute, it is cleaned up and returned using L</canonpath()>.

No checks against the filesystem are made.  On VMS, there is
interaction with the working environment, as logicals and
macros are expanded.

@Patch perl CVE-2016-1238

The problem relates to Perl 5 ("perl") loading modules from the
includes directory array ("@@INC") in which the last element is the
current directory (".").  That means that, when "perl" wants to
load a module (during first compilation or during lazy loading of
a module in run-time), perl will look for the module in the current
directory at the end, since '.' is the last include directory in
its array of include directories to seek. The issue is with requiring
libraries that are in "." but are not otherwise installed.

The major problem with this behavior is that it unexpectedly puts
a user at risk whenever they execute any Perl scripts from a directory
that is writable by other accounts on the system. For instance, if
a user is logged in as root and changes directory into /tmp or an
account's home directory, it is possible to now run any shell
commands that are written in C, Python or Ruby without fear.

The same isn't true for any shell commands that are written in Perl,
since a significant proportion of Perl scripts will execute code
in the current working directory whenever they are run. For example,
if a user on a shared system creates the file /tmp/Pod/Perldoc/Toterm.pm,
and then I log in as root, change directory to /tmp, and run "perldoc
perlrun", it will execute the code they have placed in the file.

log
@Patch perl CVE-2016-1238

The problem relates to Perl 5 ("perl") loading modules from the
includes directory array ("@@INC") in which the last element is the
current directory (".").  That means that, when "perl" wants to
load a module (during first compilation or during lazy loading of
a module in run-time), perl will look for the module in the current
directory at the end, since '.' is the last include directory in
its array of include directories to seek. The issue is with requiring
libraries that are in "." but are not otherwise installed.

The major problem with this behavior is that it unexpectedly puts
a user at risk whenever they execute any Perl scripts from a directory
that is writable by other accounts on the system. For instance, if
a user is logged in as root and changes directory into /tmp or an
account's home directory, it is possible to now run any shell
commands that are written in C, Python or Ruby without fear.

The same isn't true for any shell commands that are written in Perl,
since a significant proportion of Perl scripts will execute code
in the current working directory whenever they are run. For example,
if a user on a shared system creates the file /tmp/Pod/Perldoc/Toterm.pm,
and then I log in as root, change directory to /tmp, and run "perldoc
perlrun", it will execute the code they have placed in the file.
