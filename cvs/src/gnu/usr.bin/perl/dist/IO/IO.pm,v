=head1 NAME

IO - load various IO modules

=head1 SYNOPSIS

   use IO qw(Handle File); # loads IO modules, here IO::Handle, IO::File
   use IO;                 # DEPRECATED

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<IO> provides a simple mechanism to load several of the IO modules
in one go.  The IO modules belonging to the core are:

      IO::Handle
      IO::Seekable
      IO::File
      IO::Pipe
      IO::Socket
      IO::Dir
      IO::Select
      IO::Poll

Some other IO modules don't belong to the perl core but can be loaded
as well if they have been installed from CPAN.  You can discover which
ones exist by searching for "^IO::" on http://search.cpan.org.

For more information on any of these modules, please see its respective
documentation.

=head1 DEPRECATED

    use IO;                # loads all the modules listed below

The loaded modules are IO::Handle, IO::Seekable, IO::File, IO::Pipe,
IO::Socket, IO::Dir.  You should instead explicitly import the IO
modules you want.

@Patch perl CVE-2016-1238

The problem relates to Perl 5 ("perl") loading modules from the
includes directory array ("@@INC") in which the last element is the
current directory (".").  That means that, when "perl" wants to
load a module (during first compilation or during lazy loading of
a module in run-time), perl will look for the module in the current
directory at the end, since '.' is the last include directory in
its array of include directories to seek. The issue is with requiring
libraries that are in "." but are not otherwise installed.

The major problem with this behavior is that it unexpectedly puts
a user at risk whenever they execute any Perl scripts from a directory
that is writable by other accounts on the system. For instance, if
a user is logged in as root and changes directory into /tmp or an
account's home directory, it is possible to now run any shell
commands that are written in C, Python or Ruby without fear.

The same isn't true for any shell commands that are written in Perl,
since a significant proportion of Perl scripts will execute code
in the current working directory whenever they are run. For example,
if a user on a shared system creates the file /tmp/Pod/Perldoc/Toterm.pm,
and then I log in as root, change directory to /tmp, and run "perldoc
perlrun", it will execute the code they have placed in the file.
