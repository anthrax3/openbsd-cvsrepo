=head1 NAME 

IO::Dir - supply object methods for directory handles

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use IO::Dir;
    $d = IO::Dir->new(".");
    if (defined $d) {
        while (defined($_ = $d->read)) { something($_); }
        $d->rewind;
        while (defined($_ = $d->read)) { something_else($_); }
        undef $d;
    }

    tie %dir, 'IO::Dir', ".";
    foreach (keys %dir) {
	print $_, " " , $dir{$_}->size,"\n";
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The C<IO::Dir> package provides two interfaces to perl's directory reading
routines.

The first interface is an object approach. C<IO::Dir> provides an object
constructor and methods, which are just wrappers around perl's built in
directory reading routines.

=over 4

=item new ( [ DIRNAME ] )

C<new> is the constructor for C<IO::Dir> objects. It accepts one optional
argument which,  if given, C<new> will pass to C<open>

=back

The following methods are wrappers for the directory related functions built
into perl (the trailing 'dir' has been removed from the names). See L<perlfunc>
for details of these functions.

=over 4

=item open ( DIRNAME )

=item read ()

=item seek ( POS )

=item tell ()

=item rewind ()

=item close ()

=back

C<IO::Dir> also provides an interface to reading directories via a tied
hash. The tied hash extends the interface beyond just the directory
reading routines by the use of C<lstat>, from the C<File::stat> package,
C<unlink>, C<rmdir> and C<utime>.

=over 4

=item tie %hash, 'IO::Dir', DIRNAME [, OPTIONS ]

=back

The keys of the hash will be the names of the entries in the directory. 
Reading a value from the hash will be the result of calling
C<File::stat::lstat>.  Deleting an element from the hash will 
delete the corresponding file or subdirectory,
provided that C<DIR_UNLINK> is included in the C<OPTIONS>.

Assigning to an entry in the hash will cause the time stamps of the file
to be modified. If the file does not exist then it will be created. Assigning
a single integer to a hash element will cause both the access and 
modification times to be changed to that value. Alternatively a reference to
an array of two values can be passed. The first array element will be used to
set the access time and the second element will be used to set the modification
time.

1.2
log
@Patch perl CVE-2016-1238

The problem relates to Perl 5 ("perl") loading modules from the
includes directory array ("@@INC") in which the last element is the
current directory (".").  That means that, when "perl" wants to
load a module (during first compilation or during lazy loading of
a module in run-time), perl will look for the module in the current
directory at the end, since '.' is the last include directory in
its array of include directories to seek. The issue is with requiring
libraries that are in "." but are not otherwise installed.

The major problem with this behavior is that it unexpectedly puts
a user at risk whenever they execute any Perl scripts from a directory
that is writable by other accounts on the system. For instance, if
a user is logged in as root and changes directory into /tmp or an
account's home directory, it is possible to now run any shell
commands that are written in C, Python or Ruby without fear.

The same isn't true for any shell commands that are written in Perl,
since a significant proportion of Perl scripts will execute code
in the current working directory whenever they are run. For example,
if a user on a shared system creates the file /tmp/Pod/Perldoc/Toterm.pm,
and then I log in as root, change directory to /tmp, and run "perldoc
perlrun", it will execute the code they have placed in the file.
