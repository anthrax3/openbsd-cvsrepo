package IO::Seekable;

=head1 NAME

IO::Seekable - supply seek based methods for I/O objects

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use IO::Seekable;
    package IO::Something;
    @@ISA = qw(IO::Seekable);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<IO::Seekable> does not have a constructor of its own as it is intended to
be inherited by other C<IO::Handle> based objects. It provides methods
which allow seeking of the file descriptors.

=over 4

=item $io->getpos

Returns an opaque value that represents the current position of the
IO::File, or C<undef> if this is not possible (eg an unseekable stream such
as a terminal, pipe or socket). If the fgetpos() function is available in
your C library it is used to implements getpos, else perl emulates getpos
using C's ftell() function.

=item $io->setpos

Uses the value of a previous getpos call to return to a previously visited
position. Returns "0 but true" on success, C<undef> on failure.

=back

See L<perlfunc> for complete descriptions of each of the following
supported C<IO::Seekable> methods, which are just front ends for the
corresponding built-in functions:

=over 4

=item $io->seek ( POS, WHENCE )

Seek the IO::File to position POS, relative to WHENCE:

=over 8

=item WHENCE=0 (SEEK_SET)

POS is absolute position. (Seek relative to the start of the file)

=item WHENCE=1 (SEEK_CUR)

POS is an offset from the current position. (Seek relative to current)

=item WHENCE=2 (SEEK_END)

POS is an offset from the end of the file. (Seek relative to end)

=back

The SEEK_* constants can be imported from the C<Fcntl> module if you
don't wish to use the numbers C<0> C<1> or C<2> in your code.

Returns C<1> upon success, C<0> otherwise.

=item $io->sysseek( POS, WHENCE )

Similar to $io->seek, but sets the IO::File's position using the system
call lseek(2) directly, so will confuse most perl IO operators except
sysread and syswrite (see L<perlfunc> for full details)

Returns the new position, or C<undef> on failure.  A position
of zero is returned as the string C<"0 but true">

=item $io->tell

Returns the IO::File's current position, or -1 on error.

=back

@Patch perl CVE-2016-1238

The problem relates to Perl 5 ("perl") loading modules from the
includes directory array ("@@INC") in which the last element is the
current directory (".").  That means that, when "perl" wants to
load a module (during first compilation or during lazy loading of
a module in run-time), perl will look for the module in the current
directory at the end, since '.' is the last include directory in
its array of include directories to seek. The issue is with requiring
libraries that are in "." but are not otherwise installed.

The major problem with this behavior is that it unexpectedly puts
a user at risk whenever they execute any Perl scripts from a directory
that is writable by other accounts on the system. For instance, if
a user is logged in as root and changes directory into /tmp or an
account's home directory, it is possible to now run any shell
commands that are written in C, Python or Ruby without fear.

The same isn't true for any shell commands that are written in Perl,
since a significant proportion of Perl scripts will execute code
in the current working directory whenever they are run. For example,
if a user on a shared system creates the file /tmp/Pod/Perldoc/Toterm.pm,
and then I log in as root, change directory to /tmp, and run "perldoc
perlrun", it will execute the code they have placed in the file.

@Revert version bumps on perl modules

These shouldn't have been bumped with the CVE-2016-1238 change and
cause problems with IO::Socket::IP.
