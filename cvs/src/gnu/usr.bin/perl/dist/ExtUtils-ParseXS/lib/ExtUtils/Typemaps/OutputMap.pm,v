=head1 NAME

ExtUtils::Typemaps::OutputMap - Entry in the OUTPUT section of a typemap

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use ExtUtils::Typemaps;
  ...
  my $output = $typemap->get_output_map('T_NV');
  my $code = $output->code();
  $output->code("...");

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Refer to L<ExtUtils::Typemaps> for details.

=head1 METHODS

=cut

=head2 new

Requires C<xstype> and C<code> parameters.

=cut

sub new {
  my $prot = shift;
  my $class = ref($prot)||$prot;
  my %args = @@_;

  if (!ref($prot)) {
    if (not defined $args{xstype} or not defined $args{code}) {
      die("Need xstype and code parameters");
    }
  }

  my $self = bless(
    (ref($prot) ? {%$prot} : {})
    => $class
  );

  $self->{xstype} = $args{xstype} if defined $args{xstype};
  $self->{code} = $args{code} if defined $args{code};
  $self->{code} =~ s/^(?=\S)/\t/mg;

  return $self;
}

=head2 code

Returns or sets the OUTPUT mapping code for this entry.

=cut

sub code {
  $_[0]->{code} = $_[1] if @@_ > 1;
  return $_[0]->{code};
}

=head2 xstype

Returns the name of the XS type of the OUTPUT map.

=cut

sub xstype {
  return $_[0]->{xstype};
}

=head2 cleaned_code

Returns a cleaned-up copy of the code to which certain transformations
have been applied to make it more ANSI compliant.

=cut

sub cleaned_code {
  my $self = shift;
  my $code = $self->code;

  # Move C pre-processor instructions to column 1 to be strictly ANSI
  # conformant. Some pre-processors are fussy about this.
  $code =~ s/^\s+#/#/mg;
  $code =~ s/\s*\z/\n/;

  return $code;
}

=head2 targetable

This is an obscure but effective optimization that used to
live in C<ExtUtils::ParseXS> directly. Not implementing it
should never result in incorrect use of typemaps, just less
efficient code.

In a nutshell, this will check whether the output code
involves calling C<sv_setiv>, C<sv_setuv>, C<sv_setnv>, C<sv_setpv> or
C<sv_setpvn> to set the special C<$arg> placeholder to a new value
B<AT THE END OF THE OUTPUT CODE>. If that is the case, the code is
eligible for using the C<TARG>-related macros to optimize this.
Thus the name of the method: C<targetable>.

If this optimization is applicable, C<ExtUtils::ParseXS> will
emit a C<dXSTARG;> definition at the start of the generated XSUB code,
and type (see below) dependent code to set C<TARG> and push it on
the stack at the end of the generated XSUB code.

If the optimization can not be applied, this returns undef.
If it can be applied, this method returns a hash reference containing
the following information:

  type:      Any of the characters i, u, n, p
  with_size: Bool indicating whether this is the sv_setpvn variant
  what:      The code that actually evaluates to the output scalar
  what_size: If "with_size", this has the string length (as code,
             not constant, including leading comma)

=cut

sub targetable {
  my $self = shift;
  return $self->{targetable} if exists $self->{targetable};

  our $bal; # ()-balanced
  $bal = qr[
    (?:
      (?>[^()]+)

    )?
  ]x;

  my $size = qr[ # Third arg (to setpvn)
    , \s* (??{ $bal })
  ]xo;

  my $code = $self->code;

  # We can still bootstrap compile 're', because in code re.pm is
  # available to miniperl, and does not attempt to load the XS code.
  use re 'eval';

  my ($type, $with_size, $arg, $sarg) =
    ($code =~
      m[^
        \s+
        sv_set([iunp])v(n)?    # Type, is_setpvn
        \s*
        \( \s*

          ( $size )?           # Possible sizeof set-from
        \s* \) \s* ; \s* $
      ]xo
  );

@Patch perl CVE-2016-1238

The problem relates to Perl 5 ("perl") loading modules from the
includes directory array ("@@INC") in which the last element is the
current directory (".").  That means that, when "perl" wants to
load a module (during first compilation or during lazy loading of
a module in run-time), perl will look for the module in the current
directory at the end, since '.' is the last include directory in
its array of include directories to seek. The issue is with requiring
libraries that are in "." but are not otherwise installed.

The major problem with this behavior is that it unexpectedly puts
a user at risk whenever they execute any Perl scripts from a directory
that is writable by other accounts on the system. For instance, if
a user is logged in as root and changes directory into /tmp or an
account's home directory, it is possible to now run any shell
commands that are written in C, Python or Ruby without fear.

The same isn't true for any shell commands that are written in Perl,
since a significant proportion of Perl scripts will execute code
in the current working directory whenever they are run. For example,
if a user on a shared system creates the file /tmp/Pod/Perldoc/Toterm.pm,
and then I log in as root, change directory to /tmp, and run "perldoc
perlrun", it will execute the code they have placed in the file.
