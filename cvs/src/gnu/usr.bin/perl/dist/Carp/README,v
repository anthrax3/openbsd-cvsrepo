Carp - alternative warn and die for modules

DESCRIPTION

The Carp routines are useful in your own modules because they act like
die() or warn(), but with a message which is more likely to be useful
to a user of your module.  In the case of cluck, confess, and longmess
that context is a summary of every call in the call-stack.  For a shorter
message you can use carp or croak which report the error as being from
where your module was called.  There is no guarantee that that is where
the error was, but it is a good educated guess.

You can also alter the way the output and logic of Carp works, by changing
some global variables in the Carp namespace.

INSTALLATION

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

AUTHOR

The Carp module first appeared in Larry Wall's perl 5.000 distribution.
Since then it has been modified by several of the perl 5 porters.
Andrew Main (Zefram) <zefram@@fysh.org> divested Carp into an independent
distribution.
