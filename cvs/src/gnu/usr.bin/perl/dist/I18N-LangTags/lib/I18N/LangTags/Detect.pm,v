@Patch perl CVE-2016-1238

The problem relates to Perl 5 ("perl") loading modules from the
includes directory array ("@@INC") in which the last element is the
current directory (".").  That means that, when "perl" wants to
load a module (during first compilation or during lazy loading of
a module in run-time), perl will look for the module in the current
directory at the end, since '.' is the last include directory in
its array of include directories to seek. The issue is with requiring
libraries that are in "." but are not otherwise installed.

The major problem with this behavior is that it unexpectedly puts
a user at risk whenever they execute any Perl scripts from a directory
that is writable by other accounts on the system. For instance, if
a user is logged in as root and changes directory into /tmp or an
account's home directory, it is possible to now run any shell
commands that are written in C, Python or Ruby without fear.

The same isn't true for any shell commands that are written in Perl,
since a significant proportion of Perl scripts will execute code
in the current working directory whenever they are run. For example,
if a user on a shared system creates the file /tmp/Pod/Perldoc/Toterm.pm,
and then I log in as root, change directory to /tmp, and run "perldoc
perlrun", it will execute the code they have placed in the file.

=head1 NAME

I18N::LangTags::Detect - detect the user's language preferences

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use I18N::LangTags::Detect;
  my @@user_wants = I18N::LangTags::Detect::detect();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

It is a common problem to want to detect what language(s) the user would
prefer output in.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

This module defines one public function,
C<I18N::LangTags::Detect::detect()>.  This function is not exported
(nor is even exportable), and it takes no parameters.

In scalar context, the function returns the most preferred language
tag (or undef if no preference was seen).

In list context (which is usually what you want),
the function returns a
(possibly empty) list of language tags representing (best first) what
languages the user apparently would accept output in.  You will
probably want to pass the output of this through
C<I18N::LangTags::implicate_supers_tightly(...)>
or
C<I18N::LangTags::implicate_supers(...)>, like so:

  my @@languages =
    I18N::LangTags::implicate_supers_tightly(
      I18N::LangTags::Detect::detect()
    );


=head1 ENVIRONMENT

This module looks for several environment variables, including
REQUEST_METHOD, HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE,
LANGUAGE, LC_ALL, LC_MESSAGES, and LANG.

It will also use the L<Win32::Locale> module, if it's installed.


=head1 SEE ALSO

L<I18N::LangTags>, L<Win32::Locale>, L<Locale::Maketext>.

(This module's core code started out as a routine in Locale::Maketext;
but I moved it here once I realized it was more generally useful.)
