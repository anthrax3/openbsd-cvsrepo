Perl 5 README file for the EPOC operating system.
=====================================================================

Olaf Flebbe <o.flebbe@@gmx.de>
http://www.linuxstart.com/~oflebbe/perl/perl5.html
2000-02-20

=====================================================================
Introduction
=====================================================================

EPOC is a OS for palmtops and mobile phones. For more informations look at:
http://www.symbian.com/

This is a port of Perl version 5.5.650 to EPOC. It runs on the Perl
Series 5, Series 5mx and the Psion Revo. I have no reports for other
EPOC devices.

Features are left out, because of restrictions of the POSIX support.

=====================================================================
Installation/Usage
=====================================================================

You will need ~4MB free space in order to install and run perl.

Install perl.sis on the EPOC machine (most likely a PSION Series 5,
5mx). If you do not know how to do that, you are on your own. 

Perl itself and its standard library are using 2.5 MB disk space. I
left out unicode support modules and modules which will not work with
this version. (For details look into epoc/createpkg.pl). If you like
to use them, you are free to copy them from a current perl release.

Copy eshell.exe from the same page you got perl to your EPOC device.
Start eshell.exe with a double tap.

Now you can enter: perl -de 0 in order to run the perl debugger. If
you are leaving perl, you get into the system screen. You have to
switch back manually to eshell.exe When perl is running, you will see
a task with the name STDOUT in the task list.

======================================================================
IO Redirection
======================================================================

You can redirect the output with the UNIX bourne shell syntax (this is
built into perl rather then eshell) For instance the following command
line will run the script test.pl with the output redirected to
stdout_file, the errors to stderr_file and input from stdin_file.

perl test.pl >stdout_file <stdin_file 2>stderr_file

Alternativly you can use 2>&1 in order to add the standard error
output to stdout.

======================================================================
PATH Names
======================================================================

Pathnames to executables in eshell.exe have to be written with
backslashes '\', file arguments to perl with slashes '/'. The default
drive of perl is the same as the drive perl.exe is located on, the
default path seems to be '/'.

i.e. command lines look a little bit funny:

D:\perl.exe C:/test.pl >C:/output.txt

You can automatically search for file on all EPOC drives with a ? as
the driver letter. For instance ?:\a.txt seraches for C:\a.txt,
D:\b.txt (and Z:\a.txt).

======================================================================
Editors
======================================================================

You may have a problem to create perl scripts. A cumbersome workaround
is to use the OPL Editor and exporting to text.

The OPL+ Editor is quite good. (Shareware: http://www.twiddlebit.com)
There is a port of vim around: 
        http://www.starship.freeserve.co.uk/index.html

======================================================================
Restrictions
======================================================================

The following things are left out of this perl port:

+ backquoting, pipes etc.

+ system() does not inherit ressources like: file descriptors,
  environment etc.

+ signal, kill, alarm. Do not try to use them. This may be
  impossible to implement on EPOC.

+ select is missing.

+ binmode does not exist. (No CR LF to LF translation for text files)

+ EPOC does not handle the notion of current drive and current
  directory very well (i.e. not at all, but it tries hard to emulate
  one) See PATH.

+ You need the shell eshell.exe in order to run perl.exe and supply
  it with arguments.

+ Heap is limited to 4MB.

===================================================================
Compiling Perl 5 on the EPOC cross compiling envionment.
===================================================================

Sorry, this is far too short.

    You will need the C++ SDK from http://developer.epocworld.com/. 

    You will need to set up the cross SDK from 
    http://www.linuxstart.com/~oflebbe

    You may have to adjust config.sh (cc, cppflags) for your epoc 
    install location.

    You may have to adjust config.sh for your cross SDK location

    Get the Perl sources from your nearest CPAN site.

    Unpack the sources. 

      Build a native perl from this sources... 
      cp epoc/* .
      ./Configure -S
      make perl
      cp miniperl.native miniperl
      make perl
      perl link.pl perlmain.o lib/auto/DynaLoader/DynaLoader.a \
         lib/auto/Data/Dumper.a \
         lib/auto/File/Glob/Glob.a lib/auto/IO/IO.a \
         lib/auto/Socket/Socket.a perl.a `cat ext.libs`
      perl createpkg.pl 
      wine "G:/bin/makesis perl.pkg perl.sis"


====================================================================
Wish List
====================================================================

- Threads ?
- Acess to the GUI?

====================================================================
Support Status
====================================================================

I'm offering this port "as is".  You can ask me questions, but I can't
guarantee I'll be able to answer them; I don't know much about Perl
internals myself;

=head1 NAME

README.epoc - Perl for EPOC

=head1 SYNOPSIS

d3 1
d5 7
a11 1
=head1 INTRODUCTION
d16 3
a18 20
This is a port of perl to EPOC. It runs on ER5 machines: Psion 5mx,
5mx Pro, Psion Revo and on the Ericson M128. I have no report about
the Psion Netbook or the S7. It runs on ER3 Hardware (Series 5
classic), too. For more information about this hardware please refer
to http://www.psion.com.

Vendors which like to have support for their devices are free to send
me a sample. 

=head1 INSTALLING PERL ON EPOC

You can download a ready-to-install version from
http://www.science-computing.de/o.flebbe/perl. You may find other
versions with some CPAN modules included at this location.

You will need at least 4MB free space in order to install and run
perl.

Install perl.sis on the EPOC machine. If you do not know how to do
that, consult your PsiWin documentation.
d20 1
a20 4
Perl itself and its standard library is using 2.9 MB disk space.
Unicode support and some other modules are left out. (For details,
please look into epoc/createpkg.pl). If you like to use these modules,
you are free to copy them from a current perl release.
d22 3
a24 1
=head1 STARTING PERL ON EPOC
d26 1
a26 6
For ER5 machines, you can get the software Perlstart
http://www.science-computing.de/o.flebbe/perl. It contains file
recognizers for files with the extension .pl and .pm. With it you can
start perl with a double click on the camel icon. Be sure to configure
the perl installation drive first. You can even provide a script with
a special commandline, if needed.
d28 2
a29 2
Alternativly you can get ESHELL from symbian: 
http://developer.epocworld.com/downloads/progs/Eshell.zip
d31 4
a34 4
Running ESHELL you can enter: perl -de 0 in order to run the perl
debugger. If you are leaving perl, you get into the system screen. You
have to switch back manually to ESHELL. When perl is running, you will
see a task with the name STDOUT in the task list. 
d36 2
a37 2
If you have a ER3 machine (i.e. a PSION 5), you may have to supply the
full path to the perl executable C:\system\programs\perl.exe.
d39 4
a42 2
If you need to set the current directory of perl, please use the
command line switch '-x'. See L<perlrun> for details.
d44 3
a46 10
=head1 STOPPING PERL ON EPOC

You can stop a running perl process in the task list by closing the
application `STDOUT'. You cannot stop a running perl process if it has
not written anyting to stdout or stderr! Be very cautious with I/O
redirection. You will have to reboot the PDA!

=head2 I/O Redirection

Alternatively you can use 2>&1 in order to add the standard error
d58 3
a60 23
=head2 PATH Names

ESHELL looks for executables in ?:/System/Programs. The SIS file
installs perl in this special folder directory. The default drive and
path are the same as folder the executable resides. The EPOC
filesystem is case-preserving, not case-sensitive.

The EPOC estdlib uses the ?: syntax for establishing a search order:
First in C: (RAM), then on D: (CF Card, if present) and last in Z:
(ROM). For instance ?:\a.txt searches for C:\a.txt, D:\a.txt (and
Z:\a.txt)

The perl @@INC search path is implemented with '?:'. Your perl
executable can live on a different drive than the perl library or even
your scripts.

ESHELL paths have to be written with backslashes '\', file arguments
to perl with slashes '/'. Remember that I/O redirection is done
internally in perl, so please use slashes for redirects.

perl.exe C:/test.pl >C:/output.txt
