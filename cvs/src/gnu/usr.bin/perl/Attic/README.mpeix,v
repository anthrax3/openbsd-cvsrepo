@Perl/iX for HP 3000 MPE

http://www.cccd.edu/~markb/perlix.html
Perl language for MPE
Last updated July 15, 1998 @@ 2030 UTC

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

What's New

   * July 15, 1998
        o Changed startperl to #!/PERL/PUB/perl so that Perl will recognize
          scripts more easily and efficiently.
   * July 8, 1998
        o Updated to version 5.004_70 (internal developer release) which is
          now MPE-ready.  The next public freeware release of Perl should
          compile "straight out of the box" on MPE.  Note that this version
          of Perl/iX was strictly internal to me and never publicly
          released.  Note that BIND/iX is now required (well, the include
          files and libbind.a) if you wish to compile Perl/iX.
   * November 6, 1997
        o Updated to version 5.004_04.  No changes in MPE-specific
          functionality.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Welcome

This is the official home page for the HP 3000 MPE port of the Perl
scripting language which gives you all of the power of C, awk, sed, and sh
in a single language. Check here for the latest news, implemented
functionality, known bugs, to-do list, etc. Status reports about major
milestones will also be posted to the HP3000-L mailing list and its
associated gatewayed newsgroup comp.sys.hp.mpe.

I'm doing this port because I can't live without Perl on the HPUX machines
that I administer for the Coast Community College District, and I want to
have the same power available to me on MPE.

Please send your comments, questions, and bug reports directly to me, Mark
Bixby, by e-mailing to markb@@cccd.edu. Or just post them to HP3000-L. You
can also telephone me at +1 714 438-4647 Monday-Friday 0815-1745 PDT
(1615-0145 UTC).

The platform I'm using to do this port is an HP 3000 969KS200 running
MPE/iX 5.5 and using the gcc 2.8 compiler from
http://www.interex.org/sources/freeware.html.

The combined porting wisdom from all of my ports can be found in my MPE/iX
Porting Guide.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

System Requirements

   * MPE/iX 5.5 or later. This version of Perl/iX does NOT run on MPE/iX
     5.0 or earlier, nor does it run on "classic" MPE/V machines.
   * The Perl binary requires that you must have converted your NMRL
     libraries in /lib/lib*.a and /usr/lib/lib*.a to NMXL libraries
     /lib/lib*.sl and /usr/lib/lib*.sl via the LIBSHP3K script that comes
     with the GNUCORE portion of the  FREEWARE tape.
   * If you wish to recompile Perl, you must install both GNUCORE and
     GNUGCC from the FREEWARE tape.
   * Perl/iX will be happier if you install the MPEKX76A additional POSIX
     filename characters patch, but this is optional.
   * If you will be compiling Perl/iX yourself, you will also need the
     /BIND/PUB/include and /BIND/PUB/lib portions of BIND/iX.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Demos

Here is a brief selection of some sample Perl/iX uses:

   * A web feedback CGI form that lets a web browser user enter some data
     and send e-mail to the person responsible for reading the feedback
     comments.  The CGI is written in Perl and requires Sendmail/iX.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

How to Obtain Perl/iX

  1. Download Perl using either FTP.ARPA.SYS or some other client
  2. Extract the installation script
  3. Edit the installation script
  4. Run the installation script

Download Perl using FTP.ARPA.SYS from your HP 3000 (the preferred
method).....

:HELLO MANAGER.SYS
:XEQ FTP.ARPA.SYS
open ftp.cccd.edu
anonymous
your@@email.address
bytestream
cd /pub/mpe
get perl5.005.tar.Z /tmp/perl.tar.Z
exit

.....Or download using some other generic web or ftp client (the alternate
method)

Download the following files (make sure that you use "binary mode" or
whatever client feature that is 8-bit clean):

   * Perl from http://www.cccd.edu/ftp/pub/mpe/perl5.005.tar.Z or
     ftp://ftp.cccd.edu/pub/mpe/perl5.005.tar.Z

Upload those files to your HP 3000 in an 8-bit clean bytestream manner to:

   * /tmp/perl.tar.Z

Then extract the installation script (after both download methods)

:CHDIR /tmp
:XEQ TAR.HPBIN.SYS 'xvfopz /tmp/perl.tar.Z INSTALL'

Edit the installation script

Examine the accounting structure creation commands and modify if necessary
(adding additional capabilities, choosing a non-system volume set, etc).

:XEQ VI.HPBIN.SYS /tmp/INSTALL

Run the installation script

The accounting structure will be created and then all files will be
extracted from the archive.

:XEQ SH.HPBIN.SYS /tmp/INSTALL

How to Compile Perl/iX

  1. cd src/perl5.005
  2. Read the INSTALL file for the official instructions
  3. ./Configure
  4. make
  5. ./mpeix/relink
  6. make test (expect 31 out of 5899 subtests to fail, mostly due to MPE
     not supporting hard links and handling exit() return codes improperly)
  7. make install
  8. Optionally create symbolic links that point to the Perl executable,
     i.e. ln -s /usr/local/bin/perl /PERL/PUB/PERL

Failed 6/183 test scripts, 96.72% okay. 31/5899 subtests failed, 99.47% okay.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Getting Started with Perl/iX

Create your Perl script files with "#!/PERL/PUB/perl" (or an equivalent
symbolic link) as the first line.  Use the chmod command to make sure that
your script has execute permission. Run your script!

If you want to use Perl to write web server CGI scripts, obtain and install
CGI.pm. Build CGI.pm and all other add-on modules below /PERL/PUB/src/.

Be sure to take a look at the CPAN module list. A wide variety of free Perl
software is available.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

MPE/iX Implementation Considerations

There some minor functionality issues to be aware of when comparing Perl
for Unix (Perl/UX) to Perl/iX:

   * MPE gcc/ld doesn't properly support linking NMPRG executables against
     NMXL dynamic libraries, so you must manually run mpeix/relink after
     each re-build of Perl.
   * Perl/iX File::Copy will use MPE's /bin/cp command to copy files by
     name in order to preserve file attributes like file code.
   * MPE (and thus Perl/iX) lacks support for setgrent(), endgrent(),
     setpwent(), endpwent().
   * MPE (and thus Perl/iX) lacks support for hard links.
   * MPE requires GETPRIVMODE() in order to bind() to ports less than
     1024.  Perl/iX will call GETPRIVMODE() automatically on your behalf if
     you attempt to bind() to these low-numbered ports.  Note that the
     Perl/iX executable and the PERL account do not normally have CAP=PM,
     so if you will be bind()-ing to these privileged ports, you will
     manually need to add PM capability as appropriate.
   * MPE requires that you bind() to an IP address of zero.  Perl/iX
     automatically replaces the IP address that you pass to bind() with a
     zero.
   * If you use Perl/iX fcntl() against a socket it will fail, because MPE
     requires that you use sfcntl() instead.  Perl/iX does not presently
     support sfcntl().
   * MPE requires GETPRIVMODE() in order to setuid().  There are too many
     calls to setuid() within Perl/iX, so I have not attempted an automatic
     GETPRIVMODE() solution similar to bind().

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Known Bugs Under Investigation

   * None

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

To-Do List

   * Make setuid()/setgid() support work.
   * Make sure that fcntl() against a socket descriptor is redirected to
     sfcntl().
   * Add support for Berkeley DB once I've finished porting Berkeley DB.
   * Write an MPE XS extension library containing miscellaneous important
     MPE functions like GETPRIVMODE(), GETUSERMODE(), and sfcntl().

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Change History

   * October 16, 1997
        o Added Demos section to the Perl/iX home page so you can see some
          sample Perl applications running on my 3000.
   * October 3, 1997
        o Added System Requirements section to the Perl/iX home page just
          so the prerequisites stand out more. Various other home page
          tweaks.
   * October 2, 1997
        o Initial public release.
   * September 1997
        o Porting begins.

=item *

Rebuilt to be compatible with mod_perl.  If you plan on using
mod_perl, you MUST download and install this version of Perl/iX!
       
=item *

bincompat5005="undef": sorry, but you will have to recompile any
binary 5.005 extensions that you may be using (if any; there is no
5.005 code in what you download from bixby.org)
uselargefiles="undef": not available in MPE for POSIX files yet.
       
=item *

Now bundled with various add-on packages:

=over 8

=item *

libnet (http://www.gbarr.demon.co.uk/libnet/FAQ.html)

=item *

libwww-perl (LWP) which lets Perl programs behave like web browsers:
       
    1. #!/PERL/PUB/perl
    2. use LWP::Simple;
    3. $doc = get('http://www.bixby.org/mark/perlix.html');  # reads the
       web page into variable $doc
       
(http://www.bixby.org/mark/perlix.html)

=item *

mod_perl (just the perl portion; the actual DSO will be released
soon with Apache/iX 1.3.12 from bixby.org).  This module allows you to
write high performance persistent Perl CGI scripts and all sorts of
cool things. (http://perl.apache.org/)
   
and much much more hiding under /PERL/PUB/.cpan/
   
=item *

The CPAN module now works for automatic downloading and
installing of add-on packages:

    1. export FTP_PASSIVE=1
    2. perl -MCPAN -e shell
    3. Ignore any terminal I/O related complaints!

=head1 Getting Started with Perl/iX

Create your Perl script files with "#!/PERL/PUB/perl" (or an
equivalent symbolic link) as the first line.  Use the chmod command to
make sure that your script has execute permission. Run your script!
   
Be sure to take a look at the CPAN module list
(http://www.cpan.org/CPAN.html). A wide variety of free Perl software
is available.  You can automatically download these packages by using
the CPAN module (http://theoryx5.uwinnipeg.ca/CPAN/data/perl/CPAN.html).

=head1 MPE/iX Implementation Considerations

There some minor functionality issues to be aware of when comparing
Perl for Unix (Perl/UX) to Perl/iX:

=over 4

=item *

MPE gcc/ld doesn't properly support linking NMPRG executables against
NMXL dynamic libraries, so you must manually run mpeix/relink after
each re-build of Perl.

=item *

Perl/iX File::Copy will use MPE's /bin/cp command to copy files by
name in order to preserve file attributes like file code.

=item *

MPE (and thus Perl/iX) lacks support for setgrent(), endgrent(),
setpwent(), endpwent().

=item *

MPE (and thus Perl/iX) lacks support for hard links.

=item *

MPE requires GETPRIVMODE() in order to bind() to ports less than 1024.
Perl/iX will call GETPRIVMODE() automatically on your behalf if you
attempt to bind() to these low-numbered ports.  Note that the Perl/iX
executable and the PERL account do not normally have CAP=PM, so if you
will be bind()-ing to these privileged ports, you will manually need
to add PM capability as appropriate.

=item *

MPE requires that you bind() to an IP address of zero.  Perl/iX
automatically replaces the IP address that you pass to bind() with
a zero.

=item *

If you use Perl/iX fcntl() against a socket it will fail, because MPE
requires that you use sfcntl() instead.  Perl/iX does not presently
support sfcntl().

=item *

MPE requires GETPRIVMODE() in order to setuid().  There are too many
calls to setuid() within Perl/iX, so I have not attempted an automatic
GETPRIVMODE() solution similar to bind().

=back
   
=head1 Known Bugs Under Investigation

None.
   
=head1 To-Do List

=over 4

=item *

Make setuid()/setgid() support work.

=item *

Make sure that fcntl() against a socket descriptor is redirected to sfcntl().

=item *

Add support for Berkeley DB once I've finished porting Berkeley DB.

=item *

Write an MPE XS extension library containing miscellaneous important
MPE functions like GETPRIVMODE(), GETUSERMODE(), and sfcntl().
   
=back

=head1 Change History

May 6, 1999

Patch LBCJXT6A is required on MPE/iX 5.5 machines in order to prevent
Perl/iX from dying with an unresolved external reference to _getenv_libc.

Updated for perl-5.8.8 and perl-5.9.3 by Ken Hirsch.

Simplified the build process by using the MPEAUTOCONF
functionality in Mark Klein's ld.

If you build this from scratch, make sure you have a version
of ld which supports it.  In the shell, type

  ld --help
    and look for AUTOCONF or MPEAUTOCONF near the bottom

  or do this:
  ld --help 2>&1 | grep AUTOCONF

If you see don't see AUTOCONF or MPEAUTOCONF, make sure you get a new
version.

You also do not have to use mpeix/relink after building, so the
recommend sequence is:

  ./Configure -de

      # or ./Configure -de -Dusedevel 
      # if you're building a development version

  make
  make test
     # if you run this in a job, do "make test_notty"

  make install

Be prepared for a wait. These take much longer on MPE/iX than on a Unix
system, because of a slow forking, mostly.  On a lightly-loaded HP3000
Series 979 running MPE/iX 7.5:

    Configure: 1 hour
    make:      1 hour 15 minutes
    make test  1 hour 45 minutes

Various socket problems were fixed in mpeix.c.

Mark Klein provided a fixed sigsetjmp (that works with dynamic
libraries) in mpeix_setjmp.c
