Text::Wrap is a very simple paragraph formatter.  It formats a
single paragraph at a time by breaking lines at word boundries.
Indentation is controlled for the first line ($initial_tab) and
all subsquent lines ($subsequent_tab) independently.  $Text::Wrap::columns
should be set to the full width of your output device.
