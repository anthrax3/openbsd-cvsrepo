# optimisations. Thus it is a sort of canary for optimisations being
# broken.
#
# Although it includes a watchdog timeout, this is set to a generous limit
# to allow for running on slow systems; therefore a broken optimisation
# might be indicated merely by this test file taking unusually long to
# run, rather than actually timing out.
