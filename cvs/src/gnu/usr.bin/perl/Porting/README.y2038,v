@The y2038 implementation for perl
===========================================================================
This is an implementation of POSIX time.h which solves the year 2038 bug on
systems where time_t is only 32 bits.  It is implemented in bog-standard
ANSI C.  The latest version can be found at http://y2038.googlecode.com/

It makes use of the system's native 32 bit functions to perform time zone
and daylight savings time calculations and thus does *not* need to ship its
own time zone table.

time64.h currently implements three public functions, localtime64_r(),
gmtime64_r() and timegm64().  They are implementations of localtime_r(),
gmtime_r() and timegm64().

To install, simply copy time64.c and time64.h into your project and make
use of the functions.

To test, run "make test".  You must have Perl, prove (which comes with a
recent version of the Test::Harness Perl module) and bzdiff installed to
run the full test suite.  It will do a number of unit tests, plus test
against a large table of known good values in different time zones.

Limitations, Issues, etc...
---------------------------
localtime64_r() gets its time zone and daylight savings time information by
mappping the future year back to a similar one between 2010 and 2037, safe
for localtime_r().  The calculations are accurate according to current time
zone and daylight savings information, but may become inaccurate if a
change is made that takes place after 2010.

Future versions will probe for a 64 bit safe system localtime_r() and
gmtime_r() and use that.

The maximum date is still limited by your tm struct.  Most 32 bit systems
use a signed integer tm_year which means the practical upper limit is the
year 2147483647 which is somewhere around 2**54.  You can use a 64 bit
clean tm struct by setting USE_TM64 in time64.h

Portability
-----------
I would like to add some configuration detection stuff in the future, but
for now all I can do is document the assumptions...

This code assumes that long longs are 64 bit integers which is technically
in violation of the C standard.  This can be changed in time64.h by
changing the Time64_T and Int64 typedefs.

There are a number of configuration options in time64.h.

Configure variables
-------------------
Configure probes for the maximum and minimum values that gmtime () and
localtime () accept on the local system. Configure however is only used on
unix-like systems. For windows and VMS these values are hard-coded. You can
use timecheck.c in the Porting directory to check those values yourself,
using the same technique that is used in Configure based on bit-shifting:

  $ cd perl/Porting
  $ cc -O -o timecheck timecheck.c
  $ ./timecheck
  ======================
  Sizeof time_t = 8
  gmtime () boundaries:
    8:  0x00f0c2ab7c54a97f:   2147485547-12-31 23:59:59
    8: -0x0000000e79747c00:            0-01-01 00:00:00
  localtime () boundaries:
    8:  0x00f0c2ab7c549b6f:   2147485547-12-31 23:59:59
    8: -0x0000000e79748094:            0-01-01 00:00:00
  Configure variables:
  sGMTIME_max='67768036191676799'
  sGMTIME_min='-62167219200'
  sLOCALTIME_max='67768036191673199'
  sLOCALTIME_min='-62167220372'

In the rare case that your system uses a double for time_t, you can use the
alternate approach to test for these values:

  $ cd perl/Porting
  $ cc -O -o timecheck2{,.c}
  $ ./timecheck2
                gmtime max 67768036191676800
             localtime max 67768036191673200
                gmtime min -67768040609740800
             localtime min -67768040609741968
