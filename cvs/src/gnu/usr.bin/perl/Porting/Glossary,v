!!!!!!!   DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE   !!!!!!!
This file is built by metaconfig.

This file contains a description of all the shell variables whose value is
determined by the Configure script.  Variables intended for use in C
programs (e.g. I_UNISTD) are already described in config_h.SH.  [`configpm'
generates pod documentation for Config.pm from this file--please try to keep
the formatting regular.]

_a (Unix.U):
	This variable defines the extension used for ordinary library files.
	For unix, it is '.a'.  The '.' is included.  Other possible
	values include '.lib'.

_exe (Unix.U):
	This variable defines the extension used for executable files.
	DJGPP, Cygwin and OS/2 use '.exe'.  Stratus VOS uses '.pm'.
	On operating systems which do not require a specific extension
	for executable files, this variable is empty.

_o (Unix.U):
	This variable defines the extension used for object files.
	For unix, it is '.o'.  The '.' is included.  Other possible
	values include '.obj'.

afs (afs.U):
	This variable is set to 'true' if AFS (Andrew File System) is used
	on the system, 'false' otherwise.  It is possible to override this
	with a hint value or command line option, but you'd better know
	what you are doing.

afsroot (afs.U):
	This variable is by default set to '/afs'. In the unlikely case
	this is not the correct root, it is possible to override this with
	a hint value or command line option.  This will be used in subsequent
	tests for AFSness in the configure and test process.

alignbytes (alignbytes.U):
	This variable holds the number of bytes required to align a
	double-- or a long double when applicable. Usual values are
	2, 4 and 8.  The default is eight, for safety.

ansi2knr (ansi2knr.U):
	This variable is set if the user needs to run ansi2knr.
	Currently, this is not supported, so we just abort.

aphostname (d_gethname.U):
	This variable contains the command which can be used to compute the
	host name. The command is fully qualified by its absolute path, to make
	it safe when used by a process with super-user privileges.

api_revision (patchlevel.U):
	The three variables, api_revision, api_version, and
	api_subversion, specify the version of the oldest perl binary
	compatible with the present perl.  In a full version string
	such as '5.6.1', api_revision is the '5'.
	Prior to 5.5.640, the format was a floating point number,
	like 5.00563.

	perl.c:incpush() and lib/lib.pm will automatically search in
	$sitelib/.. for older directories back to the limit specified
	by these api_ variables.  This is only useful if you have a
	perl library directory tree structured like the default one.
	See INSTALL for how this works.  The versioned site_perl
	directory was introduced in 5.005, so that is the lowest
	possible value.  The version list appropriate for the current
	system is determined in inc_version_list.U.

	XXX To do:  Since compatibility can depend on compile time
	options (such as bincompat, longlong, etc.) it should
	(perhaps) be set by Configure, but currently it isn't.
	Currently, we read a hard-wired value from patchlevel.h.
	Perhaps what we ought to do is take the hard-wired value from
	patchlevel.h but then modify it if the current Configure
	options warrant.  patchlevel.h then would use an #ifdef guard.

api_subversion (patchlevel.U):
	The three variables, api_revision, api_version, and
	api_subversion, specify the version of the oldest perl binary
	compatible with the present perl.  In a full version string
	such as '5.6.1', api_subversion is the '1'.  See api_revision for
	full details.

api_version (patchlevel.U):
	The three variables, api_revision, api_version, and
	api_subversion, specify the version of the oldest perl binary
	compatible with the present perl.  In a full version string
	such as '5.6.1', api_version is the '6'.  See api_revision for
	full details.  As a special case, 5.5.0 is rendered in the
	old-style as 5.005.  (In the 5.005_0x maintenance series,
	this was the only versioned directory in $sitelib.)

api_versionstring (patchlevel.U):
	This variable combines api_revision, api_version, and
	api_subversion in a format such as 5.6.1 (or 5_6_1) suitable
	for use as a directory name.  This is filesystem dependent.

ar (Loc.U):
	This variable is used internally by Configure to determine the
	full pathname (if any) of the ar program.  After Configure runs,
	the value is reset to a plain "ar" and is not useful.

archlib (archlib.U):
	This variable holds the name of the directory in which the user wants
	to put architecture-dependent public library files for $package.
	It is most often a local directory such as /usr/local/lib.
	Programs using this variable must be prepared to deal
	with filename expansion.

archlibexp (archlib.U):
	This variable is the same as the archlib variable, but is
	filename expanded at configuration time, for convenient use.

archname (archname.U):
	This variable is a short name to characterize the current
	architecture.  It is used mainly to construct the default archlib.

archname64 (use64bits.U):
	This variable is used for the 64-bitness part of $archname.

archobjs (Unix.U):
	This variable defines any additional objects that must be linked
	in with the program on this architecture.  On unix, it is usually
	empty.  It is typically used to include emulations of unix calls
	or other facilities.  For perl on OS/2, for example, this would
	include os2/os2.obj.

asctime_r_proto (d_asctime_r.U):
	This variable encodes the prototype of asctime_r.
	It is zero if d_asctime_r is undef, and one of the
	REENTRANT_PROTO_T_ABC macros of reentr.h if d_asctime_r
	is defined.

awk (Loc.U):
	This variable is used internally by Configure to determine the
	full pathname (if any) of the awk program.  After Configure runs,
	the value is reset to a plain "awk" and is not useful.

baserev (baserev.U):
	The base revision level of this package, from the .package file.

bash (Loc.U):
	This variable is defined but not used by Configure.
	The value is the empty string and is not useful.

bin (bin.U):
	This variable holds the name of the directory in which the user wants
	to put publicly executable images for the package in question.  It
	is most often a local directory such as /usr/local/bin. Programs using
	this variable must be prepared to deal with ~name substitution.

bin_ELF (dlsrc.U):
	This variable saves the result from configure if generated binaries
	are in ELF format. Only set to defined when the test has actually
	been performed, and the result was positive.

binexp (bin.U):
	This is the same as the bin variable, but is filename expanded at
	configuration time, for use in your makefiles.

bison (Loc.U):
	This variable is used internally by Configure to determine the
	full pathname (if any) of the bison program.  After Configure runs,
	the value is reset to a plain "bison" and is not useful.

byacc (Loc.U):
	This variable is used internally by Configure to determine the
	full pathname (if any) of the byacc program.  After Configure runs,
	the value is reset to a plain "byacc" and is not useful.

byteorder (byteorder.U):
	This variable holds the byte order in a UV. In the following,
	larger digits indicate more significance.  The variable byteorder
	is either 4321 on a big-endian machine, or 1234 on a little-endian,
	or 87654321 on a Cray ... or 3412 with weird order !

c (n.U):
	This variable contains the \c string if that is what causes the echo
	command to suppress newline.  Otherwise it is null.  Correct usage is
	$echo $n "prompt for a question: $c".

castflags (d_castneg.U):
	This variable contains a flag that precise difficulties the
	compiler has casting odd floating values to unsigned long:
	0 = ok
	1 = couldn't cast < 0
	2 = couldn't cast >= 0x80000000
	4 = couldn't cast in argument expression list

cat (Loc.U):
	This variable is used internally by Configure to determine the
	full pathname (if any) of the cat program.  After Configure runs,
	the value is reset to a plain "cat" and is not useful.

cc (cc.U):
	This variable holds the name of a command to execute a C compiler which
	can resolve multiple global references that happen to have the same
	name.  Usual values are 'cc' and 'gcc'.
	Fervent ANSI compilers may be called 'c89'.  AIX has xlc.

cccdlflags (dlsrc.U):
	This variable contains any special flags that might need to be
	passed with 'cc -c' to compile modules to be used to create a shared
	library that will be used for dynamic loading.  For hpux, this
	should be +z.  It is up to the makefile to use it.

ccdlflags (dlsrc.U):
	This variable contains any special flags that might need to be
	passed to cc to link with a shared library for dynamic loading.
	It is up to the makefile to use it.  For sunos 4.1, it should
	be empty.

ccflags (ccflags.U):
	This variable contains any additional C compiler flags desired by
	the user.  It is up to the Makefile to use this.

ccflags_uselargefiles (uselfs.U):
	This variable contains the compiler flags needed by large file builds
	and added to ccflags by hints files.

ccname (Checkcc.U):
	This can set either by hints files or by Configure.  If using
	gcc, this is gcc, and if not, usually equal to cc, unimpressive, no?
	Some platforms, however, make good use of this by storing the
	flavor of the C compiler being used here.  For example if using
	the Sun WorkShop suite, ccname will be 'workshop'.

ccsymbols (Cppsym.U):
	The variable contains the symbols defined by the C compiler alone.
	The symbols defined by cpp or by cc when it calls cpp are not in
	this list, see cppsymbols and cppccsymbols.
	The list is a space-separated list of symbol=value tokens.

ccversion (Checkcc.U):
	This can set either by hints files or by Configure.  If using
	a (non-gcc) vendor cc, this variable may contain a version for
	the compiler.

cf_by (cf_who.U):
	Login name of the person who ran the Configure script and answered the
	questions. This is used to tag both config.sh and config_h.SH.

cf_email (cf_email.U):
	Electronic mail address of the person who ran Configure. This can be
	used by units that require the user's e-mail, like MailList.U.

cf_time (cf_who.U):
	Holds the output of the "date" command when the configuration file was
	produced. This is used to tag both config.sh and config_h.SH.

charbits (charsize.U):
	This variable contains the value of the CHARBITS symbol, which
	indicates to the C program how many bits there are in a character.

charsize (charsize.U):
	This variable contains the value of the CHARSIZE symbol, which
	indicates to the C program how many bytes there are in a character.

chgrp (Loc.U):
	This variable is defined but not used by Configure.
	The value is the empty string and is not useful.

chmod (Loc.U):
	This variable is used internally by Configure to determine the
	full pathname (if any) of the chmod program.  After Configure runs,
	the value is reset to a plain "chmod" and is not useful.

chown (Loc.U):
	This variable is defined but not used by Configure.
	The value is the empty string and is not useful.

clocktype (d_times.U):
	This variable holds the type returned by times(). It can be long,
	or clock_t on BSD sites (in which case <sys/types.h> should be
	included).

comm (Loc.U):
	This variable is used internally by Configure to determine the
	full pathname (if any) of the comm program.  After Configure runs,
	the value is reset to a plain "comm" and is not useful.

compress (Loc.U):
	This variable is defined but not used by Configure.
	The value is the empty string and is not useful.

config_arg0 (Options.U):
	This variable contains the string used to invoke the Configure
	command, as reported by the shell in the $0 variable.

config_argc (Options.U):
	This variable contains the number of command-line arguments
	passed to Configure, as reported by the shell in the $# variable.
	The individual arguments are stored as variables config_arg1,
	config_arg2, etc.

config_args (Options.U):
	This variable contains a single string giving the command-line
	arguments passed to Configure.	Spaces within arguments,
	quotes, and escaped characters are not correctly preserved.
	To reconstruct the command line, you must assemble the individual
	command line pieces, given in config_arg[0-9]*.

contains (contains.U):
	This variable holds the command to do a grep with a proper return
	status.  On most sane systems it is simply "grep".  On insane systems
	it is a grep followed by a cat followed by a test.  This variable
	is primarily for the use of other Configure units.

cp (Loc.U):
	This variable is used internally by Configure to determine the
	full pathname (if any) of the cp program.  After Configure runs,
	the value is reset to a plain "cp" and is not useful.

cpio (Loc.U):
	This variable is defined but not used by Configure.
	The value is the empty string and is not useful.

cpp (Loc.U):
	This variable is used internally by Configure to determine the
	full pathname (if any) of the cpp program.  After Configure runs,
	the value is reset to a plain "cpp" and is not useful.

cpp_stuff (cpp_stuff.U):
	This variable contains an identification of the concatenation mechanism
	used by the C preprocessor.

cppccsymbols (Cppsym.U):
	The variable contains the symbols defined by the C compiler
	when it calls cpp.  The symbols defined by the cc alone or cpp
	alone are not in this list, see ccsymbols and cppsymbols.
	The list is a space-separated list of symbol=value tokens.

cppflags (ccflags.U):
	This variable holds the flags that will be passed to the C pre-
	processor. It is up to the Makefile to use it.

cpplast (cppstdin.U):
	This variable has the same functionality as cppminus, only it applies
	to cpprun and not cppstdin.

cppminus (cppstdin.U):
	This variable contains the second part of the string which will invoke
	the C preprocessor on the standard input and produce to standard
	output.  This variable will have the value "-" if cppstdin needs
	a minus to specify standard input, otherwise the value is "".

cpprun (cppstdin.U):
	This variable contains the command which will invoke a C preprocessor
	on standard input and put the output to stdout. It is guaranteed not
	to be a wrapper and may be a null string if no preprocessor can be
	made directly available. This preprocessor might be different from the
	one used by the C compiler. Don't forget to append cpplast after the
	preprocessor options.

cppstdin (cppstdin.U):
	This variable contains the command which will invoke the C
	preprocessor on standard input and put the output to stdout.
	It is primarily used by other Configure units that ask about
	preprocessor symbols.

cppsymbols (Cppsym.U):
	The variable contains the symbols defined by the C preprocessor
	alone.  The symbols defined by cc or by cc when it calls cpp are
	not in this list, see ccsymbols and cppccsymbols.
	The list is a space-separated list of symbol=value tokens.

crypt_r_proto (d_crypt_r.U):
	This variable encodes the prototype of crypt_r.
	It is zero if d_crypt_r is undef, and one of the
	REENTRANT_PROTO_T_ABC macros of reentr.h if d_crypt_r
	is defined.

cryptlib (d_crypt.U):
	This variable holds -lcrypt or the path to a libcrypt.a archive if
	the crypt() function is not defined in the standard C library. It is
	up to the Makefile to use this.

csh (Loc.U):

	libraries (libfoo.so.x.y) are to be ignored (because they
	cannot be linked against).

inc_version_list (inc_version_list.U):
	This variable specifies the list of subdirectories in over
	which perl.c:incpush() and lib/lib.pm will automatically
	search when adding directories to @@INC.  The elements in
	the list are separated by spaces.  This is only useful
	if you have a perl library directory tree structured like the
	default one.  See INSTALL for how this works.  The versioned
	site_perl directory was introduced in 5.005, so that is the
	lowest possible value.

	This list includes architecture-dependent directories back to
	version $api_versionstring (e.g. 5.5.640) and
	architecture-independent directories all the way back to
	5.005.

inc_version_list_init (inc_version_list.U):

	each item is enclosed in double quotes and separated by commas,
	suitable for use in the PERL_INC_VERSION_LIST initialization.

	When userelocatableinc is true, this variable holds the location
	that make install should copy the perl binary to, with all the
	run-time relocatable paths calculated from this at install time.
	When used, it is initialized to the original value of binexp, and
	then binexp is set to '.../', as the other binaries are found
	relative to the perl binary.

	portability, you should only use this variable within your makefiles.

installprefix (installprefix.U):
	This variable holds the name of the directory below which
	"make install" will install the package.  For most users, this
	is the same as prefix.  However, it is useful for
	installing the software into a different (usually temporary)
	location after which it can be bundled up and moved somehow
	to the final location specified by prefix.

installprefixexp (installprefix.U):
	This variable holds the full absolute path of installprefix
	with all ~-expansion done.

installprivlib (privlib.U):

	portability, you should only use this variable within your makefiles.

installsitescript (sitescript.U):
	This variable is usually the same as sitescriptexp, unless you are on
	a system running AFS, in which case they may differ slightly. You
	should always use this variable within your makefiles for portability.

installstyle (installstyle.U):
	This variable describes the "style" of the perl installation.
	This is intended to be useful for tools that need to
	manipulate entire perl distributions.  Perl itself doesn't use
	this to find its libraries -- the library directories are
	stored directly in Config.pm.  Currently, there are only two
	styles:  "lib" and "lib/perl5".  The default library locations
	(e.g. privlib, sitelib) are either $prefix/lib or
	$prefix/lib/perl5.  The former is useful if $prefix is a
	directory dedicated to perl (e.g. /opt/perl), while the latter
	is useful if $prefix is shared by many packages, e.g. if
	$prefix=/usr/local.

	Unfortunately, while this "style" variable is used to set
	defaults for all three directory hierarchies (core, vendor, and
	site), there is no guarantee that the same style is actually
	appropriate for all those directories.  For example, $prefix
	might be /opt/perl, but $siteprefix might be /usr/local.
	(Perhaps, in retrospect, the "lib" style should never have been
	supported, but it did seem like a nice idea at the time.)

	The situation is even less clear for tools such as MakeMaker
	that can be used to install additional modules into
	non-standard places.  For example, if a user intends to install
	a module into a private directory (perhaps by setting PREFIX on
	the Makefile.PL command line), then there is no reason to
	assume that the Configure-time $installstyle setting will be
	relevant for that PREFIX.

	This may later be extended to include other information, so
	be careful with pattern-matching on the results.

	For compatibility with perl5.005 and earlier, the default
	setting is based on whether or not $prefix contains the string
	"perl".

	those which where not.  See "extensions" for the list of extensions
	actually built and available.

	This variable contains comma-separated list of hexadecimal bytes
	for the long double precision not-a-number.

	make_set_make="MAKE=$make"	# if it doesn't.

	This uses a comment character so that we can distinguish a
	'set' value (from a previous config.sh or Configure '-D' option)
	from an uncomputed value.

	and mistrustnm is false, this variable has no effect.  If usenm is true
	and mistrustnm is "compile", a test program will be compiled to try to
	find any symbol that can't be located via nm lookup.  If mistrustnm is
	"run", the test program will be run as well as being compiled.

mkdir (Loc.U):
	This variable is used internally by Configure to determine the

	This variable conditionally defines the MULTIARCH symbol
	which signifies the presence of multiplatform files.
	This is normally set by hints files.

mv (Loc.U):
	This variable is defined but not used by Configure.
	The value is the empty string and is not useful.

myarchname (archname.U):

	a previous run. It is not intended to be perused by any user and
	should never be set in a hint file.

mydomain (myhostname.U):
	This variable contains the eventual value of the MYDOMAIN symbol,
	which is the domain of the host the program is going to run on.
	The domain must be appended to myhostname to form a complete host name.
	The dot comes with mydomain, and need not be supplied by the program.

myhostname (myhostname.U):
	This variable contains the eventual value of the MYHOSTNAME symbol,
	which is the name of the host the program is going to run on.
	The domain is not kept with hostname, but must be gotten from mydomain.
	The dot comes with mydomain, and need not be supplied by the program.

myuname (Oldconfig.U):
	The output of 'uname -a' if available, otherwise the hostname.
	The whole thing is then lower-cased and slashes and single quotes are
	removed.

n (n.U):
	This variable contains the '-n' flag if that is what causes the echo
	command to suppress newline.  Otherwise it is null.  Correct usage is
	$echo $n "prompt for a question: $c".

need_va_copy (need_va_copy.U):
	This symbol, if defined, indicates that the system stores
	the variable argument list datatype, va_list, in a format
	that cannot be copied by simple assignment, so that some
	other means must be used when copying is required.
	As such systems vary in their provision (or non-provision)
	of copying mechanisms, handy.h defines a platform-
	independent macro, Perl_va_copy(src, dst), to do the job.

netdb_hlen_type (netdbtype.U):
	This variable holds the type used for the 2nd argument to
	gethostbyaddr().  Usually, this is int or size_t or unsigned.
	This is only useful if you have gethostbyaddr(), naturally.

	This variable holds the type used for the 1st argument to
	gethostbyaddr().  Usually, this is char * or void *,  possibly
	with or without a const prefix.

	This variable holds the options that may be necessary for nm.

nm_so_opt (usenm.U):
	This variable holds the options that may be necessary for nm
	to work on a shared library but that can not be used on an
	archive library.  Currently, this is only used by Linux, where
	nm --dynamic is *required* to get symbols from an ELF library which
	has been stripped, but nm --dynamic is *fatal* on an archive library.
	Maybe Linux should just always set usenm=false.

nonxs_ext (Extensions.U):
	This variable holds a list of all non-xs extensions built and
	installed by the package.  By default, all non-xs extensions
	distributed will be built, with the exception of platform-specific
	extensions (currently only one VMS specific extension).

nroff (Loc.U):
	This variable is used internally by Configure to determine the
	full pathname (if any) of the nroff program.  After Configure runs,
	the value is reset to a plain "nroff" and is not useful.

o_nonblock (nblock_io.U):
	This variable bears the symbol value to be used during open() or fcntl()
	to turn on non-blocking I/O for a file descriptor. If you wish to switch
	between blocking and non-blocking, you may try ioctl(FIOSNBIO) instead,
	but that is only supported by some devices.

	This is an old synonym for _o.

old_pthread_create_joinable (d_pthrattrj.U):
	This variable defines the constant to use for creating joinable

	PTHREAD_CREATE_JOINABLE.  If used, possible values are
	PTHREAD_CREATE_UNDETACHED and __UNDETACHED.

optimize (ccflags.U):
	This variable contains any optimizer/debugger flag that should be used.
	It is up to the Makefile to use it.

orderlib (orderlib.U):
	This variable is "true" if the components of libraries must be ordered
	(with `lorder $* | tsort`) before placing them in an archive.  Set to
	"false" if ranlib or ar can generate random libraries.

	4.1.3, 5.2, etc.).  It is primarily used for helping select
	an appropriate hints file, but might be useful elsewhere for
	setting defaults.  It is set to '' if we can't figure it out.
	We try to be flexible about how much of the version number
	to keep, e.g. if 4.1.1, 4.1.2, and 4.1.3 are essentially the
	same for this package, hints files might just be os_4.0 or
	os_4.1, etc., not keeping separate files for each little release.

otherlibdirs (otherlibdirs.U):
	This variable contains a colon-separated set of paths for the perl
	binary to search for additional library files or modules.
	These directories will be tacked to the end of @@INC.
	Perl will automatically search below each path for version-

	for more details.
	A value of ' ' means 'none' and is used to preserve this value
	for the next run through Configure.

	This variable contains the name of the package being constructed.
	It is primarily intended for the use of later Configure units.

	On some systems, such as os390, there may be no equivalent
	command, in which case this variable is unset.

patchlevel (patchlevel.U):
	The patchlevel level of this package.
	The value of patchlevel comes from the patchlevel.h file.

	installed perl5.005 or later suitable for running the script
	to determine inc_version_list.

PERL_API_REVISION (patchlevel.h):

	which contains the name of the perl interpreter to be used in
	shell scripts and in the "eval 'exec'" idiom.  This variable is
	not necessarily the pathname of the file containing the perl
	interpreter; you must append the executable extension (_exe) if
	it is not already present.  Note that Perl code that runs during
	the Perl build process cannot reference this variable, as Perl
	may not have been installed, or even if installed, may be a
	different version of Perl.

rd_nodata (nblock_io.U):
	This variable holds the return code from read() when no data is
	present. It should be -1, but some systems return 0 when O_NDELAY is

	This unit comes before Options.U, so you can't set sh with a '-D'
	option, though you can override this (and startsh)
	with '-O -Dsh=/bin/whatever -Dstartsh=whatever'

shrpenv (libperl.U):
	If the user builds a shared libperl.so, then we need to tell the
	'perl' executable where it will be able to find the installed libperl.so.
	One way to do this on some systems is to set the environment variable

	Typical values are
	shrpenv="env LD_RUN_PATH=$archlibexp/CORE"
	or
	shrpenv=''

	perl idiom:
	eval 'exec perl -S $0 ${1+"$@@"}'
	if $running_under_some_shell;
	to guarantee perl startup should the shell execute the script. Note
	that this magic incantation is not understood by csh.

	This is unique to perl.

sysman (sysman.U):
	This variable holds the place where the manual is located on this
	system. It is not the place where the user wants to put his manual
	pages. Rather it is the place where Configure may look to find manual

	and indicates that 64-bit integer types should be used
	when available.  The maximal possible
	64-bitness is employed: LP64 or ILP64, meaning that you will
	be able to use more than 2 gigabytes of memory.  This mode is
	even more binary incompatible than USE_64_BIT_INT. You may not
	be able to run the resulting executable in a 32-bit CPU at all or

	special versions of malloc for efficiency, but such versions are often
	less portable.  See also mallocsrc and mallocobj.
	If this is 'y', then -lmalloc is removed from $libs.

usenm (usenm.U):
	This variable contains 'true' or 'false' depending whether the
	nm extraction is wanted or not.

usensgetexecutablepath (usensgetexecutablepath.U):

	This variable is set to true to indicate that perl should relocate
	@@INC entries at runtime based on the path to the perl binary.
	Any @@INC paths starting ".../" are relocated relative to the directory
	containing the perl binary, and a logical cleanup of the path is then
	made around the join point (removing "dir/../" pairs)

useshrplib (libperl.U):
	This variable is set to 'true' if the user wishes
	to build a shared libperl, and 'false' otherwise.

usesitecustomize (d_sitecustomize.U):

	This is suitable for use as a directory name, and hence is
	filesystem dependent.

version_patchlevel_string (patchlevel.U):
	This is a string combining version, subversion and
	perl_patchlevel (if perl_patchlevel is non-zero).
	It is typically something like

	If set, this symbol indicates that only the version-specific
	components of a perl installation should be installed.
	This may be useful for making a test installation of a new
	version without disturbing the existing installation.
	Setting versiononly is equivalent to setting installperl's -v option.
	In particular, the non-versioned scripts and programs such as
	a2p, c2ph, h2xs, pod2*, and perldoc are not installed
	(see INSTALL for a more complete list).  Nor are the man

	This variable contains any additional yacc flags desired by the
	user.  It is up to the Makefile to use this.

zcat (Loc.U):
	This variable is defined but not used by Configure.
	The value is the empty string and is not useful.

zip (Loc.U):
	This variable is used internally by Configure to determine the
	full pathname (if any) of the zip program.  After Configure runs,

pm_apiversion (xs_apiversion.U):
	This variable contains the version of the oldest perl
	compatible with the present perl.  (That is, pure perl modules
	written for $pm_apiversion will still work for the current
	version).  perl.c:incpush() and lib/lib.pm will automatically
	search in $sitelib for older directories across major versions
	back to pm_apiversion.  This is only useful if you have a perl
	library directory tree structured like the default one.  The
	versioned site_perl library was introduced in 5.005, so that's
	the default setting for this variable.  It's hard to imagine
	it changing before Perl6.  It is included here for symmetry
	with xs_apiveprsion -- the searching algorithms will
	(presumably) be similar.
	See the INSTALL file for how this works.

xs_apiversion (xs_apiversion.U):
	This variable contains the version of the oldest perl binary
	compatible with the present perl.  perl.c:incpush() and

	directories across major versions back to xs_apiversion.
	This is only useful if you have a perl library directory tree
	structured like the default one.
	See INSTALL for how this works.
	The versioned site_perl directory was introduced in 5.005,
	so that is the lowest possible value.
	Since this can depend on compile time options
	it is set by Configure.  Other non-default sources
	of potential incompatibility, such as multiplicity, threads,
	debugging, 64bits, sfio, etc., are not checked for currently,
	though in principle we could go snooping around in old
	Config.pm files.

	This is unique to perl.

sysman (sysman.U):
	This variable holds the place where the manual is located on this
	system. It is not the place where the user wants to put his manual

	nm extraction is wanted or not.

useopcode (Extensions.U):
	This variable holds either 'true' or 'false' to indicate

api_revision (patchlevel.U):
	The three variables, api_revision, api_version, and
	api_subversion, specify the version of the oldest perl binary
	compatible with the present perl.  In a full version string
	such as '5.6.1', api_revision is the '5'.
	Prior to 5.5.640, the format was a floating point number,
	like 5.00563.
		perl.c:incpush() and lib/lib.pm will automatically search in
	$sitelib/.. for older directories back to the limit specified
	by these api_ variables.  This is only useful if you have a
	perl library directory tree structured like the default one.
	See INSTALL for how this works.  The versioned site_perl
	directory was introduced in 5.005, so that is the lowest
	possible value.  The version list appropriate for the current
	system is determined in inc_version_list.U.
		XXX To do:  Since compatibility can depend on compile time
	options (such as bincompat, longlong, etc.) it should
	(perhaps) be set by Configure, but currently it isn't.
	Currently, we read a hard-wired value from patchlevel.h.
	Perhaps what we ought to do is take the hard-wired value from
	patchlevel.h but then modify it if the current Configure
	options warrant.  patchlevel.h then would use an #ifdef guard.

api_subversion (patchlevel.U):
	The three variables, api_revision, api_version, and
	api_subversion, specify the version of the oldest perl binary
	compatible with the present perl.  In a full version string

a1800 18
installstyle (installstyle.U):
	This variable describes the "style" of the perl installation.
	This is intended to be useful for tools that need to
	manipulate entire perl distributions.  Perl itself doesn't use
	this to find its libraries -- the library directories are
	stored directly in Config.pm.  Currently, there are only two
	styles:  "lib" and "lib/perl5".  The default library locations
	(e.g. privlib, sitelib) are either $prefix/lib or
	$prefix/lib/perl5.  The former is useful if $prefix is a
	directory dedicated to perl (e.g. /opt/perl), while the latter
	is useful if $prefix is shared by many packages, e.g. if
	$prefix=/usr/local.
		This may later be extended to include other information, so
	be careful with pattern-matching on the results.
		For compatibility with perl5.005 and earlier, the default
	setting is based on whether or not $prefix contains the string
	"perl".

pm_apiversion (xs_apiversion.U):
	This variable contains the version of the oldest perl
	compatible with the present perl.  (That is, pure perl modules
	written for $pm_apiversion will still work for the current
	version).  perl.c:incpush() and lib/lib.pm will automatically
	search in $sitelib for older directories across major versions
	back to pm_apiversion.  This is only useful if you have a perl
	library directory tree structured like the default one.  The
	versioned site_perl library was introduced in 5.005, so that's
	the default setting for this variable.  It's hard to imagine
	it changing before Perl6.  It is included here for symmetry
	with xs_apiveprsion -- the searching algorithms will
	(presumably) be similar.

	This combines revision, patchlevel, and subversion to get the
	full version number, including any possible subversions.
	This is suitable for use as a directory name, and hence is
	filesystem dependent.
a2664 22

xlibpth (libpth.U):
	This variable holds extra path (space-separated) used to find
	libraries on this platform, for example CPU-specific libraries
	(on multi-CPU platforms) may be listed here.

xs_apiversion (xs_apiversion.U):
	This variable contains the version of the oldest perl binary
	compatible with the present perl.  perl.c:incpush() and
	lib/lib.pm will automatically search in $sitearch for older
	directories across major versions back to xs_apiversion.
	This is only useful if you have a perl library directory tree
	structured like the default one.
	See INSTALL for how this works.
	The versioned site_perl directory was introduced in 5.005,
	so that is the lowest possible value.
	Since this can depend on compile time options (such as
	bincompat) it is set by Configure.  Other non-default sources
	of potential incompatibility, such as multiplicity, threads,
	debugging, 64bits, sfio, etc., are not checked for currently,
	though in principle we could go snooping around in old
	Config.pm files.

	sets this macro to use the first of gconvert, gcvt, or sprintf
	that pass sprintf-%g-like behaviour tests.  If perl is using
	long doubles, the macro uses the first of the following

	defaults for all three directory hierarchies (core, vendor, and
	site), there is no guarantee that the same style is actually
	appropriate for all those directories.  For example, $prefix
	might be /opt/perl, but $siteprefix might be /usr/local.
	(Perhaps, in retrospect, the "lib" style should never have been
	supported, but it did seem like a nice idea at the time.)

	The situation is even less clear for tools such as MakeMaker
	that can be used to install additional modules into
	non-standard places.  For example, if a user intends to install
	a module into a private directory (perhaps by setting PREFIX on
	the Makefile.PL command line), then there is no reason to
	assume that the Configure-time $installstyle setting will be
	relevant for that PREFIX.

	those which where not.  See "extensions" for the list of extensions
	actually built and available.
d3993 2
a3994 4
	This variable holds a list of all non-xs extensions built and
	installed by the package.  By default, all non-xs extensions
	distributed will be built, with the exception of platform-specific
	extensions (currently only one VMS specific extension).

sysroot (Sysroot.U):
	This variable is empty unless supplied by the Configure user.
	It can contain a path to an alternative root directory, under which
	headers and libraries for the compilation target can be found. This
	is generally used when cross-compiling using a gcc-like compiler.

a4887 31
targetdir (Cross.U):
	This variable contains a path that will be created on the target
	host using targetmkdir, and then used to copy the cross-compiled
	executables to. Defaults to '/tmp' if not set.

targetenv (Cross.U):
	If cross-compiling, this variable can be used to modify the
	environment on the target system.
	However, how and where it's used, and even if it's used at all, is
	entirely dependent on both the transport mechanism (targetrun) and
	what the target system is.  Unless the relevant documentation says
	otherwise, it is genereally not useful.

targethost (Cross.U):
	This variable contains the name of a separate host machine that
	can be used to run compiled test programs and perl tests on.
	Set to empty string if not in use.

targetmkdir (Cross.U):
	This variable contains the command used by Configure to create a
	new directory on the target host.

targetport (Cross.U):
	This variable contains the number of a network port to be used to
	connect to the host in targethost, if unset defaults to 22 for ssh.

targetsh (Cross.U):
	If cross-compiling, this variable contains the location of sh on the
	target system.
	If not, this will be the same as $sh.
