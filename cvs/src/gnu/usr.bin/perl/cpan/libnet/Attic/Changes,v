  * Simplified Makefile.PL requirements.

libnet 1.26  -- Fri May 30 2014

  * Set minimum required ExtUtils::MakeMaker version to 6.64 to ensure that all
    parameters used are supported, to save jumping through hoops to support
    earlier versions.  (This should not be a problem since ExtUtils::MakeMaker
    6.64 is easily installed into Perl 5.8.1 and above, that being the whole
    point of the new choice of minimum supported Perl version.)
  * Set minimum required Perl version to 5.8.1.  This is in line with the
    minimum requirement of the "Perl Toolchain".

    Fraser]

  * Typo fixes [David Steinbrunner; resolves CPAN RT#87681]

libnet 1.22_02 -- Thu Aug 08 2013

  * Make Net::FTP::dataconn::close() more robust [Together with changes to
    Net::FTP already made in 1.22_01, this resolves CPAN RT#37700]
  * Document scalar/list context return values from Net::Cmd::message()
  * Fix broken URL [Resolves CPAN RT#68749]
  * Fix documentation typo in Net::Netrc
  * Fix broken POD in Net::POP3
  * Improve Net::SMTP documentation of new(), auth() and message() [Resolves
    CPAN RT#36038]
  * Add proper skips to skipped tests in ftp.t
  * Import hostname.t fix from perl core commit #adeb94125a
  * Add time.t, imported from perl core commit #c85707204c
  * Add new maintainer information, with updated CPAN and GitHub links

  * Send ALLO command just before the store command
  * Avoid warnings when server do not prefix messages with codes
  * Use uppercase characters for xtext encoding
  * Catch timeout condition while doing an abort
  * Ensure REST is sent directly before command being restarted
  * [rt.cpan.org #49920] Fix URL [Leon Brocard]
  * Avoid long hang on Mac OS X when hostname is *.local by not calling gethostbyname [Father Chrysostomos]
  * Avoid infinite recursion in rmdir
  * Allow finding _netrc on machines that do not support .netrc [Ben Bimber]
