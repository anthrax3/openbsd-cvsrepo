\section{Introduction\label{Introduction}\index{Introduction}}
\begin{itemize}

\item 

Always check the return codes of system calls. Good error messages should
go to STDERR, include which program caused the problem, what the failed
system call and arguments were, and (\textbf{very important}) should contain
the standard system error message for what went wrong. Here's a simple
but sufficient example:

\begin{verbatim}
        opendir(D, $dir) or die "can't opendir $dir: $!";
\end{verbatim}

\item 

Line up your transliterations when it makes sense:

\begin{verbatim}
        tr [abc]
           [xyz];
\end{verbatim}


The above should be aligned since it includes an embedded tab.


\item 

Think about reusability. Why waste brainpower on a one-shot when you
might want to do something like it again? Consider generalizing your
code. Consider writing a module or object class. Consider making your
code run cleanly with \texttt{use strict} and \texttt{-w} (or \texttt{use warnings} in
Perl 5.6) in effect. Consider giving away your code. Consider changing
your whole world view. Consider... oh, never mind.


\item 

Be consistent.


\item 

Be nice.

\end{itemize}
\section{Links\label{Links}\index{Links}}


This link should just include one word: \textsf{Pod::LaTeX}



This link should include the text \texttt{test} even though
it refers to \texttt{Pod::LaTeX}: \textsf{test}.



Standard link: \emph{Pod::LaTeX}.



Now refer to an external section: \textsf{sec} in \emph{Pod::LaTeX}

\section{Lists\label{Lists}\index{Lists}}


Test description list with long lines

\begin{description}

Some additional para.

\begin{itemize}

\item 

Nested itemized list


\item 

Second item

\end{itemize}

\item[{some longer text than that}] \mbox{}

and again.


\item[{this text is even longer and greater than}] \textbf{40 characters}

Some more content for the item.


\item[{this is some text with \textit{something across}}] \textbf{the 40 char boundary}

This is item content.


\item[{square [ bracket in item}] \mbox{}

Square bracket content

\end{description}


And this should be an enumerated list without any cruft after the numbers or additional numbers at all.

\begin{enumerate}

\item 

item 1


\item 

item 2

\end{enumerate}
\section{Escapes\label{Escapes}\index{Escapes}}


Test some normal escapes such as $<$ (lt) and $>$ (gt) and $|$ (verbar) and
\texttt{\~{}} (tilde) and \& (amp) as well as $<$ (Esc lt) and $|$ (Esc
verbar) and \textfractionsolidus{} (Esc sol) and $>$ (Esc gt) and \& (Esc amp)
and " (Esc quot) and even $\alpha$ (Esc alpha).

\section{For blocks\label{For_blocks}\index{For blocks}}
  Some latex code \textbf{here}.



Some text that should appear.



Some more text that should appear

Some latex in a \textsf{begin block}
