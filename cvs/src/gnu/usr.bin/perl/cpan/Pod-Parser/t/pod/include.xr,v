@    This file tries to demonstrate a simple =include directive for pods. It
    is used as follows:

       =include filename

    where "filename" is expected to be an absolute pathname, or else reside
    be relative to the directory in which the current processed podfile
    resides, or be relative to the current directory.

    Lets try it out with the file "included.t" shall we.

    ***THIS TEXT IS IMMEDIATELY BEFORE THE INCLUDE***

###### begin =include included.t #####
    This is the text of the included file named "included.t". It should
    appear in the final pod document from pod2xxx

###### end =include included.t #####
    ***THIS TEXT IS IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE INCLUDE***

    So how did we do???
