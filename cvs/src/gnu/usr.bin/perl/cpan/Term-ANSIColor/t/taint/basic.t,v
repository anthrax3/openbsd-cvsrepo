# Check that Term::ANSIColor untaints generated constants.
#
# It's possible that the name of the constant function that we're calling
# could be tained (such as by loading the name of the constant function from
# an environment variable).  Term::ANSIColor does the work to untaint it; be
# sure that the taint flag is properly cleared.
