=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Test::Harness;

  runtests(@@test_files);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Although, for historical reasons, the L<Test::Harness> distribution
takes its name from this module it now exists only to provide
L<TAP::Harness> with an interface that is somewhat backwards compatible
with L<Test::Harness> 2.xx. If you're writing new code consider using
L<TAP::Harness> directly instead.

Emulation is provided for C<runtests> and C<execute_tests> but the
pluggable 'Straps' interface that previous versions of L<Test::Harness>
supported is not reproduced here. Straps is now available as a stand
alone module: L<Test::Harness::Straps>.

See L<TAP::Parser>, L<TAP::Harness> for the main documentation for this
distribution.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

The following functions are available.

=head2 runtests( @@test_files )

This runs all the given I<@@test_files> and divines whether they passed
or failed based on their output to STDOUT (details above).  It prints
out each individual test which failed along with a summary report and
a how long it all took.

It returns true if everything was ok.  Otherwise it will C<die()> with
one of the messages in the DIAGNOSTICS section.

=head2 execute_tests( tests => \@@test_files, out => \*FH )

Runs all the given C<@@test_files> (just like C<runtests()>) but
doesn't generate the final report.  During testing, progress
information will be written to the currently selected output
filehandle (usually C<STDOUT>), or to the filehandle given by the
C<out> parameter.  The I<out> is optional.

Returns a list of two values, C<$total> and C<$failed>, describing the
results.  C<$total> is a hash ref summary of all the tests run.  Its
keys and values are this:

    bonus           Number of individual todo tests unexpectedly passed
    max             Number of individual tests ran
    ok              Number of individual tests passed
    sub_skipped     Number of individual tests skipped
    todo            Number of individual todo tests

    files           Number of test files ran
    good            Number of test files passed
    bad             Number of test files failed
    tests           Number of test files originally given
    skipped         Number of test files skipped

If C<< $total->{bad} == 0 >> and C<< $total->{max} > 0 >>, you've
got a successful test.

C<$failed> is a hash ref of all the test scripts that failed.  Each key
is the name of a test script, each value is another hash representing
how that script failed.  Its keys are these:

    name        Name of the test which failed
    estat       Script's exit value
    wstat       Script's wait status
    max         Number of individual tests
    failed      Number which failed
    canon       List of tests which failed (as string).

C<$failed> should be empty if everything passed.

__END__

=head1 EXPORT

C<&runtests> is exported by C<Test::Harness> by default.

C<&execute_tests>, C<$verbose>, C<$switches> and C<$debug> are
exported upon request.

=head1 ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES THAT TAP::HARNESS::COMPATIBLE SETS

C<Test::Harness> sets these before executing the individual tests.

=over 4

=item C<HARNESS_ACTIVE>

This is set to a true value.  It allows the tests to determine if they
are being executed through the harness or by any other means.

=item C<HARNESS_VERSION>

This is the version of C<Test::Harness>.

=back

=head1 ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES THAT AFFECT TEST::HARNESS

=over 4

=item C<HARNESS_PERL_SWITCHES>

Setting this adds perl command line switches to each test file run.

For example, C<HARNESS_PERL_SWITCHES=-T> will turn on taint mode.
C<HARNESS_PERL_SWITCHES=-MDevel::Cover> will run C<Devel::Cover> for
each test.

C<-w> is always set.  You can turn this off in the test with C<BEGIN {
$^W = 0 }>.

=item C<HARNESS_TIMER>

Setting this to true will make the harness display the number of
milliseconds each test took.  You can also use F<prove>'s C<--timer>
switch.

=item C<HARNESS_VERBOSE>

If true, C<Test::Harness> will output the verbose results of running
its tests.  Setting C<$Test::Harness::verbose> will override this,
or you can use the C<-v> switch in the F<prove> utility.

=item C<HARNESS_OPTIONS>

Provide additional options to the harness. Currently supported options are:

=over

=item C<< j<n> >>

Run <n> (default 9) parallel jobs.

=item C<< c >>

Try to color output. See L<TAP::Formatter::Base/"new">.

=item C<< a<file.tgz> >>

Will use L<TAP::Harness::Archive> as the harness class, and save the TAP to
C<file.tgz>

=item C<< fPackage-With-Dashes >>

Set the formatter_class of the harness being run. Since the C<HARNESS_OPTIONS>
is seperated by C<:>, we use C<-> instead.

=back

Multiple options may be separated by colons:

    HARNESS_OPTIONS=j9:c make test

=item C<HARNESS_SUBCLASS>

Specifies a TAP::Harness subclass to be used in place of TAP::Harness.

=item C<HARNESS_SUMMARY_COLOR_SUCCESS>

=head1 Taint Mode

Normally when a Perl program is run in taint mode the contents of the
C<PERL5LIB> environment variable do not appear in C<@@INC>.

Because C<PERL5LIB> is often used during testing to add build
directories to C<@@INC> C<Test::Harness> passes the names of any
directories found in C<PERL5LIB> as -I switches. The net effect of this
is that C<PERL5LIB> is honoured even in taint mode.

module is based) has this attribution:

    Either Tim Bunce or Andreas Koenig, we don't know. What we know for
    sure is, that it was inspired by Larry Wall's F<TEST> script that came
    with perl distributions for ages. Numerous anonymous contributors
    exist.  Andreas Koenig held the torch for many years, and then
    Michael G Schwern.

@Patch perl CVE-2016-1238

The problem relates to Perl 5 ("perl") loading modules from the
includes directory array ("@@INC") in which the last element is the
current directory (".").  That means that, when "perl" wants to
load a module (during first compilation or during lazy loading of
a module in run-time), perl will look for the module in the current
directory at the end, since '.' is the last include directory in
its array of include directories to seek. The issue is with requiring
libraries that are in "." but are not otherwise installed.

The major problem with this behavior is that it unexpectedly puts
a user at risk whenever they execute any Perl scripts from a directory
that is writable by other accounts on the system. For instance, if
a user is logged in as root and changes directory into /tmp or an
account's home directory, it is possible to now run any shell
commands that are written in C, Python or Ruby without fear.

The same isn't true for any shell commands that are written in Perl,
since a significant proportion of Perl scripts will execute code
in the current working directory whenever they are run. For example,
if a user on a shared system creates the file /tmp/Pod/Perldoc/Toterm.pm,
and then I log in as root, change directory to /tmp, and run "perldoc
perlrun", it will execute the code they have placed in the file.
