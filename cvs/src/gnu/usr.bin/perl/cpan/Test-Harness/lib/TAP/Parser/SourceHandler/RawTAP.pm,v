@package TAP::Parser::SourceHandler::RawTAP;

use strict;
use warnings;

use TAP::Parser::IteratorFactory ();
use TAP::Parser::Iterator::Array ();

use base 'TAP::Parser::SourceHandler';

TAP::Parser::IteratorFactory->register_handler(__PACKAGE__);

=head1 NAME

TAP::Parser::SourceHandler::RawTAP - Stream output from raw TAP in a scalar/array ref.

=head1 VERSION

Version 3.36

=cut

our $VERSION = '3.36_01';

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use TAP::Parser::Source;
  use TAP::Parser::SourceHandler::RawTAP;

  my $source = TAP::Parser::Source->new->raw( \"1..1\nok 1\n" );
  $source->assemble_meta;

  my $class = 'TAP::Parser::SourceHandler::RawTAP';
  my $vote  = $class->can_handle( $source );
  my $iter  = $class->make_iterator( $source );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a I<raw TAP output> L<TAP::Parser::SourceHandler> - it has 2 jobs:

1. Figure out if the L<TAP::Parser::Source> it's given is raw TAP output
(L</can_handle>).

2. Creates an iterator for raw TAP output (L</make_iterator>).

Unless you're writing a plugin or subclassing L<TAP::Parser>, you probably
won't need to use this module directly.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 Class Methods

=head3 C<can_handle>

  my $vote = $class->can_handle( $source );

Only votes if $source is an array, or a scalar with newlines.  Casts the
following votes:

  0.9  if it's a scalar with '..' in it
  0.7  if it's a scalar with 'ok' in it
  0.3  if it's just a scalar with newlines
  0.5  if it's an array

=cut

sub can_handle {
    my ( $class, $src ) = @@_;
    my $meta = $src->meta;

    return 0 if $meta->{file};
    if ( $meta->{is_scalar} ) {
        return 0 unless $meta->{has_newlines};
        return 0.9 if ${ $src->raw } =~ /\d\.\.\d/;
        return 0.7 if ${ $src->raw } =~ /ok/;
        return 0.3;
    }
    elsif ( $meta->{is_array} ) {
        return 0.5;
    }
    return 0;
}

=head3 C<make_iterator>

  my $iterator = $class->make_iterator( $source );

Returns a new L<TAP::Parser::Iterator::Array> for the source.
C<$source-E<gt>raw> must be an array ref, or a scalar ref.

C<croak>s on error.

=cut

sub make_iterator {
    my ( $class, $src ) = @@_;
    my $meta = $src->meta;

    my $tap_array;
    if ( $meta->{is_scalar} ) {
        $tap_array = [ split "\n" => ${ $src->raw } ];
    }
    elsif ( $meta->{is_array} ) {
        $tap_array = $src->raw;
    }

    $class->_croak('No raw TAP found in $source->raw')
      unless scalar $tap_array;

    return TAP::Parser::Iterator::Array->new($tap_array);
}

@Patch perl CVE-2016-1238

The problem relates to Perl 5 ("perl") loading modules from the
includes directory array ("@@INC") in which the last element is the
current directory (".").  That means that, when "perl" wants to
load a module (during first compilation or during lazy loading of
a module in run-time), perl will look for the module in the current
directory at the end, since '.' is the last include directory in
its array of include directories to seek. The issue is with requiring
libraries that are in "." but are not otherwise installed.

The major problem with this behavior is that it unexpectedly puts
a user at risk whenever they execute any Perl scripts from a directory
that is writable by other accounts on the system. For instance, if
a user is logged in as root and changes directory into /tmp or an
account's home directory, it is possible to now run any shell
commands that are written in C, Python or Ruby without fear.

The same isn't true for any shell commands that are written in Perl,
since a significant proportion of Perl scripts will execute code
in the current working directory whenever they are run. For example,
if a user on a shared system creates the file /tmp/Pod/Perldoc/Toterm.pm,
and then I log in as root, change directory to /tmp, and run "perldoc
perlrun", it will execute the code they have placed in the file.
