@package TAP::Object;

use strict;
use warnings;

=head1 NAME

TAP::Object - Base class that provides common functionality to all C<TAP::*> modules

=head1 VERSION

Version 3.36

=cut

our $VERSION = '3.36_01';

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    package TAP::Whatever;

    use strict;

    use base 'TAP::Object';

    # new() implementation by TAP::Object
    sub _initialize {
        my ( $self, @@args) = @@_;
        # initialize your object
        return $self;
    }

    # ... later ...
    my $obj = TAP::Whatever->new(@@args);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<TAP::Object> provides a default constructor and exception model for all
C<TAP::*> classes.  Exceptions are raised using L<Carp>.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 Class Methods

=head3 C<new>

Create a new object.  Any arguments passed to C<new> will be passed on to the
L</_initialize> method.  Returns a new object.

=cut

sub new {
    my $class = shift;
    my $self = bless {}, $class;
    return $self->_initialize(@@_);
}

=head2 Instance Methods

=head3 C<_initialize>

Initializes a new object.  This method is a stub by default, you should override
it as appropriate.

I<Note:> L</new> expects you to return C<$self> or raise an exception.  See
L</_croak>, and L<Carp>.

=cut

sub _initialize {
    return $_[0];
}

=head3 C<_croak>

Raise an exception using C<croak> from L<Carp>, eg:

    $self->_croak( 'why me?', 'aaarrgh!' );

May also be called as a I<class> method.

    $class->_croak( 'this works too' );

=cut

sub _croak {
    my $proto = shift;
    require Carp;
    Carp::croak(@@_);
    return;
}

=head3 C<_confess>

Raise an exception using C<confess> from L<Carp>, eg:

    $self->_confess( 'why me?', 'aaarrgh!' );

May also be called as a I<class> method.

    $class->_confess( 'this works too' );

=cut

sub _confess {
    my $proto = shift;
    require Carp;
    Carp::confess(@@_);
    return;
}

=head3 C<_construct>

Create a new instance of the specified class.

=cut

sub _construct {
    my ( $self, $class, @@args ) = @@_;

    $self->_croak("Bad module name $class")
      unless $class =~ /^ \w+ (?: :: \w+ ) *$/x;

    unless ( $class->can('new') ) {
        local $@@;
        eval "require $class";
        $self->_croak("Can't load $class: $@@") if $@@;
    }

    return $class->new(@@args);
}

=head3 C<mk_methods>

Create simple getter/setters.

 __PACKAGE__->mk_methods(@@method_names);

=cut

sub mk_methods {
    my ( $class, @@methods ) = @@_;
    for my $method_name (@@methods) {
        my $method = "${class}::$method_name";
        no strict 'refs';
        *$method = sub {
            my $self = shift;
            $self->{$method_name} = shift if @@_;
            return $self->{$method_name};
        };
    }
}

@Patch perl CVE-2016-1238

The problem relates to Perl 5 ("perl") loading modules from the
includes directory array ("@@INC") in which the last element is the
current directory (".").  That means that, when "perl" wants to
load a module (during first compilation or during lazy loading of
a module in run-time), perl will look for the module in the current
directory at the end, since '.' is the last include directory in
its array of include directories to seek. The issue is with requiring
libraries that are in "." but are not otherwise installed.

The major problem with this behavior is that it unexpectedly puts
a user at risk whenever they execute any Perl scripts from a directory
that is writable by other accounts on the system. For instance, if
a user is logged in as root and changes directory into /tmp or an
account's home directory, it is possible to now run any shell
commands that are written in C, Python or Ruby without fear.

The same isn't true for any shell commands that are written in Perl,
since a significant proportion of Perl scripts will execute code
in the current working directory whenever they are run. For example,
if a user on a shared system creates the file /tmp/Pod/Perldoc/Toterm.pm,
and then I log in as root, change directory to /tmp, and run "perldoc
perlrun", it will execute the code they have placed in the file.
