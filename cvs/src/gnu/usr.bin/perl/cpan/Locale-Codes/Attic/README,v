			Locale-Codes Distribution
				v2.07

For changes in this release, please see the ChangeLog file.

This distribution contains four Perl modules which can be used to process
ISO codes for identifying languages, countries, scripts,
and currencies & funds.

    Locale::Language
	Two letter codes for language identification (ISO 639).
	For example, 'en' is the code for 'English'.

    Locale::Country
	Codes for country identification (ISO 3166). This module
	supports the three different code sets defined by the
	standard: alpha-2, alpha-3, and numeric codes.
	For example, 'bo' is the code for 'Bolivia'.

    Locale::Currency
	Three letter codes for currency and fund identification (ISO 4217).
	For example, 'sek' is the code for 'Swedish Krona'.

    Locale::Script
	Codes for script identification (ISO 15924). This module supports
	the three different code sets defined by the standard:
	alpha-2, alpha-3, and numeric codes.

To install these modules, you should just have to run the following:

	% perl Makefile.PL
	% make
	% make test
	% make install

The modules are documented using pod. When you "make install", you
will get four man-pages: Locale::Language, Locale::Country,
Locale::Currency, Locale::Script.

The first version of Locale::Currency was written by Michael Hennecke,
with modifications for inclusion by me. Kudos to Michael.

Please let me know if you experience any problems with these modules,
or have any ideas for additions.
