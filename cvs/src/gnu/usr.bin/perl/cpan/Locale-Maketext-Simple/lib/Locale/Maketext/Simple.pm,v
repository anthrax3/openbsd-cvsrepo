@Patch perl CVE-2016-1238

The problem relates to Perl 5 ("perl") loading modules from the
includes directory array ("@@INC") in which the last element is the
current directory (".").  That means that, when "perl" wants to
load a module (during first compilation or during lazy loading of
a module in run-time), perl will look for the module in the current
directory at the end, since '.' is the last include directory in
its array of include directories to seek. The issue is with requiring
libraries that are in "." but are not otherwise installed.

The major problem with this behavior is that it unexpectedly puts
a user at risk whenever they execute any Perl scripts from a directory
that is writable by other accounts on the system. For instance, if
a user is logged in as root and changes directory into /tmp or an
account's home directory, it is possible to now run any shell
commands that are written in C, Python or Ruby without fear.

The same isn't true for any shell commands that are written in Perl,
since a significant proportion of Perl scripts will execute code
in the current working directory whenever they are run. For example,
if a user on a shared system creates the file /tmp/Pod/Perldoc/Toterm.pm,
and then I log in as root, change directory to /tmp, and run "perldoc
perlrun", it will execute the code they have placed in the file.

$Locale::Maketext::Simple::VERSION = '0.21_01';

use strict;
use 5.005;

=head1 NAME

Locale::Maketext::Simple - Simple interface to Locale::Maketext::Lexicon

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.18 of Locale::Maketext::Simple,
released Septermber 8, 2006.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Minimal setup (looks for F<auto/Foo/*.po> and F<auto/Foo/*.mo>):

    package Foo;
    use Locale::Maketext::Simple;	# exports 'loc'
    loc_lang('fr');			# set language to French
    sub hello {
	print loc("Hello, [_1]!", "World");
    }

More sophisticated example:

    package Foo::Bar;
    use Locale::Maketext::Simple (
	Class	    => 'Foo',	    # search in auto/Foo/
	Style	    => 'gettext',   # %1 instead of [_1]
	Export	    => 'maketext',  # maketext() instead of loc()
	Subclass    => 'L10N',	    # Foo::L10N instead of Foo::I18N
	Decode	    => 1,	    # decode entries to unicode-strings
	Encoding    => 'locale',    # but encode lexicons in current locale
				    # (needs Locale::Maketext::Lexicon 0.36)
    );
    sub japh {
	print maketext("Just another %1 hacker", "Perl");
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is a simple wrapper around B<Locale::Maketext::Lexicon>,
designed to alleviate the need of creating I<Language Classes> for
module authors.

The language used is chosen from the loc_lang call. If a lookup is not
possible, the i-default language will be used. If the lookup is not in the
i-default language, then the key will be returned.

If B<Locale::Maketext::Lexicon> is not present, it implements a
minimal localization function by simply interpolating C<[_1]> with
the first argument, C<[_2]> with the second, etc.  Interpolated
function like C<[quant,_1]> are treated as C<[_1]>, with the sole
exception of C<[tense,_1,X]>, which will append C<ing> to C<_1> when
X is C<present>, or appending C<ed> to <_1> otherwise.

=head1 OPTIONS

All options are passed either via the C<use> statement, or via an
explicit C<import>.

=head2 Class

By default, B<Locale::Maketext::Simple> draws its source from the
calling package's F<auto/> directory; you can override this behaviour
by explicitly specifying another package as C<Class>.

=head2 Path

If your PO and MO files are under a path elsewhere than C<auto/>,
you may specify it using the C<Path> option.

=head2 Style

By default, this module uses the C<maketext> style of C<[_1]> and
C<[quant,_1]> for interpolation.  Alternatively, you can specify the
C<gettext> style, which uses C<%1> and C<%quant(%1)> for interpolation.

This option is case-insensitive.

=head2 Export

By default, this module exports a single function, C<loc>, into its
caller's namespace.  You can set it to another name, or set it to
an empty string to disable exporting.

=head2 Subclass

By default, this module creates an C<::I18N> subclass under the
caller's package (or the package specified by C<Class>), and stores
lexicon data in its subclasses.  You can assign a name other than
C<I18N> via this option.

=head2 Decode

If set to a true value, source entries will be converted into
utf8-strings (available in Perl 5.6.1 or later).  This feature
needs the B<Encode> or B<Encode::compat> module.

=head2 Encoding

Specifies an encoding to store lexicon entries, instead of
utf8-strings.  If set to C<locale>, the encoding from the current
locale setting is used.  Implies a true value for C<Decode>.
