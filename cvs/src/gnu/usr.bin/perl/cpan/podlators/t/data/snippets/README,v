@Fix merge issues, remove excess files - match perl-5.24.1 dist

text
@The files in this directory are used by the test suite to exercise various
behavior of Pod::Man or Pod::Text.  They use a pseudo-ini-file syntax with
free-form sections, normally an input and an output section and possibly
others.

Sections start with the section type in [].  The contents are normally
just free-form.  The exception is an [options] section, where the contents
are key/value pairs, where the key is separated from the value with
whitespace.

Valid sections are:

    [name]
    The name of this test for status reporting
    
    [options]
    key value
    key value
    
    [input]
    POD input source.
    
    [output]
    The results of running some formatter on the input.
    
    [errors]
    Errors reported to standard error when running some formatter on the
    input.
    
    [exception]
    The text of an exception (with the file and line number information
    stripped) thrown by running some formatter on the input.

Files are organized into subdirectories named after the formatter, namely
man (Pod::Man), text (Pod::Text), color (Pod::Text::Color), overstrike
(Pod::Text::Overstrike), and termcap (Pod::Text::Termcap).
