=head1 NAME

autodie::skip - Skip a package when throwing autodie exceptions

=head1 SYNPOSIS

    use parent qw(autodie::skip);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This dummy class exists to signal that the class inheriting it should
be skipped when reporting exceptions from autodie.  This is useful
for utility classes like L<Path::Tiny> that wish to report the location
of where they were called on failure.

If your class has a better way of doing roles, then you should not
load this class and instead simply say that your class I<DOES>
C<autodie::skip> instead.
