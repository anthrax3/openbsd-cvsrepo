@Revision history for Perl extension Text::Soundex.

3.02  Sun Feb 02 02:54:00 EST 2003 <mark@@mielke.cc>

The U8 type was over-used in 3.00 and 3.01. Now, "U8 *" is used only as a
pointer into the UTF-8 string. Also, unicode now works properly on
Perl 5.6.x as the utf8_to_uv() function is used instead of utf8n_to_uvchr()
when compiled under a version of Perl earlier than 5.8.0.

3.01  Sun Jan 26 16:30:00 EST 2003 <mark@@mielke.cc>

A bug with non-UTF 8 strings that contain non-ASCII alphabetic characters
was fixed. The soundex_unicode() and soundex_nara_unicode() wrapper
routines were included and the documentation refers the user to the
excellent Text::Unidecode module to perform soundex encodings using
unicode strings. The Perl versions of the routines have been further
optimized, and correct a border case involving non-alphabetic characters
at the beginning of the string.

3.00  Sun Jan 26 04:08:00 EST 2003 <mark@@mielke.cc>

Updated documentation, simplified the Perl interface, and updated
the XS code to be faster, and to properly work with UTF-8 strings.
UNICODE characters outside the ASCII range (0x00 - 0x7F) are
considered to be non-alphabetic for the purposes of the soundex
algorithms.

2.10  Sun Feb 15 15:29:38 EST 1998 <mark@@mielke.cc>

I've put in a version of my XS code and fully integrated it with the
existing 100% perl mechanism. The change should be virtually transparent
to the user. XS code is approx 7.5 times faster.
                                                           - Mark Mielke

2.00  Thu Jan  1 16:22:11 1998 <mike@@stok.co.uk>

Incorporated Mark Mielke's rewritten version of the main soundex routine 
and made the test.pl file simpler.

The module is going to be removed from the core distribution of perl, and will
now warn (under warnings) if loaded from its installed-to-core location.
