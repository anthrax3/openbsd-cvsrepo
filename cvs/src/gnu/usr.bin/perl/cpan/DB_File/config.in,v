@# Filename:	config.in
#
# written by Paul Marquess <Paul.Marquess@@btinternet.com>
# last modified 9th Sept 1997
# version 1.55

# 1. Where is the file db.h?
#
#    Change the path below to point to the directory where db.h is
#    installed on your system.

INCLUDE	= /usr/local/BerkeleyDB/include
#INCLUDE	= /usr/local/include
#INCLUDE	= /usr/include

# 2. Where is libdb?
#
#    Change the path below to point to the directory where libdb is
#    installed on your system.

LIB	= /usr/local/BerkeleyDB/lib
#LIB	= /usr/local/lib
#LIB	= /usr/lib

# 3. What version of Berkely DB have you got?
#
#    If you have version 2.0 or greater, you can skip this question.
#
#    If you have Berkeley DB 1.78 or greater you shouldn't have to
#    change the definitions for PREFIX and HASH below.
#
#    For older versions of Berkeley DB change both PREFIX and HASH to int.
#    Version 1.71, 1.72 and 1.73 are known to need this change.
#
#    If you don't know what version you have have a look in the file db.h. 
#
#    Search for the string "DB_VERSION_MAJOR". If it is present, you
#    have Berkeley DB version 2 (or greater).
#
#    If that didn't work, find the definition of the BTREEINFO typedef.
#    Check the return type from the prefix element. It should look like
#    this in an older copy of db.h:
#
#        int      (*prefix)      __P((const DBT *, const DBT *));  
#
#    and like this in a more recent copy:
#
#        size_t  (*prefix)       /* prefix function */
#            __P((const DBT *, const DBT *));
#
#    Change the definition of PREFIX, below, to reflect the return type
#    of the prefix function in your db.h.
#
#    Now find the definition of the HASHINFO typedef. Check the return
#    type of the hash element. Older versions look like this:
#
#        int      (*hash) __P((const void *, size_t));      
#
#    newer like this:
#
#        u_int32_t               /* hash function */
#                (*hash) __P((const void *, size_t));
#
#    Change the definition of HASH, below, to reflect the return type of
#    the hash function in your db.h.
#

PREFIX	=	size_t
HASH	=	u_int32_t

# 4. Is the library called libdb?
#
#    If you have copies of both 1.x and 2.x Berkeley DB installed on
#    your system it can sometimes be tricky to make sure you are using
#    the correct one. Renaming one (or creating a symbolic link) to
#    include the version number of the library can help.
#
#    For example, if you have both Berkeley DB 2.3.12 and 1.85 on your
#    system and you want to use the Berkeley DB version 2 library you
#    could rename the version 2 library from libdb.a to libdb-2.3.12.a and
#    change the DBNAME line below to look like this:
#
#        DBNAME = -ldb-2.3.12
#
#    That will ensure you are linking the correct version of the DB
#    library.
#
#    Note: If you are building this module with Win32, -llibdb will be
#    used by default.
#
#    If you have changed the name of the library, uncomment the line
#    below (by removing the leading #) and edit the line to use the name
#    you have picked.
 
#DBNAME = -ldb-2.4.10

# end of file config.in
