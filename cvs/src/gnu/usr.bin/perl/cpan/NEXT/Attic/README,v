==============================================================================


NAME

    NEXT - Pseudo class for method redispatch


DESCRIPTION

    NEXT.pm adds a pseudoclass named C<NEXT> to any program that
    uses it. If a method C<m> calls C<$self->NEXT::m()>, the call to
    C<m> is redispatched as if the calling method had not originally
    been found.

    In other words, a call to C<$self->NEXT::m()> resumes the
    depth-first, left-to-right search of parent classes that
    resulted in the original call to C<m>.

    Note that this is not the same thing as C<$self->SUPER::m()>, which
    begins a new dispatch that is restricted to searching the ancestors
    of the current class. C<$self->NEXT::m()> can backtrack past
    the current class -- to look for a suitable method in other
    ancestors of C<$self> -- whereas C<$self->SUPER::m()> cannot.

    An particularly interesting use of redispatch is in
    C<AUTOLOAD>'ed methods. If such a method determines that it is
    not able to handle a particular call, it may choose to
    redispatch that call, in the hope that some other C<AUTOLOAD>
    (above it, or to its left) might do better.

    The module also allows you to specify that multiply inherited
    methods should only be redispatched once, and what should
    happen if no redispatch is possible.
