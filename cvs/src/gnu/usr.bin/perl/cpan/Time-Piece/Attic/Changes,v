1.15
    - Skip a test on Win32 that there's just no way of passing
    - Document the above failure

1.14
	- rework add_months() to not rely on strptime being able to parse illegal
	  dates (Gisle Aas).
        - Various win32 TZ fixes from p5p core perl version

1.13
    - More QNX fixes (kraai@@ftbfs.org)
    - Restore freebsd copyright on strptime.
    - Added add_months and add_years methods.

    - Skip %V test on Win32

1.10
    - Number of bug fixes from RT
    - (maintenance by Ricardo SIGNES)
    - avoid warning in _mktime (bug #19677)

1.09
    - (patches from Ricardo SIGNES)
    - Tests largely moved to Test::More (from Test.pm)
    - Time::Piece should now be safely subclassable

1.20
    - Fix for alloca broke Solaris
    - Fixed documentation buggette about strptime
    - Added ->pretty() method for Time::Seconds objects
	- Add %s support to strptime

1.19
    - Fix for alloca broke FreeBSD

1.18
    - Fix for alloca on IRIX

1.17
    - Force all to use internal strptime then everyone gets %z even OSX
      users.
    - Finally figured out the timezone test failures on Win32 and fixed
      them.

1.16
	- Implement %z for the internal implementation of strptime(). 
	  Unfortunately this doesn't get picked up everywhere, so there are no 
	  tests for it (yet - patches welcome).
	- Fix for major bug in add_months() using negative months which were 
	  multiples of 12. Also affected add_years() with negative years.
	- Fix for object creation bug in get_epochs which called new from object 
	  but that wasn't supported in the new() code.
 	- Added docs about the weakness of using epoch seconds internally and
	  suggested alternatives.
	- Removed useless "use UNIVERSAL qw(isa)" line.
	- Fix for installing over core perl version.
