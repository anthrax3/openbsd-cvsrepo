# ABSTRACT: a set of distribution prerequisites by phase and type

=pod

=encoding UTF-8

=head1 NAME

CPAN::Meta::Prereqs - a set of distribution prerequisites by phase and type

=head1 VERSION

version 2.150005

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A CPAN::Meta::Prereqs object represents the prerequisites for a CPAN
distribution or one of its optional features.  Each set of prereqs is
organized by phase and type, as described in L<CPAN::Meta::Prereqs>.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

  my $prereq = CPAN::Meta::Prereqs->new( \%prereq_spec );

This method returns a new set of Prereqs.  The input should look like the
contents of the C<prereqs> field described in L<CPAN::Meta::Spec>, meaning
something more or less like this:

  my $prereq = CPAN::Meta::Prereqs->new({
    runtime => {
      requires => {
        'Some::Module' => '1.234',
        ...,
      },
      ...,
    },
    ...,
  });

You can also construct an empty set of prereqs with:

  my $prereqs = CPAN::Meta::Prereqs->new;

This empty set of prereqs is useful for accumulating new prereqs before finally
dumping the whole set into a structure or string.

=head2 requirements_for

  my $requirements = $prereqs->requirements_for( $phase, $type );

This method returns a L<CPAN::Meta::Requirements> object for the given
phase/type combination.  If no prerequisites are registered for that
combination, a new CPAN::Meta::Requirements object will be returned, and it may
be added to as needed.

If C<$phase> or C<$type> are undefined or otherwise invalid, an exception will
be raised.

=head2 with_merged_prereqs

  my $new_prereqs = $prereqs->with_merged_prereqs( $other_prereqs );

  my $new_prereqs = $prereqs->with_merged_prereqs( \@@other_prereqs );

This method returns a new CPAN::Meta::Prereqs objects in which all the
other prerequisites given are merged into the current set.  This is primarily
provided for combining a distribution's core prereqs with the prereqs of one of
its optional features.

The new prereqs object has no ties to the originals, and altering it further
will not alter them.

=head2 merged_requirements

    my $new_reqs = $prereqs->merged_requirements( \@@phases, \@@types );
    my $new_reqs = $prereqs->merged_requirements( \@@phases );
    my $new_reqs = $prereqs->merged_requirements();

This method joins together all requirements across a number of phases
and types into a new L<CPAN::Meta::Requirements> object.  If arguments
are omitted, it defaults to "runtime", "build" and "test" for phases
and "requires" and "recommends" for types.

=head2 as_string_hash

This method returns a hashref containing structures suitable for dumping into a
distmeta data structure.  It is made up of hashes and strings, only; there will
be no Prereqs, CPAN::Meta::Requirements, or C<version> objects inside it.

=head2 is_finalized

This method returns true if the set of prereqs has been marked "finalized," and
cannot be altered.

=head2 finalize

Calling C<finalize> on a Prereqs object will close it for further modification.
Attempting to make any changes that would actually alter the prereqs will
result in an exception being thrown.

=head2 clone

  my $cloned_prereqs = $prereqs->clone;

This method returns a Prereqs object that is identical to the original object,
but can be altered without affecting the original object.  Finalization does
not survive cloning, meaning that you may clone a finalized set of prereqs and
then modify the clone.

=head1 BUGS

Please report any bugs or feature using the CPAN Request Tracker.
Bugs can be submitted through the web interface at
L<http://rt.cpan.org/Dist/Display.html?Queue=CPAN-Meta>

When submitting a bug or request, please include a test-file or a patch to an
existing test-file that illustrates the bug or desired feature.

#pod
#pod This method returns a new CPAN::Meta::Prereqs objects in which all the
#pod other prerequisites given are merged into the current set.  This is primarily
#pod provided for combining a distribution's core prereqs with the prereqs of one of
#pod its optional features.
#pod
#pod The new prereqs object has no ties to the originals, and altering it further
#pod will not alter them.

#pod
#pod This method joins together all requirements across a number of phases
#pod and types into a new L<CPAN::Meta::Requirements> object.  If arguments
#pod are omitted, it defaults to "runtime", "build" and "test" for phases
#pod and "requires" and "recommends" for types.

#pod =method as_string_hash
#pod
#pod This method returns a hashref containing structures suitable for dumping into a
#pod distmeta data structure.  It is made up of hashes and strings, only; there will
#pod be no Prereqs, CPAN::Meta::Requirements, or C<version> objects inside it.

#pod Calling C<finalize> on a Prereqs object will close it for further modification.

#pod
#pod   my $cloned_prereqs = $prereqs->clone;
#pod
#pod This method returns a Prereqs object that is identical to the original object,
#pod but can be altered without affecting the original object.  Finalization does
#pod not survive cloning, meaning that you may clone a finalized set of prereqs and
#pod then modify the clone.
