=head1 NAME

ExtUtils::MM_Win95 - method to customize MakeMaker for Win9X

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  You should not be using this module directly.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a subclass of ExtUtils::MM_Win32 containing changes necessary
to get MakeMaker playing nice with command.com and other Win9Xisms.

=head2 Overridden methods

Most of these make up for limitations in the Win9x/nmake command shell.
Mostly its lack of &&.

=item xs_c

The && problem.

=cut

sub xs_c {
    my($self) = shift;
    return '' unless $self->needs_linking();
    '
.xs.c:
	$(XSUBPPRUN) $(XSPROTOARG) $(XSUBPPARGS) $*.xs > $*.c
	'
}


=item xs_cpp

The && problem

=cut

sub xs_cpp {
    my($self) = shift;
    return '' unless $self->needs_linking();
    '
.xs.cpp:
	$(XSUBPPRUN) $(XSPROTOARG) $(XSUBPPARGS) $*.xs > $*.cpp
	';
}

=item xs_o

The && problem.

=cut

sub xs_o {
    my($self) = shift;
    return '' unless $self->needs_linking();
    '
.xs$(OBJ_EXT):
	$(XSUBPPRUN) $(XSPROTOARG) $(XSUBPPARGS) $*.xs > $*.c
	$(CCCMD) $(CCCDLFLAGS) -I$(PERL_INC) $(DEFINE) $*.c
	';
}


=item max_exec_len

Win98 chokes on things like Encode if we set the max length to nmake's max
of 2K.  So we go for a more conservative value of 1K.

=cut

sub max_exec_len {
    my $self = shift;

    return $self->{_MAX_EXEC_LEN} ||= 1024;
}


=item os_flavor

Win95 and Win98 and WinME are collectively Win9x and Win32

=cut

sub os_flavor {
    my $self = shift;
    return ($self->SUPER::os_flavor, 'Win9x');
}

@Patch perl CVE-2016-1238

The problem relates to Perl 5 ("perl") loading modules from the
includes directory array ("@@INC") in which the last element is the
current directory (".").  That means that, when "perl" wants to
load a module (during first compilation or during lazy loading of
a module in run-time), perl will look for the module in the current
directory at the end, since '.' is the last include directory in
its array of include directories to seek. The issue is with requiring
libraries that are in "." but are not otherwise installed.

The major problem with this behavior is that it unexpectedly puts
a user at risk whenever they execute any Perl scripts from a directory
that is writable by other accounts on the system. For instance, if
a user is logged in as root and changes directory into /tmp or an
account's home directory, it is possible to now run any shell
commands that are written in C, Python or Ruby without fear.

The same isn't true for any shell commands that are written in Perl,
since a significant proportion of Perl scripts will execute code
in the current working directory whenever they are run. For example,
if a user on a shared system creates the file /tmp/Pod/Perldoc/Toterm.pm,
and then I log in as root, change directory to /tmp, and run "perldoc
perlrun", it will execute the code they have placed in the file.
