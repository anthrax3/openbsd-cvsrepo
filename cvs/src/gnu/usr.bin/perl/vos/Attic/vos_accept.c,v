/* This short program soaks up the call to "accept" and
   transfers it to "_accept".  This is necessary because the VOS
   C compilers treat "accept" as a keyword unless the -Xc
   (strict ANSI option) has been specified.  This program must
   be compiled with -Xc.  Because "accept" is a keyword, the VOS
   OS TCP/IP product has renamed the usual TCP/IP "accept"
   function to "_accept".  */
