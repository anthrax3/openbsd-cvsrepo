 *	Since this can depend on compile time options (such as
 *	bincompat) it is set by Configure.  Other non-default sources
 *	of potential incompatibility, such as multiplicity, threads,
 *	debugging, 64bits, sfio, etc., are not checked for currently,

/* PERL_PM_APIVERSION:
 *	This variable contains the version of the oldest perl
 *	compatible with the present perl.  (That is, pure perl modules
 *	written for pm_apiversion will still work for the current
 *	version).  perl.c:incpush() and lib/lib.pm will automatically
 *	search in $sitelib for older directories across major versions
 *	back to pm_apiversion.  This is only useful if you have a perl
 *	library directory tree structured like the default one.  The
 *	versioned site_perl library was introduced in 5.005, so that's
 *	the default setting for this variable.  It's hard to imagine
 *	it changing before Perl6.  It is included here for symmetry
 *	with xs_apiveprsion -- the searching algorithms will
 *	(presumably) be similar.
 *	See the INSTALL file for how this works.
