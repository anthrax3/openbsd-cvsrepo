=head1 NAME

parent - Establish an ISA relationship with base classes at compile time

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    package Baz;
    use parent qw(Foo Bar);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Allows you to both load one or more modules, while setting up inheritance from
those modules at the same time.  Mostly similar in effect to

    package Baz;
    BEGIN {
        require Foo;
        require Bar;
        push @@ISA, qw(Foo Bar);
    }

By default, every base class needs to live in a file of its own.
If you want to have a subclass and its parent class in the same file, you
can tell C<parent> not to load any modules by using the C<-norequire> switch:

  package Foo;
  sub exclaim { "I CAN HAS PERL" }

  package DoesNotLoadFooBar;
  use parent -norequire, 'Foo', 'Bar';
  # will not go looking for Foo.pm or Bar.pm

This is equivalent to the following code:

  package Foo;
  sub exclaim { "I CAN HAS PERL" }

  package DoesNotLoadFooBar;
  push @@DoesNotLoadFooBar::ISA, 'Foo';

This is also helpful for the case where a package lives within
a differently named file:

  package MyHash;
  use Tie::Hash;
  use parent -norequire, 'Tie::StdHash';

This is equivalent to the following code:

  package MyHash;
  require Tie::Hash;
  push @@ISA, 'Tie::StdHash';

If you want to load a subclass from a file that C<require> would
not consider an eligible filename (that is, it does not end in
either C<.pm> or C<.pmc>), use the following code:

  package MySecondPlugin;
  require './plugins/custom.plugin'; # contains Plugin::Custom
  use parent -norequire, 'Plugin::Custom';

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

=over 4

=item Class 'Foo' tried to inherit from itself

Attempting to inherit from yourself generates a warning.

    use Foo;
    use parent 'Foo';
