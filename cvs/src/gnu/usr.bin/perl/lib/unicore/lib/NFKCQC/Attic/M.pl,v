# This file is for tables that are not necessarily related:  To conserve
# resources, every table that matches the identical set of code points in
# this version of Unicode uses this file.  Each one is listed in a separate
# group below.  It could be that the tables will match the same set of code
# points in other Unicode releases, or it could be purely coincidence that
# they happen to be the same in Unicode 5.2.0, and hence may not in other
# versions.
# 
# This file returns the 103 code points in Unicode Version 5.2.0 that match
# any of the following regular expression constructs:
# 
#         \p{NFKC_Quick_Check=Maybe}
#         \p{NFKC_QC=M}
#         \p{Is_NFKC_Quick_Check=Maybe}
#         \p{Is_NFKC_QC=M}
# 
#         \p{NFC_Quick_Check=Maybe}
#         \p{NFC_QC=M}
#         \p{Is_NFC_Quick_Check=Maybe}
#         \p{Is_NFC_QC=M}
# 
# perluniprops.pod should be consulted for the syntax rules for any of these,
# including if adding or subtracting white space, underscore, and hyphen
# characters matters or doesn't matter, and other permissible syntactic
# variants.  Upper/lower case distinctions never matter.
# 
# A colon can be substituted for the equals sign, and within each group
# above, anything to the left of the equals (or colon) can be combined with
# anything to the right.  Thus, for example,
#         \p{Is_NFC_QC: Maybe}
# is also valid.
# 
# The format of the lines of this file is: START\tSTOP\twhere START is the
# starting code point of the range, in hex; STOP is the ending point, or if
# omitted, the range has just one code point.  Numbers in comments in
# [brackets] indicate how many code points are in the range.
