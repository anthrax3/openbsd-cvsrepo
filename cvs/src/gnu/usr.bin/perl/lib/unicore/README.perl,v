@# The goal is for perl to compile and reasonably run any version of Unicode.

# some tests use characters that aren't encoded in all Unicode versions; others
# have hard-coded the General Categories for a code point that were correct at

# these is given earlier in this file).  Then create the 'version' file with a
# single line, like '6.1.0'.  Do a 'make test' from the project level.  You
# will get some porting errors for needing to regen.  Regenerate what it tells
# you are needed, and make test again.  If you compile an old enough version,
# you will also have to download a few files from later Unicode versions,
# following the instructions that will be given if warranted.  It should
# compile in any release without warnings, except for some casing conflicts
# in Unicode 2.1.8, and some extraneous files will show up in very early
# releases of the form qr/diff.*\.txt/.  If you add Unihan.txt, one line is in error in

The *.txt files were copied 27 Mar 2002 from

	http://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/

The two big files, NormalizationTest.txt (2.0MB) and Unihan.txt
(25.7MB) were not included due to space considerations.  Also NOT
included were any *.html files and the derived files:

	DerivedAge.txt
	DerivedCoreProperties.txt
	DerivedNormalizationProps.txt
	DerivedProperties.txt

and the normalization-related files

	NormalizationCorrections.txt
	NormalizationTest.txt

To be 8.3-friendly, the lib/unicore/PropertyValueAliases.txt was
renamed to be lib/unicore/PropValueAliases.txt, since otherwise
it would have conflicted with lib/unicore/PropertyAliases.txt.

The *.pl files are generated from these files by the mktables script.

You should look in the Unicode release notes (which are probably towards the

these should be added to the respective lists near the beginning of mktables,
using an 'if' to add them for just this Unicode version going forward, so that

When putting out a new Perl release, think about if any of the Deprecated

current one is

mktables has many checks to warn you if there are unexpected or novel things
that it doesn't know how to handle.

# If you download everything, the names of files that are not used by mktables

# mktables is used to generate the tables used by the rest of Perl.  It will
# warn you about any *.txt files in the directory substructure that it doesn't
# know about.  You should remove any so-identified, or edit mktables to add
# them to its lists to process.  You can run
#
#    mktables -globlist
#
#to have it try to process these tables generically.
#
# FOR PUMPKINS
#
# The files are inter-related.  If you take the latest UnicodeData.txt, for
# example, but leave the older versions of other files, there can be subtle
# problems.  So get everything available from Unicode, and delete those which
# aren't needed.
#
# When moving to a new version of Unicode, you need to update 'version' by hand
#
#	p4 edit version
# 	...
#
# You should look in the Unicode release notes (which are probably towards the
# bottom of http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr44/) to see if any properties have
# newly been moved to be Obsolete, Deprecated, or Stabilized.  The full names
# for these should be added to the respective lists near the beginning of
# mktables, using an 'if' to add them for just this Unicode version going
# forward, so that mktables can continue to be used for earlier Unicode
# versions.
#
# When putting out a new Perl release, think about if any of the Deprecated
# properties should be moved to Suppressed.
#
# perlrecharclass.pod has a list of all the characters that are white space,
# which needs to be updated if there are changes.  A quick way to check if
# there have been changes would be to see if the number of such characters
# listed in perluniprops.pod (generated by running mktables) for the property
# \p{White_Space} is no longer 26.  Further investigation would then be
# necessary to classify the new characters as horizontal and vertical.
#
# The code in regexec.c for the \X match construct is intimately tied to the
# regular expression in UAX #29 (http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr29/).  You
# should see if it has changed, and if so regexec.c should be modified.  The
# current one is
# ( CRLF
# | Prepend* ( Hangul-syllable | !Control )
#   ( Grapheme_Extend | Spacing_Mark)*
# | . )
#
# mktables has many checks to warn you if there are unexpected or novel things
# that it doesn't know how to handle.
#
# Module::CoreList should be changed to include the new release
#
# Also, you should regen l1_char_class_tab.h, by
#
# perl regen/mk_L_charclass.pl
#
# and, regen charclass_invlists.h by
#
# perl regen/mk_invlists.pl
