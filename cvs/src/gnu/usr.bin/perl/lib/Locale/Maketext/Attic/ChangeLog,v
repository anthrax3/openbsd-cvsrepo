	* Release 1.07:  Now uses a new and different rule for implicating
	superordinate language tags in accept-language lists.  Previously,
	superordinates were just tacked onto the, so "en-US, ja", turned
	into "en-US, ja, en".  However, this turned out to be suboptimal
	for many users of RT, a popular system using Maketext.  The new
	rule is that a tag implicates superordinate forms right after it,
	unless those tags are explicitly stated elsewhere in the
	accept-languages list.  So "en-US ja" becomes "en-US en ja".  If
	you want "en" to be really lower, you have to actually state it
	there: "en-US ja en" is left as-is.

	The 04super.t and 05super.t tests in t/ have many many examples of
	this, including some strange corner cases.

	(In implementing this change, I also refactored some code in
	Maketext.pm, for hopefully improved readability.  However,
	the above is the only actual change in behavior.)

    * Release 1.12

    Many doc changes from RT.

    Silenced some "used only once" warnings under Perl 5.10.

    $@@ is now localized in case it gets interpolated.  This was added
    a while ago, but now there's a test for it, too.

    Added warnings and strict to tests.

    Cleaning up some Perl::Critic gripes.

    * Release 1.11_01

    Fixed perlbug #33938

    * Release 1.10:

    When debugging is turned on, "DEBUG and warn" is now
