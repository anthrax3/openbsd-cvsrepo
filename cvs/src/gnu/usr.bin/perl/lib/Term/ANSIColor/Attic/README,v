@                        Term::ANSIColor version 1.04
               (A simple ANSI text attribute control module)

  Copyright 1996, 1997, 1998, 2000, 2001 Russ Allbery <rra@@stanford.edu>
  and Zenin <zenin@@bawdycaste.org>.  This program is free software; you
  may redistribute it and/or modify it under the same terms as Perl
  itself.


INTRODUCTION

  This module grew out of a thread on comp.lang.perl.misc where several of
  us were throwing around different ways to print colored text from Perl
  scripts and Zenin posted his old library to do that.  I (Russ) disagreed
  with the implementation and offered my own (the color() and colored()
  functions implemented in this package), Zenin convinced me that the
  constants had their place as well, and we started figuring out the best
  ways of implementing both.

  While ANSI color escape codes are fairly simple, it can be hard to
  remember the codes for all of the attributes and the code resulting from
  hard-coding them into your script is definitely difficult to read.  This
  module is designed to fix those problems, as well as provide a convenient
  interface to do a few things for you automatically (like resetting
  attributes after the text you print out so that you don't accidentally
  leave attributes set).

  Despite its name, this module can also handle non-color ANSI text
  attributes (bold, underline, reverse video, and blink).  It uses either of
  two interfaces, one of which uses "constants" for each different attribute
  and the other of which uses two subs which take strings of attributes as
  arguments.

  See the POD documentation for complete details, features, and usage.


INSTALLATION

  Follow the standard installation procedure for Perl modules, which is to
  type the following commands:

          perl Makefile.PL
          make
          make test
          make install

  You'll probably need to do the last as root.  If instead you wish to
  install the module by hand, simply copy it into a directory named Term in
  your Perl library directory.

  Note that make install, for Perl 5.6.0 or later, will replace the
  Term::ANSIColor that came with Perl.  You may wan to save a backup copy
  of the standard version first.


THANKS

  To Jon Lennox for looking at early versions of this module, providing
  feedback, and offering suggestions for improvement.

  To Jesse Taylor for writing the first significant script to use this
  module (colorized calsplit), thus offering innumerable opportunities to
  test and debug.

  To Jean Delvare for providing documentation of what the various
  attributes do on various different terminal emulators, and for noting
  that attribute 2 is dark.

  To Edward Avis for the implementation of uncolor.

  To Rani Pinchuk for the idea of ANSI_COLORS_DISABLED and an initial
  implementation.

  To Larry Wall, as always, for Perl.

  Term::ANSIColor provides constants and simple functions for sending ANSI
  text attributes, most notably colors.  It can be used to set the current
  text attributes or to apply a set of attributes to a string and reset
  the current text attributes at the end of that string.

DESCRIPTION
d37 4
a46 15
REQUIREMENTS

  Term::ANSIColor is written in pure Perl and has no module dependencies
  that aren't found in Perl core.  It should work with any version of Perl
  after 5.001, although it hasn't been tested with old versions in some
  time.

  The test suite requires the Test::More module.  To check the POD
  documentation, Test::Pod is also required.  To check spelling,
  Pod::Spell and either aspell or ispell with the american dictionary are
  also required.  The user's path is searched for aspell or ispell and
  aspell is preferred.  Spelling tests are disabled by default since
  spelling dictionaries differ too much between systems.  To enable those
  tests, set RRA_MAINTAINER_TESTS to a true value.

  WARNING: Installation of this package will replace the Term::ANSIColor
  that came with Perl for Perl 5.6.0 or later.  Term::ANSIColor that came
  with Perl.  You may want to save a backup copy of the standard version
  first.
