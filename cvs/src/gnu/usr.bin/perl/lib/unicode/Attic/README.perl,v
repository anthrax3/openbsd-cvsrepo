@The *.txt files were copied 30 Aug 2000 from

	http://www.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/

and most of them were renamed to better fit 8.3 filename limitations,
by which the Perl distribution tries to live.

The two big files, NormalizationTest.txt (1.7MB) and Unihan.txt (15.8MB)
were not copied for space considerations.  The files marked with (0) had
not been updated since Unicode 3.0.0 (10 Sep 1999)

The *.pl files are generated from these files by the 'mktables.PL' script.

While the files have been renamed the links in the html files haven't.
