@=head1 NAME

CPAN::API::HOWTO - a recipe book for programming with CPAN.pm

=head1 RECIPES

All of these recipes assume that you have put "use CPAN" at the top of
your program.

=head2 What distribution contains a particular module?

    my $distribution = CPAN::Shell->expand(
        "Module", "Data::UUID"
    )->distribution()->pretty_id();

This returns a string of the form "AUTHORID/TARBALL".  If you want the
full path and filename to this distribution on a CPAN mirror, then it is
C<.../authors/id/A/AU/AUTHORID/TARBALL>.

=head2 What modules does a particular distribution contain?

    CPAN::Index->reload();
    my @@modules = CPAN::Shell->expand(
        "Distribution", "JHI/Graph-0.83.tar.gz"
    )->containsmods();

You may also refer to a distribution in the form A/AU/AUTHORID/TARBALL.
