/* The primary opcode table is made up of the following: */
struct ia64_main_table
{
  /* The entry in the string table that corresponds to the name of this
     opcode. */
  unsigned short name_index;

  /* The type of opcode; corresponds to the TYPE field in 
     struct ia64_opcode. */
  unsigned char opcode_type;

  /* The number of outputs for this opcode. */
  unsigned char num_outputs;

  /* The base insn value for this opcode.  It may be modified by completers. */
  ia64_insn opcode;

  /* The mask of valid bits in OPCODE. Zeros indicate operand fields. */
  ia64_insn mask;

  /* The operands of this instruction.  Corresponds to the OPERANDS field
     in struct ia64_opcode. */

/* Each instruction has a set of possible "completers", or additional
   suffixes that can alter the instruction's behavior, and which has
   potentially different dependencies.

   The completer entries modify certain bits in the instruction opcode.
   Which bits are to be modified are marked by the BITS, MASK and
   OFFSET fields.  The completer entry may also note dependencies for the
   opcode. 

   These completers are arranged in a DAG; the pointers are indexes
   into the completer_table array.  The completer DAG is searched by
   find_completer () and ia64_find_matching_opcode ().

   Note that each completer needs to be applied in turn, so that if we
   have the instruction
   	cmp.lt.unc
   the completer entries for both "lt" and "unc" would need to be applied
   to the opcode's value.

   Some instructions do not require any completers; these contain an
   empty completer entry.  Instructions that require a completer do
   not contain an empty entry.

   Terminal completers (those completers that validly complete an
   instruction) are marked by having the TERMINAL_COMPLETER flag set. 

   Only dependencies listed in the terminal completer for an opcode are
   considered to apply to that opcode instance. */
