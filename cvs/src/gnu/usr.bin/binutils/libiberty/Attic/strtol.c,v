@@deftypefn Supplemental {long int} strtol (const char *@@var{string}, char **@@var{endptr}, int @@var{base})
@@deftypefnx Supplemental {unsigned long int} strtoul (const char *@@var{string}, char **@@var{endptr}, int @@var{base})

The @@code{strtol} function converts the string in @@var{string} to a
long integer value according to the given @@var{base}, which must be
between 2 and 36 inclusive, or be the special value 0.  If @@var{base}
is 0, @@code{strtol} will look for the prefixes @@code{0} and @@code{0x}
to indicate bases 8 and 16, respectively, else default to base 10.
When the base is 16 (either explicitly or implicitly), a prefix of
@@code{0x} is allowed.  The handling of @@var{endptr} is as that of
@@code{strtod} above.  The @@code{strtoul} function is the same, except
that the converted value is unsigned.
