@@chapter Overall Description

This is a heavily modified version of GNU @@code{malloc}.  It uses
@@code{mmap} as the basic mechanism for obtaining memory from the
system, rather than @@code{sbrk}.  This gives it several advantages over the
more traditional malloc:

@@itemize @@bullet
@@item
Several different heaps can be used, each of them growing
or shinking under control of @@code{mmap}, with the @@code{mmalloc} functions
using a specific heap on a call by call basis.

@@item
By using @@code{mmap}, it is easy to create heaps which are intended to
be persistent and exist as a filesystem object after the creating
process has gone away.

@@item
Because multiple heaps can be managed, data used for a 
specific purpose can be allocated into its own heap, making
it easier to allow applications to ``dump'' and ``restore'' initialized
malloc-managed memory regions.  For example, the ``unexec'' hack popularized
by GNU Emacs could potentially go away.
@@end itemize

@@node Implementation,  , Overview, Top
@@chapter Implementation

The @@code{mmalloc} functions contain no internal static state.  All
@@code{mmalloc} internal data is allocated in the mapped in region, along
with the user data that it manages.  This allows it to manage multiple
such regions and to ``pick up where it left off'' when such regions are
later dynamically mapped back in.

In some sense, malloc has been ``purified'' to contain no internal state
information and generalized to use multiple memory regions rather than a
single region managed by @@code{sbrk}.  However the new routines now need an
extra parameter which informs @@code{mmalloc} which memory region it is dealing
with (along with other information).  This parameter is called the
@@dfn{malloc descriptor}.

The functions initially provided by @@code{mmalloc} are:

void *mmalloc_attach (int fd, void *baseaddr);
void *mmalloc_detach (void *md);
int mmalloc_errno (void *md);
int mmalloc_setkey (void *md, int keynum, void *key);
void *mmalloc_getkey (void *md, int keynum);

void *mmalloc (void *md, size_t size);

@@node Compatibility, Functions, Implementation, Implementation
@@section Backwards Compatibility

To allow a single malloc package to be used in a given application,
provision is made for the traditional @@code{malloc}, @@code{realloc}, and
@@code{free} functions to be implemented as special cases of the
@@code{mmalloc} functions.  In particular, if any of the functions that
expect malloc descriptors are called with a @@code{NULL} pointer rather than a
valid malloc descriptor, then they default to using an @@code{sbrk} managed
region.
The @@code{mmalloc} package provides compatible @@code{malloc}, @@code{realloc},
and @@code{free} functions using this mechanism internally.
Applications can avoid this extra interface layer by simply including the
following defines:

@@example
#define malloc(size)		mmalloc ((void *)0, (size))
#define realloc(ptr,size)	mrealloc ((void *)0, (ptr), (size));
#define free(ptr)		mfree ((void *)0, (ptr))
@@end example

@@noindent
or replace the existing @@code{malloc}, @@code{realloc}, and @@code{free}
calls with the above patterns if using @@code{#define} causes problems.

@@node Functions,  , Compatibility, Implementation
@@section Function Descriptions

These are the details on the functions that make up the @@code{mmalloc}
package. 

@@table @@code
@@item void *mmalloc_attach (int @@var{fd}, void *@@var{baseaddr});
Initialize access to a @@code{mmalloc} managed region.

If @@var{fd} is a valid file descriptor for an open file, then data for the
@@code{mmalloc} managed region is mapped to that file.   Otherwise
@@file{/dev/zero} is used and the data will not exist in any filesystem object.

If the open file corresponding to @@var{fd} is from a previous use of
@@code{mmalloc} and passes some basic sanity checks to ensure that it is
compatible with the current @@code{mmalloc} package, then its data is
mapped in and is immediately accessible at the same addresses in
the current process as the process that created the file.

If @@var{baseaddr} is not @@code{NULL}, the mapping is established
starting at the specified address in the process address space.  If
@@var{baseaddr} is @@code{NULL}, the @@code{mmalloc} package chooses a
suitable address at which to start the mapped region, which will be the
value of the previous mapping if opening an existing file which was
previously built by @@code{mmalloc}, or for new files will be a value
chosen by @@code{mmap}.

Specifying @@var{baseaddr} provides more control over where the regions
start and how big they can be before bumping into existing mapped
regions or future mapped regions.

On success, returns a malloc descriptor which is used in subsequent
calls to other @@code{mmalloc} package functions.  It is explicitly
@@samp{void *} (@@samp{char *} for systems that don't fully support
@@code{void}) so that users of the package don't have to worry about the
actual implementation details.

On failure returns @@code{NULL}.

@@item void *mmalloc_detach (void *@@var{md});
Terminate access to a @@code{mmalloc} managed region identified by the
descriptor @@var{md}, by closing the base file and unmapping all memory
pages associated with the region. 

Returns @@code{NULL} on success.

Returns the malloc descriptor on failure, which can subsequently
be used for further action (such as obtaining more information about
the nature of the failure).

@@item void *mmalloc (void *@@var{md}, size_t @@var{size});
Given an @@code{mmalloc} descriptor @@var{md}, allocate additional memory of
@@var{size} bytes in the associated mapped region.

@@item *mrealloc (void *@@var{md}, void *@@var{ptr}, size_t @@var{size});
Given an @@code{mmalloc} descriptor @@var{md} and a pointer to memory
previously allocated by @@code{mmalloc} in @@var{ptr}, reallocate the
memory to be @@var{size} bytes long, possibly moving the existing
contents of memory if necessary.
	
@@item void *mvalloc (void *@@var{md}, size_t @@var{size});
Like @@code{mmalloc} but the resulting memory is aligned on a page boundary.

@@item void mfree (void *@@var{md}, void *@@var{ptr});
Given an @@code{mmalloc} descriptor @@var{md} and a pointer to memory previously
allocated by @@code{mmalloc} in @@var{ptr}, free the previously allocated memory.

@@item int mmalloc_errno (void *@@var{md});
Given a @@code{mmalloc} descriptor, if the last @@code{mmalloc} operation
failed for some reason due to a system call failure, then
returns the associated @@code{errno}.  Returns 0 otherwise.
(This function is not yet implemented).
