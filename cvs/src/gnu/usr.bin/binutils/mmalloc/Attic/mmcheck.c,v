/* Turn on default checking for mmalloc/mrealloc/mfree, for the heap specified
   by MD.  If FUNC is non-NULL, it is a pointer to the function to call
   to abort whenever memory corruption is detected.  By default, this is the
   standard library function abort().

   Note that we disallow installation of initial checking hooks if mmalloc
   has been called at any time for this particular heap, since if any region
   that is allocated prior to installation of the hooks is subsequently
   reallocated or freed after installation of the hooks, it is guaranteed
   to trigger a memory corruption error.  We do this by checking the state
   of the MMALLOC_INITIALIZED flag.  If the FORCE argument is non-zero, this
   checking is disabled and it is allowed to install the checking hooks at any
   time.  This is useful on systems where the C runtime makes one or more
   malloc calls before the user code had a chance to call mmcheck or mmcheckf,
   but never calls free with these values.  Thus if we are certain that only
   values obtained from mallocs after an mmcheck/mmcheckf will ever be passed
   to free(), we can go ahead and force installation of the useful checking
   hooks.

   However, we can call this function at any time after the initial call,
   to update the function pointers to the checking routines and to the
   user defined corruption handler routine, as long as these function pointers
   have been previously extablished by the initial call.  Note that we
   do this automatically when remapping a previously used heap, to ensure
   that the hooks get updated to the correct values, although the corruption
   handler pointer gets set back to the default.  The application can then
   call mmcheck to use a different corruption handler if desired.

   Returns non-zero if checking is successfully enabled, zero otherwise. */
