/* These define the size of main memory for the simulator.

   Note the size of main memory for the H8/300H is only 256k.  Keeping it
   small makes the simulator run much faster and consume less memory.

   The linker knows about the limited size of the simulator's main memory
   on the H8/300H (via the h8300h.sc linker script).  So if you change
   H8300H_MSIZE, be sure to fix the linker script too.

   Also note that there's a separate "eightbit" area aside from main
   memory.  For simplicity, the simulator assumes any data memory reference
   outside of main memory refers to the eightbit area (in theory, this
   can only happen when simulating H8/300H programs).  We make no attempt
   to catch overlapping addresses, wrapped addresses, etc etc.  */
