/* DEVICE
   
   core - root of the device tree
   
   DESCRIPTION
   
   The core device positioned at the root of the device tree appears
   to its child devices as a normal device just like every other
   device in the tree.

   Internally it is implemented using a core object.  Requests to
   attach (or detach) address spaces are passed to that core object.
   Requests to transfer (DMA) data are reflected back down the device
   tree using the core_map data transfer methods.

   PROPERTIES

   None.
