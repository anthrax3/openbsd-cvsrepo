/* Instruction unpacking:

   Once the instruction has been decoded, the register (and other)
   fields within the instruction need to be extracted.

   The table that follows determines how each field should be treated.
   Importantly it considers the case where the extracted field is to
   be used immediatly or stored in an instruction cache.

   <valid>

   Zero marks the end of the table.  More importantly 1. indicates
   that the entry is valid and can be cached. 2. indicates that that
   the entry is valid but can not be cached.

   <old_name>

   The field name as given in the instruction spec.

   <new_name>

   A name for <old_name> once it has been extracted from the
   instructioin (and possibly stored in the instruction cache).

   <type>

   String specifying the storage type for <new_name> (the extracted
   field>.

   <expression>

   Specifies how to get <new_name> from <old_name>.  If null, old and
   new name had better be the same. */
