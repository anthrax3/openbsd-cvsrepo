@Merge conflicts, bringing our changes back in:
- extra $(SHELL) and sugar for make (so that files not mode +x still work)
- safer temp file handling
- our W^X binary layout changes in ld
- OpenBSD policy for library file selection in ld
- arm and m88k changes which were not merged in time for official 2.15
- bfd core file handling
- a couple typos

New for 2.15:
- ld(1) and as(1) manpages now generated at build time
- binutils/stabs.c reverted to use our in-tree libiberty for now
- we still use our VIA C3 crypto code over stock binutils, as it recognizes
  more instructions
- new emulations for OpenBSD on mips64 machines, to help OpenBSD/sgi
- relaxed %f# handling in gas on OpenBSD/sparc64 (same as was in 2.14)

Tested on all platforms by various people; special thanks to sturm@@ and
otto@@.

@ELF security enhancement: put .rodata into it's own load section instead
of putting it with the text. This removes the execute permission
from readonly data. This constrains the executable region to portions
of the executable which need to be executable. Note: not all processors
or mmus are capable of -X protection at the page level, but should
handle ELF images which specify specific RWX protections on each section.

@This is a project to modify executables so that they do not have any
executable regions which are writable. If a section of an executable is
writable and executable, it is much easier for errant code to modify the
executable's behavior.

Two current areas in shared library environments which have this
critical problem are the GOT (Global Offset Table) and PLT (Procedure
Linkage Table). The PLT is required to be executable and both GOT and
PLT are writable on most architectures. On most ELF architecture
machines this would cause shared libraries to have data and BSS marked
as executable.

Padding to the linker script for programs and shared libraries/objects
to isolate the GOT and PLT into their own load sections in the
executables. This allows only the text(readonly) region and the PLT
region to be marked executable with the normal data and BSS not marked
as executable. The PLT region is still marked executable on most
architectures because the PLT lives in the "data" or "BSS" regions
and the dynamic loader will need to modify it. Since the GOT and PLT
should only ever be written by the dynamic linker, it will be modified
to mprotect those regions so that they are not writable during normal
execution. If the dynamic linker needs to modify the regions later,
(eg for lazy binding), it will mprotect the region, make the necessary
changes, and mprotect it back. Since it is possible to receive a
signal which would interrupt the program flow and perhaps cause the
dynamic linker to modify the same (or nearby) PLT references, it is now
necessary for signals to be blocked for the duration of the mprotect.

@In an ELF binary the end of the text segment and the start of the data
segment can share the same page in the file. Since we can't mmap it with
the same permissions, the data segment is loaded offset by a constant so
that it ends up in a different page.

On sparc that's not really enough. To avoid cache aliases we have to make
the offset big enough to make sure that we don't get incoherent aliases
that would have to be mapped uncached. This offset has been 64k this
far and noone noticed until some change actually made us fault in those
pages at the same time and incoherent aliases reduced make build time on
some hypersparcs (only hypersparcs have big enough caches to notice this)
from 14 hours to 23 hours.

Bump that offset (MAXPAGESIZE) to 1MB.
