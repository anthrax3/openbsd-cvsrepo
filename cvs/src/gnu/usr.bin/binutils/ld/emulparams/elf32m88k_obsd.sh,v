1.1
log
@m88k ELF toolchain, supporting static binaries only so far.

Assembler supports a register prefix of `#' when configured for SVR4, and `%'
when configured for OpenBSD. Pseudo-ops do not need a leading dot, except
when configured for OpenBSD, allowing the `set' instruction to be recognized
correctly.

Based upon various unfinished or unreliable works, including smurph@@'s early
work in 2003, my own attempts in 2004 and 2005, and Michael Kato's binutils
2.15 diff from 2005. Support for register prefixes, as well as fixing an
evil off-by-one in resolving 16-bit pc-relative relocations in ld (which would
only affect kernel .S files branching to global symbols), came as part of the
2012 work.

Not enabled yet (needs Makefile.bsd-wrapper, bfd/config.bfd and
gdb/configure.tgt updates to completely enable) so as not to disturb the
existing a.out toolchain builds; will hopefully be enabled very soon.
