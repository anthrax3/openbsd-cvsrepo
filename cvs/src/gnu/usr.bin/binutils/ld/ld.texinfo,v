log
@Merge conflicts, bringing our changes back in:
- extra $(SHELL) and sugar for make (so that files not mode +x still work)
- safer temp file handling
- our W^X binary layout changes in ld
- OpenBSD policy for library file selection in ld
- arm and m88k changes which were not merged in time for official 2.15
- bfd core file handling
- a couple typos

New for 2.15:
- ld(1) and as(1) manpages now generated at build time
- binutils/stabs.c reverted to use our in-tree libiberty for now
- we still use our VIA C3 crypto code over stock binutils, as it recognizes
  more instructions
- new emulations for OpenBSD on mips64 machines, to help OpenBSD/sgi
- relaxed %f# handling in gas on OpenBSD/sparc64 (same as was in 2.14)

Tested on all platforms by various people; special thanks to sturm@@ and
otto@@.

@@c man begin DESCRIPTION

@@command{ld} combines a number of object and archive files, relocates
their data and ties up symbol references. Usually the last step in
compiling a program is to run @@command{ld}.

@@command{ld} accepts Linker Command Language files written in
a superset of AT&T's Link Editor Command Language syntax,
to provide explicit and total control over the linking process.

@@ifset man
@@c For the man only
This man page does not describe the command language; see the 
@@command{ld} entry in @@code{info}, or the manual
ld: the GNU linker, for full details on the command language and 
on other aspects of the GNU linker. 
@@end ifset

@@ifclear SingleFormat
This version of @@command{ld} uses the general purpose BFD libraries
to operate on object files. This allows @@command{ld} to read, combine, and
write object files in many different formats---for example, COFF or
@@code{a.out}.  Different formats may be linked together to produce any
available kind of object file.  @@xref{BFD}, for more information.
@@end ifclear

Aside from its flexibility, the @@sc{gnu} linker is more helpful than other
linkers in providing diagnostic information.  Many linkers abandon
execution immediately upon encountering an error; whenever possible,
@@command{ld} continues executing, allowing you to identify other errors
(or, in some cases, to get an output file in spite of the error).

@@cindex options

@@c man begin OPTIONS

The linker supports a plethora of command-line options, but in actual
practice few of them are used in any particular context.
@@cindex standard Unix system
For instance, a frequent use of @@command{ld} is to link standard Unix
object files on a standard, supported Unix system.  On such a system, to
link a file @@code{hello.o}:

@@smallexample
ld -o @@var{output} /lib/crt0.o hello.o -lc
@@end smallexample

This tells @@command{ld} to produce a file called @@var{output} as the
result of linking the file @@code{/lib/crt0.o} with @@code{hello.o} and
the library @@code{libc.a}, which will come from the standard search
directories.  (See the discussion of the @@samp{-l} option below.)

Some of the command-line options to @@command{ld} may be specified at any
point in the command line.  However, options which refer to files, such
as @@samp{-l} or @@samp{-T}, cause the file to be read at the point at
which the option appears in the command line, relative to the object
files and other file options.  Repeating non-file options with a
different argument will either have no further effect, or override prior
occurrences (those further to the left on the command line) of that
option.  Options which may be meaningfully specified more than once are
noted in the descriptions below.

@@cindex object files
Non-option arguments are object files or archives which are to be linked
together.  They may follow, precede, or be mixed in with command-line
options, except that an object file argument may not be placed between
an option and its argument.

Usually the linker is invoked with at least one object file, but you can
specify other forms of binary input files using @@samp{-l}, @@samp{-R},
and the script command language.  If @@emph{no} binary input files at all
are specified, the linker does not produce any output, and issues the
message @@samp{No input files}.

If the linker cannot recognize the format of an object file, it will
assume that it is a linker script.  A script specified in this way
augments the main linker script used for the link (either the default
linker script or the one specified by using @@samp{-T}).  This feature
permits the linker to link against a file which appears to be an object
or an archive, but actually merely defines some symbol values, or uses
@@code{INPUT} or @@code{GROUP} to load other objects.  Note that
specifying a script in this way merely augments the main linker script;
use the @@samp{-T} option to replace the default linker script entirely.
@@xref{Scripts}.

For options whose names are a single letter,
option arguments must either follow the option letter without intervening
whitespace, or be given as separate arguments immediately following the
option that requires them.

For options whose names are multiple letters, either one dash or two can
precede the option name; for example, @@samp{-trace-symbol} and
@@samp{--trace-symbol} are equivalent.  Note---there is one exception to
this rule.  Multiple letter options that start with a lower case 'o' can
only be preceeded by two dashes.  This is to reduce confusion with the
@@samp{-o} option.  So for example @@samp{-omagic} sets the output file
name to @@samp{magic} whereas @@samp{--omagic} sets the NMAGIC flag on the
output.

Arguments to multiple-letter options must either be separated from the
option name by an equals sign, or be given as separate arguments
immediately following the option that requires them.  For example,
@@samp{--trace-symbol foo} and @@samp{--trace-symbol=foo} are equivalent.
Unique abbreviations of the names of multiple-letter options are
accepted.

Note---if the linker is being invoked indirectly, via a compiler driver
(e.g. @@samp{gcc}) then all the linker command line options should be
prefixed by @@samp{-Wl,} (or whatever is appropriate for the particular
compiler driver) like this:

@@smallexample
  gcc -Wl,--startgroup foo.o bar.o -Wl,--endgroup
@@end smallexample

This is important, because otherwise the compiler driver program may
silently drop the linker options, resulting in a bad link.

Here is a table of the generic command line switches accepted by the GNU
linker:

@@table @@gcctabopt
@@kindex -a@@var{keyword}
@@item -a@@var{keyword}
This option is supported for HP/UX compatibility.  The @@var{keyword}
argument must be one of the strings @@samp{archive}, @@samp{shared}, or
@@samp{default}.  @@samp{-aarchive} is functionally equivalent to
@@samp{-Bstatic}, and the other two keywords are functionally equivalent
to @@samp{-Bdynamic}.  This option may be used any number of times.

@@ifset I960
@@cindex architectures
@@kindex -A@@var{arch}
@@item -A@@var{architecture}
@@kindex --architecture=@@var{arch}
@@itemx --architecture=@@var{architecture}
In the current release of @@command{ld}, this option is useful only for the
Intel 960 family of architectures.  In that @@command{ld} configuration, the
@@var{architecture} argument identifies the particular architecture in
the 960 family, enabling some safeguards and modifying the
archive-library search path.  @@xref{i960,,@@command{ld} and the Intel 960
family}, for details.

Future releases of @@command{ld} may support similar functionality for
other architecture families.

@@kindex --format=@@var{format}
@@cindex input format
@@cindex input format
@@item -b @@var{input-format}
@@itemx --format=@@var{input-format}
@@command{ld} may be configured to support more than one kind of object
file.  If your @@command{ld} is configured this way, you can use the
@@samp{-b} option to specify the binary format for input object files
that follow this option on the command line.  Even when @@command{ld} is
configured to support alternative object formats, you don't usually need
to specify this, as @@command{ld} should be configured to expect as a
default input format the most usual format on each machine.
@@var{input-format} is a text string, the name of a particular format
supported by the BFD libraries.  (You can list the available binary
formats with @@samp{objdump -i}.)
@@xref{BFD}.

You may want to use this option if you are linking files with an unusual
binary format.  You can also use @@samp{-b} to switch formats explicitly (when
linking object files of different formats), by including
@@samp{-b @@var{input-format}} before each group of object files in a
particular format.

The default format is taken from the environment variable
@@code{GNUTARGET}.

@@kindex --mri-script=@@var{MRI-cmdfile}
@@cindex compatibility, MRI
@@item -c @@var{MRI-commandfile}
@@itemx --mri-script=@@var{MRI-commandfile}
For compatibility with linkers produced by MRI, @@command{ld} accepts script
files written in an alternate, restricted command language, described in
@@ifclear man
@@ref{MRI,,MRI Compatible Script Files}.
@@end ifclear

the MRI Compatible Script Files section of GNU ld documentation.
@@end ifset
Introduce MRI script files with
the option @@samp{-c}; use the @@samp{-T} option to run linker
scripts written in the general-purpose @@command{ld} scripting language.
If @@var{MRI-cmdfile} does not exist, @@command{ld} looks for it in the directories
specified by any @@samp{-L} options.

@@cindex common allocation
@@kindex -d
@@kindex -dc
@@kindex -dp
@@item -d
@@itemx -dc
@@itemx -dp
These three options are equivalent; multiple forms are supported for
compatibility with other linkers.  They assign space to common symbols
even if a relocatable output file is specified (with @@samp{-r}).  The
script command @@code{FORCE_COMMON_ALLOCATION} has the same effect.
@@xref{Miscellaneous Commands}.

@@cindex entry point, from command line
@@kindex -e @@var{entry}
@@kindex --entry=@@var{entry}
@@item -e @@var{entry}
@@itemx --entry=@@var{entry}
Use @@var{entry} as the explicit symbol for beginning execution of your
program, rather than the default entry point.  If there is no symbol
named @@var{entry}, the linker will try to parse @@var{entry} as a number,
and use that as the entry address (the number will be interpreted in
base 10; you may use a leading @@samp{0x} for base 16, or a leading
@@samp{0} for base 8).  @@xref{Entry Point}, for a discussion of defaults
and other ways of specifying the entry point.

@@cindex dynamic symbol table
@@kindex -E
@@kindex --export-dynamic
@@item -E
@@itemx --export-dynamic
When creating a dynamically linked executable, add all symbols to the
dynamic symbol table.  The dynamic symbol table is the set of symbols
which are visible from dynamic objects at run time.

If you do not use this option, the dynamic symbol table will normally
contain only those symbols which are referenced by some dynamic object
mentioned in the link.

If you use @@code{dlopen} to load a dynamic object which needs to refer
back to the symbols defined by the program, rather than some other
dynamic object, then you will probably need to use this option when
linking the program itself.

You can also use the version script to control what symbols should
be added to the dynamic symbol table if the output format supports it.
See the description of @@samp{--version-script} in @@ref{VERSION}.

@@kindex -f
@@kindex --auxiliary
@@item -f
@@itemx --auxiliary @@var{name}
When creating an ELF shared object, set the internal DT_AUXILIARY field
to the specified name.  This tells the dynamic linker that the symbol
table of the shared object should be used as an auxiliary filter on the
symbol table of the shared object @@var{name}.

If you later link a program against this filter object, then, when you
run the program, the dynamic linker will see the DT_AUXILIARY field.  If
the dynamic linker resolves any symbols from the filter object, it will
first check whether there is a definition in the shared object
@@var{name}.  If there is one, it will be used instead of the definition
in the filter object.  The shared object @@var{name} need not exist.
Thus the shared object @@var{name} may be used to provide an alternative
implementation of certain functions, perhaps for debugging or for
machine specific performance.

This option may be specified more than once.  The DT_AUXILIARY entries
will be created in the order in which they appear on the command line.

@@kindex -F
@@kindex --filter
@@item -F @@var{name}
@@itemx --filter @@var{name}
When creating an ELF shared object, set the internal DT_FILTER field to
the specified name.  This tells the dynamic linker that the symbol table
of the shared object which is being created should be used as a filter
on the symbol table of the shared object @@var{name}.

If you later link a program against this filter object, then, when you
run the program, the dynamic linker will see the DT_FILTER field.  The
dynamic linker will resolve symbols according to the symbol table of the
filter object as usual, but it will actually link to the definitions
found in the shared object @@var{name}.  Thus the filter object can be
used to select a subset of the symbols provided by the object
@@var{name}.

Some older linkers used the @@option{-F} option throughout a compilation
toolchain for specifying object-file format for both input and output
object files.
@@ifclear SingleFormat
The @@sc{gnu} linker uses other mechanisms for this purpose: the
@@option{-b}, @@option{--format}, @@option{--oformat} options, the 
@@code{TARGET} command in linker scripts, and the @@code{GNUTARGET}
environment variable.
@@end ifclear
The @@sc{gnu} linker will ignore the @@option{-F} option when not
creating an ELF shared object.

@@cindex finalization function
@@kindex -fini
@@item -fini @@var{name}
When creating an ELF executable or shared object, call NAME when the
executable or shared object is unloaded, by setting DT_FINI to the
address of the function.  By default, the linker uses @@code{_fini} as
the function to call.

@@kindex -g
@@item -g
Ignored.  Provided for compatibility with other tools.

@@kindex -G
@@kindex --gpsize
@@cindex object size
@@item -G@@var{value}
@@itemx --gpsize=@@var{value}
Set the maximum size of objects to be optimized using the GP register to
@@var{size}.  This is only meaningful for object file formats such as
MIPS ECOFF which supports putting large and small objects into different
sections.  This is ignored for other object file formats.

@@cindex runtime library name
@@kindex -h@@var{name}
@@kindex -soname=@@var{name}
@@item -h@@var{name}
@@itemx -soname=@@var{name}
When creating an ELF shared object, set the internal DT_SONAME field to
the specified name.  When an executable is linked with a shared object
which has a DT_SONAME field, then when the executable is run the dynamic
linker will attempt to load the shared object specified by the DT_SONAME
field rather than the using the file name given to the linker.

@@kindex -i
@@cindex incremental link
@@item -i
Perform an incremental link (same as option @@samp{-r}).

@@cindex initialization function
@@kindex -init
@@item -init @@var{name}
When creating an ELF executable or shared object, call NAME when the
executable or shared object is loaded, by setting DT_INIT to the address
of the function.  By default, the linker uses @@code{_init} as the
function to call.

@@cindex archive files, from cmd line
@@kindex -l@@var{archive}
@@kindex --library=@@var{archive}
@@item -l@@var{archive}
@@itemx --library=@@var{archive}
Add archive file @@var{archive} to the list of files to link.  This
option may be used any number of times.  @@command{ld} will search its
path-list for occurrences of @@code{lib@@var{archive}.a} for every
@@var{archive} specified.

On systems which support shared libraries, @@command{ld} may also search for
libraries with extensions other than @@code{.a}.  Specifically, on ELF
and SunOS systems, @@command{ld} will search a directory for a library with
an extension of @@code{.so} before searching for one with an extension of
@@code{.a}.  By convention, a @@code{.so} extension indicates a shared
library.

The linker will search an archive only once, at the location where it is
specified on the command line.  If the archive defines a symbol which
was undefined in some object which appeared before the archive on the
command line, the linker will include the appropriate file(s) from the
archive.  However, an undefined symbol in an object appearing later on
the command line will not cause the linker to search the archive again.

See the @@option{-(} option for a way to force the linker to search
archives multiple times.

You may list the same archive multiple times on the command line.

@@ifset GENERIC
This type of archive searching is standard for Unix linkers.  However,
if you are using @@command{ld} on AIX, note that it is different from the
behaviour of the AIX linker.
@@end ifset

@@cindex search directory, from cmd line
@@kindex -L@@var{dir}
@@kindex --library-path=@@var{dir}
@@item -L@@var{searchdir}
@@itemx --library-path=@@var{searchdir}
Add path @@var{searchdir} to the list of paths that @@command{ld} will search
for archive libraries and @@command{ld} control scripts.  You may use this
option any number of times.  The directories are searched in the order
in which they are specified on the command line.  Directories specified
on the command line are searched before the default directories.  All
@@option{-L} options apply to all @@option{-l} options, regardless of the
order in which the options appear.

If @@var{searchdir} begins with @@code{=}, then the @@code{=} will be replaced
by the @@dfn{sysroot prefix}, a path specified when the linker is configured.

@@ifset UsesEnvVars
The default set of paths searched (without being specified with
@@samp{-L}) depends on which emulation mode @@command{ld} is using, and in
some cases also on how it was configured.  @@xref{Environment}.
@@end ifset

The paths can also be specified in a link script with the
@@code{SEARCH_DIR} command.  Directories specified this way are searched
at the point in which the linker script appears in the command line.

@@cindex emulation
@@kindex -m @@var{emulation}
@@item -m@@var{emulation}
Emulate the @@var{emulation} linker.  You can list the available
emulations with the @@samp{--verbose} or @@samp{-V} options.

If the @@samp{-m} option is not used, the emulation is taken from the
@@code{LDEMULATION} environment variable, if that is defined.

Otherwise, the default emulation depends upon how the linker was
configured.

@@cindex link map
@@kindex -M
@@kindex --print-map
@@item -M
@@itemx --print-map
Print a link map to the standard output.  A link map provides
information about the link, including the following:

@@itemize @@bullet
@@item
Where object files and symbols are mapped into memory.
@@item
How common symbols are allocated.
@@item
All archive members included in the link, with a mention of the symbol
which caused the archive member to be brought in.
@@end itemize

@@kindex -n
@@cindex read-only text
@@cindex NMAGIC
@@kindex --nmagic
@@item -n
@@itemx --nmagic
Turn off page alignment of sections, and mark the output as
@@code{NMAGIC} if possible.

@@kindex -N
@@kindex --omagic
@@cindex read/write from cmd line
@@cindex OMAGIC
@@item -N
@@itemx --omagic
Set the text and data sections to be readable and writable.  Also, do
not page-align the data segment, and disable linking against shared
libraries.  If the output format supports Unix style magic numbers,
mark the output as @@code{OMAGIC}. Note: Although a writable text section
is allowed for PE-COFF targets, it does not conform to the format
specification published by Microsoft.

@@kindex --no-omagic
@@cindex OMAGIC
@@item --no-omagic
This option negates most of the effects of the @@option{-N} option.  It
sets the text section to be read-only, and forces the data segment to
be page-aligned.  Note - this option does not enable linking against
shared libraries.  Use @@option{-Bdynamic} for this.

@@kindex -o @@var{output}
@@kindex --output=@@var{output}
@@cindex naming the output file
@@item -o @@var{output}
@@itemx --output=@@var{output}
Use @@var{output} as the name for the program produced by @@command{ld}; if this
option is not specified, the name @@file{a.out} is used by default.  The
script command @@code{OUTPUT} can also specify the output file name.

@@kindex -O @@var{level}
@@cindex generating optimized output
@@item -O @@var{level}
If @@var{level} is a numeric values greater than zero @@command{ld} optimizes
the output.  This might take significantly longer and therefore probably
should only be enabled for the final binary.

@@kindex -q
@@kindex --emit-relocs
@@cindex retain relocations in final executable
@@item -q
@@itemx --emit-relocs
Leave relocation sections and contents in fully linked exececutables.
Post link analysis and optimization tools may need this information in
order to perform correct modifications of executables.  This results
in larger executables.

This option is currently only supported on ELF platforms.

@@cindex partial link
@@cindex relocatable output
@@kindex -r
@@kindex --relocatable
@@item -r
@@itemx --relocatable
Generate relocatable output---i.e., generate an output file that can in
turn serve as input to @@command{ld}.  This is often called @@dfn{partial
linking}.  As a side effect, in environments that support standard Unix
magic numbers, this option also sets the output file's magic number to
@@code{OMAGIC}.
@@c ; see @@option{-N}.
If this option is not specified, an absolute file is produced.  When
linking C++ programs, this option @@emph{will not} resolve references to
constructors; to do that, use @@samp{-Ur}.

When an input file does not have the same format as the output file,
partial linking is only supported if that input file does not contain any
relocations.  Different output formats can have further restrictions; for
example some @@code{a.out}-based formats do not support partial linking
with input files in other formats at all.

This option does the same thing as @@samp{-i}.

@@kindex -R @@var{file}
@@kindex --just-symbols=@@var{file}
@@cindex symbol-only input
@@item -R @@var{filename}
@@itemx --just-symbols=@@var{filename}
Read symbol names and their addresses from @@var{filename}, but do not
relocate it or include it in the output.  This allows your output file
to refer symbolically to absolute locations of memory defined in other
programs.  You may use this option more than once.

For compatibility with other ELF linkers, if the @@option{-R} option is
followed by a directory name, rather than a file name, it is treated as
the @@option{-rpath} option.

@@kindex -s
@@kindex --strip-all
@@cindex strip all symbols
@@item -s
@@itemx --strip-all
Omit all symbol information from the output file.

@@kindex -S
@@kindex --strip-debug
@@cindex strip debugger symbols
@@item -S
@@itemx --strip-debug
Omit debugger symbol information (but not all symbols) from the output file.

@@kindex -t
@@kindex --trace
@@cindex input files, displaying
@@item -t
@@itemx --trace
Print the names of the input files as @@command{ld} processes them.

@@kindex -T @@var{script}
@@kindex --script=@@var{script}
@@cindex script files
@@item -T @@var{scriptfile}
@@itemx --script=@@var{scriptfile}
Use @@var{scriptfile} as the linker script.  This script replaces
@@command{ld}'s default linker script (rather than adding to it), so
@@var{commandfile} must specify everything necessary to describe the
output file.  @@xref{Scripts}.  If @@var{scriptfile} does not exist in
the current directory, @@code{ld} looks for it in the directories
specified by any preceding @@samp{-L} options.  Multiple @@samp{-T}
options accumulate.

@@kindex -u @@var{symbol}
@@kindex --undefined=@@var{symbol}
@@cindex undefined symbol
@@item -u @@var{symbol}
@@itemx --undefined=@@var{symbol}
Force @@var{symbol} to be entered in the output file as an undefined
symbol.  Doing this may, for example, trigger linking of additional
modules from standard libraries.  @@samp{-u} may be repeated with
different option arguments to enter additional undefined symbols.  This
option is equivalent to the @@code{EXTERN} linker script command.

@@kindex -Ur
@@cindex constructors
@@item -Ur
For anything other than C++ programs, this option is equivalent to
@@samp{-r}: it generates relocatable output---i.e., an output file that can in
turn serve as input to @@command{ld}.  When linking C++ programs, @@samp{-Ur}
@@emph{does} resolve references to constructors, unlike @@samp{-r}.
It does not work to use @@samp{-Ur} on files that were themselves linked
with @@samp{-Ur}; once the constructor table has been built, it cannot
be added to.  Use @@samp{-Ur} only for the last partial link, and
@@samp{-r} for the others.

@@kindex --unique[=@@var{SECTION}]
@@item --unique[=@@var{SECTION}]
Creates a separate output section for every input section matching
@@var{SECTION}, or if the optional wildcard @@var{SECTION} argument is
missing, for every orphan input section.  An orphan section is one not
specifically mentioned in a linker script.  You may use this option
multiple times on the command line;  It prevents the normal merging of
input sections with the same name, overriding output section assignments
in a linker script.

@@kindex -v
@@kindex -V
@@kindex --version
@@cindex version
@@item -v
@@itemx --version
@@itemx -V
Display the version number for @@command{ld}.  The @@option{-V} option also
lists the supported emulations.

@@kindex -x
@@kindex --discard-all
@@cindex deleting local symbols
@@item -x
@@itemx --discard-all
Delete all local symbols.

@@kindex -X
@@kindex --discard-locals
@@cindex local symbols, deleting
@@cindex L, deleting symbols beginning
@@item -X
@@itemx --discard-locals
Delete all temporary local symbols.  For most targets, this is all local
symbols whose names begin with @@samp{L}.

@@kindex -y @@var{symbol}
@@kindex --trace-symbol=@@var{symbol}
@@cindex symbol tracing
@@item -y @@var{symbol}
@@itemx --trace-symbol=@@var{symbol}
Print the name of each linked file in which @@var{symbol} appears.  This
option may be given any number of times.  On many systems it is necessary
to prepend an underscore.

This option is useful when you have an undefined symbol in your link but
don't know where the reference is coming from.

@@kindex -Y @@var{path}
@@item -Y @@var{path}
Add @@var{path} to the default library search path.  This option exists
for Solaris compatibility.

@@kindex -z @@var{keyword}
@@item -z @@var{keyword}
The recognized keywords are:
@@table @@samp

@@item combreloc
Combines multiple reloc sections and sorts them to make dynamic symbol
lookup caching possible.

@@item defs
Disallows undefined symbols in object files.  Undefined symbols in
shared libraries are still allowed.

@@item initfirst
This option is only meaningful when building a shared object.
It marks the object so that its runtime initialization will occur
before the runtime initialization of any other objects brought into
the process at the same time.  Similarly the runtime finalization of
the object will occur after the runtime finalization of any other
objects.

@@item interpose
Marks the object that its symbol table interposes before all symbols
but the primary executable.

@@item loadfltr
Marks  the object that its filters be processed immediately at
runtime.

@@item muldefs
Allows multiple definitions.

@@item nocombreloc
Disables multiple reloc sections combining.

@@item nocopyreloc
Disables production of copy relocs.

@@item nodefaultlib
Marks the object that the search for dependencies of this object will
ignore any default library search paths.

@@item nodelete
Marks the object shouldn't be unloaded at runtime.

@@item nodlopen
Marks the object not available to @@code{dlopen}.

@@item nodump
Marks the object can not be dumped by @@code{dldump}.

@@item now
When generating an executable or shared library, mark it to tell the
dynamic linker to resolve all symbols when the program is started, or
when the shared library is linked to using dlopen, instead of
deferring function call resolution to the point when the function is
first called.

@@item origin
Marks the object may contain $ORIGIN.

@@end table

Other keywords are ignored for Solaris compatibility.  

@@kindex -Z
@@item -Z
Produce 'Standard' executables, disables Writable XOR Executable features
in resulting binaries.

@@kindex -(
@@cindex groups of archives
@@item -( @@var{archives} -)
@@itemx --start-group @@var{archives} --end-group
The @@var{archives} should be a list of archive files.  They may be
either explicit file names, or @@samp{-l} options.

The specified archives are searched repeatedly until no new undefined
references are created.  Normally, an archive is searched only once in
the order that it is specified on the command line.  If a symbol in that
archive is needed to resolve an undefined symbol referred to by an
object in an archive that appears later on the command line, the linker
would not be able to resolve that reference.  By grouping the archives,
they all be searched repeatedly until all possible references are
resolved.

Using this option has a significant performance cost.  It is best to use
it only when there are unavoidable circular references between two or
more archives.

@@kindex --accept-unknown-input-arch
@@kindex --no-accept-unknown-input-arch
@@item --accept-unknown-input-arch
@@itemx --no-accept-unknown-input-arch
Tells the linker to accept input files whose architecture cannot be
recognised.  The assumption is that the user knows what they are doing
and deliberately wants to link in these unknown input files.  This was
the default behaviour of the linker, before release 2.14.  The default
behaviour from release 2.14 onwards is to reject such input files, and
so the @@samp{--accept-unknown-input-arch} option has been added to
restore the old behaviour.

@@kindex --as-needed
@@kindex --no-as-needed
@@item --as-needed
@@itemx --no-as-needed
This option affects ELF DT_NEEDED tags for dynamic libraries mentioned
on the command line after the @@option{--as-needed} option.  Normally,
the linker will add a DT_NEEDED tag for each dynamic library mentioned
on the command line, regardless of whether the library is actually
needed. @@option{--as-needed} causes DT_NEEDED tags to only be emitted
for libraries that satisfy some reference from regular objects.
@@option{--no-as-needed} restores the default behaviour.

@@kindex -assert @@var{keyword}
@@item -assert @@var{keyword}
This option is ignored for SunOS compatibility.

@@kindex -Bdynamic
@@kindex -dy
@@kindex -call_shared
@@item -Bdynamic
@@itemx -dy
@@itemx -call_shared
Link against dynamic libraries.  This is only meaningful on platforms
for which shared libraries are supported.  This option is normally the
default on such platforms.  The different variants of this option are
for compatibility with various systems.  You may use this option
multiple times on the command line: it affects library searching for
@@option{-l} options which follow it.

@@kindex -Bgroup
@@item -Bgroup
Set the @@code{DF_1_GROUP} flag in the @@code{DT_FLAGS_1} entry in the dynamic
section.  This causes the runtime linker to handle lookups in this
object and its dependencies to be performed only inside the group.
@@option{--unresolved-symbols=report-all} is implied.  This option is
only meaningful on ELF platforms which support shared libraries.

@@kindex -Bstatic
@@kindex -dn
@@kindex -non_shared
@@kindex -static
@@item -Bstatic
@@itemx -dn
@@itemx -non_shared
@@itemx -static
Do not link against shared libraries.  This is only meaningful on
platforms for which shared libraries are supported.  The different
variants of this option are for compatibility with various systems.  You
may use this option multiple times on the command line: it affects
library searching for @@option{-l} options which follow it.  This
option also implies @@option{--unresolved-symbols=report-all}.

@@kindex -Bsymbolic
@@item -Bsymbolic
When creating a shared library, bind references to global symbols to the
definition within the shared library, if any.  Normally, it is possible
for a program linked against a shared library to override the definition
within the shared library.  This option is only meaningful on ELF
platforms which support shared libraries.

@@kindex --check-sections
@@kindex --no-check-sections
@@item --check-sections
@@itemx --no-check-sections
Asks the linker @@emph{not} to check section addresses after they have
been assigned to see if there any overlaps.  Normally the linker will
perform this check, and if it finds any overlaps it will produce
suitable error messages.  The linker does know about, and does make
allowances for sections in overlays.  The default behaviour can be
restored by using the command line switch @@option{--check-sections}.

@@cindex cross reference table
@@kindex --cref
@@item --cref
Output a cross reference table.  If a linker map file is being
generated, the cross reference table is printed to the map file.
Otherwise, it is printed on the standard output.

The format of the table is intentionally simple, so that it may be
easily processed by a script if necessary.  The symbols are printed out,
sorted by name.  For each symbol, a list of file names is given.  If the
symbol is defined, the first file listed is the location of the
definition.  The remaining files contain references to the symbol.

@@cindex common allocation
@@kindex --no-define-common
@@item --no-define-common
This option inhibits the assignment of addresses to common symbols.
The script command @@code{INHIBIT_COMMON_ALLOCATION} has the same effect.
@@xref{Miscellaneous Commands}.

The @@samp{--no-define-common} option allows decoupling
the decision to assign addresses to Common symbols from the choice
of the output file type; otherwise a non-Relocatable output type
forces assigning addresses to Common symbols.
Using @@samp{--no-define-common} allows Common symbols that are referenced
from a shared library to be assigned addresses only in the main program.
This eliminates the unused duplicate space in the shared library,
and also prevents any possible confusion over resolving to the wrong
duplicate when there are many dynamic modules with specialized search
paths for runtime symbol resolution.

@@cindex symbols, from command line
@@kindex --defsym @@var{symbol}=@@var{exp}
@@item --defsym @@var{symbol}=@@var{expression}
Create a global symbol in the output file, containing the absolute
address given by @@var{expression}.  You may use this option as many
times as necessary to define multiple symbols in the command line.  A
limited form of arithmetic is supported for the @@var{expression} in this
context: you may give a hexadecimal constant or the name of an existing
symbol, or use @@code{+} and @@code{-} to add or subtract hexadecimal
constants or symbols.  If you need more elaborate expressions, consider
using the linker command language from a script (@@pxref{Assignments,,
Assignment: Symbol Definitions}).  @@emph{Note:} there should be no white
space between @@var{symbol}, the equals sign (``@@key{=}''), and
@@var{expression}.

@@cindex demangling, from command line
@@kindex --demangle[=@@var{style}]
@@kindex --no-demangle
@@item --demangle[=@@var{style}]
@@itemx --no-demangle
These options control whether to demangle symbol names in error messages
and other output.  When the linker is told to demangle, it tries to
present symbol names in a readable fashion: it strips leading
underscores if they are used by the object file format, and converts C++
mangled symbol names into user readable names.  Different compilers have
different mangling styles.  The optional demangling style argument can be used
to choose an appropriate demangling style for your compiler.  The linker will
demangle by default unless the environment variable @@samp{COLLECT_NO_DEMANGLE}
is set.  These options may be used to override the default.

@@cindex dynamic linker, from command line
@@kindex -I@@var{file}
@@kindex --dynamic-linker @@var{file}
@@item --dynamic-linker @@var{file}
Set the name of the dynamic linker.  This is only meaningful when
generating dynamically linked ELF executables.  The default dynamic
linker is normally correct; don't use this unless you know what you are
doing.

@@cindex MIPS embedded PIC code
@@kindex --embedded-relocs
@@item --embedded-relocs
This option is only meaningful when linking MIPS embedded PIC code,
generated by the -membedded-pic option to the @@sc{gnu} compiler and
assembler.  It causes the linker to create a table which may be used at
runtime to relocate any data which was statically initialized to pointer
values.  See the code in testsuite/ld-empic for details.


@@kindex --fatal-warnings
@@item --fatal-warnings
Treat all warnings as errors.

@@kindex --force-exe-suffix
@@item  --force-exe-suffix
Make sure that an output file has a .exe suffix.

If a successfully built fully linked output file does not have a
@@code{.exe} or @@code{.dll} suffix, this option forces the linker to copy
the output file to one of the same name with a @@code{.exe} suffix. This
option is useful when using unmodified Unix makefiles on a Microsoft
Windows host, since some versions of Windows won't run an image unless
it ends in a @@code{.exe} suffix.

@@kindex --gc-sections
@@kindex --no-gc-sections
@@cindex garbage collection
@@item --no-gc-sections
@@itemx --gc-sections
Enable garbage collection of unused input sections.  It is ignored on
targets that do not support this option.  This option is not compatible
with @@samp{-r}, nor should it be used with dynamic linking.  The default
behaviour (of not performing this garbage collection) can be restored by
specifying @@samp{--no-gc-sections} on the command line.

@@cindex help
@@cindex usage
@@kindex --help
@@item --help
Print a summary of the command-line options on the standard output and exit.

@@kindex --target-help
@@item --target-help
Print a summary of all target specific options on the standard output and exit.

@@kindex -Map
@@item -Map @@var{mapfile}
Print a link map to the file @@var{mapfile}.  See the description of the
@@option{-M} option, above.

@@cindex memory usage
@@kindex --no-keep-memory
@@item --no-keep-memory
@@command{ld} normally optimizes for speed over memory usage by caching the
symbol tables of input files in memory.  This option tells @@command{ld} to
instead optimize for memory usage, by rereading the symbol tables as
necessary.  This may be required if @@command{ld} runs out of memory space
while linking a large executable.

@@kindex --no-undefined
@@kindex -z defs
@@item --no-undefined
@@itemx -z defs
Report unresolved symbol references from regular object files.  This
is done even if the linker is creating a non-symbolic shared library.
The switch @@option{--[no-]allow-shlib-undefined} controls the
behaviour for reporting unresolved references found in shared
libraries being linked in.  

@@kindex --allow-multiple-definition
@@kindex -z muldefs
@@item --allow-multiple-definition
@@itemx -z muldefs
Normally when a symbol is defined multiple times, the linker will
report a fatal error. These options allow multiple definitions and the
first definition will be used.

@@kindex --allow-shlib-undefined
@@kindex --no-allow-shlib-undefined
@@item --allow-shlib-undefined
@@itemx --no-allow-shlib-undefined
Allows (the default) or disallows undefined symbols in shared libraries.
This switch is similar to @@option{--no-undefined} except that it
determines the behaviour when the undefined symbols are in a
shared library rather than a regular object file.  It does not affect
how undefined symbols in regular object files are handled.

The reason that @@option{--allow-shlib-undefined} is the default is that
the shared library being specified at link time may not be the same as
the one that is available at load time, so the symbols might actually be
resolvable at load time.  Plus there are some systems, (eg BeOS) where
undefined symbols in shared libraries is normal.  (The kernel patches
them at load time to select which function is most appropriate 
for the current architecture.  This is used for example to dynamically
select an appropriate memset function).  Apparently it is also normal
for HPPA shared libraries to have undefined symbols.

@@kindex --no-undefined-version
@@item --no-undefined-version
Normally when a symbol has an undefined version, the linker will ignore
it. This option disallows symbols with undefined version and a fatal error
will be issued instead.

should be configured to produce as a default output format the most

name of a particular format supported by the BFD libraries.  (You can
list the available binary formats with @@samp{objdump -i}.)  The script

@@ifset GENERIC
@@item -rpath @@var{dir}
@@cindex runtime library search path
@@kindex -rpath
Add a directory to the runtime library search path.  This is used when
linking an ELF executable with shared objects.  All @@option{-rpath}
arguments are concatenated and passed to the runtime linker, which uses
them to locate shared objects at runtime.  The @@option{-rpath} option is
also used when locating shared objects which are needed by shared
objects explicitly included in the link; see the description of the
@@option{-rpath-link} option.  If @@option{-rpath} is not used when linking an
ELF executable, the contents of the environment variable
@@code{LD_RUN_PATH} will be used if it is defined.

The @@option{-rpath} option may also be used on SunOS.  By default, on
SunOS, the linker will form a runtime search patch out of all the
@@option{-L} options it is given.  If a @@option{-rpath} option is used, the
runtime search path will be formed exclusively using the @@option{-rpath}
options, ignoring the @@option{-L} options.  This can be useful when using
gcc, which adds many @@option{-L} options which may be on NFS mounted
filesystems.

For compatibility with other ELF linkers, if the @@option{-R} option is
followed by a directory name, rather than a file name, it is treated as
the @@option{-rpath} option.

@@ifset GENERIC
@@cindex link-time runtime library search path
@@kindex -rpath-link
@@item -rpath-link @@var{DIR}
When using ELF or SunOS, one shared library may require another.  This
happens when an @@code{ld -shared} link includes a shared library as one
of the input files.

When the linker encounters such a dependency when doing a non-shared,
non-relocatable link, it will automatically try to locate the required
shared library and include it in the link, if it is not included
explicitly.  In such a case, the @@option{-rpath-link} option
specifies the first set of directories to search.  The
@@option{-rpath-link} option may specify a sequence of directory names
either by specifying a list of names separated by colons, or by
appearing multiple times.

This option should be used with caution as it overrides the search path
that may have been hard compiled into a shared library. In such a case it
is possible to use unintentionally a different search path than the
runtime linker would do.

The linker uses the following search paths to locate required shared
libraries.
@@enumerate
@@item
Any directories specified by @@option{-rpath-link} options.
@@item
Any directories specified by @@option{-rpath} options.  The difference
between @@option{-rpath} and @@option{-rpath-link} is that directories
specified by @@option{-rpath} options are included in the executable and
used at runtime, whereas the @@option{-rpath-link} option is only effective
at link time. It is for the native linker only.
@@item
On an ELF system, if the @@option{-rpath} and @@code{rpath-link} options
were not used, search the contents of the environment variable
@@code{LD_RUN_PATH}. It is for the native linker only.
@@item
On SunOS, if the @@option{-rpath} option was not used, search any
directories specified using @@option{-L} options.

For a native linker, the contents of the environment variable
@@code{LD_LIBRARY_PATH}.

For a native ELF linker, the directories in @@code{DT_RUNPATH} or

@@code{DT_RUNPATH} entries exist.

@@cindex shared libraries
Create a shared library.  This is currently only supported on ELF, XCOFF

shared library if the @@option{-e} option is not used and there are
undefined symbols in the link.

@@item --sort-common
@@kindex --sort-common
This option tells @@command{ld} to sort the common symbols by size when it
places them in the appropriate output sections.  First come all the one
byte symbols, then all the two byte, then all the four byte, and then
everything else.  This is to prevent gaps between symbols due to
alignment constraints.

@@kindex --split-by-file
@@item --split-by-file [@@var{size}]
Similar to @@option{--split-by-reloc} but creates a new output section for
each input file when @@var{size} is reached.  @@var{size} defaults to a
size of 1 if not given.

@@kindex --split-by-reloc
@@item --split-by-reloc [@@var{count}]
Tries to creates extra sections in the output file so that no single
output section in the file contains more than @@var{count} relocations.
This is useful when generating huge relocatable files for downloading into
certain real time kernels with the COFF object file format; since COFF
cannot represent more than 65535 relocations in a single section.  Note
that this will fail to work with object file formats which do not
support arbitrary sections.  The linker will not split up individual
input sections for redistribution, so if a single input section contains
more than @@var{count} relocations one output section will contain that
many relocations.  @@var{count} defaults to a value of 32768.

@@kindex --stats
@@item --stats
Compute and display statistics about the operation of the linker, such
as execution time and memory usage.

@@kindex --traditional-format
@@cindex traditional format
@@item --traditional-format
For some targets, the output of @@command{ld} is different in some ways from
the output of some existing linker.  This switch requests @@command{ld} to
use the traditional format instead.

@@cindex dbx
For example, on SunOS, @@command{ld} combines duplicate entries in the
symbol string table.  This can reduce the size of an output file with
full debugging information by over 30 percent.  Unfortunately, the SunOS
@@code{dbx} program can not read the resulting program (@@code{gdb} has no
trouble).  The @@samp{--traditional-format} switch tells @@command{ld} to not
combine duplicate entries.

@@kindex --section-start @@var{sectionname}=@@var{org}
@@item --section-start @@var{sectionname}=@@var{org}
Locate a section in the output file at the absolute
address given by @@var{org}.  You may use this option as many
times as necessary to locate multiple sections in the command
line.
@@var{org} must be a single hexadecimal integer;
for compatibility with other linkers, you may omit the leading
@@samp{0x} usually associated with hexadecimal values.  @@emph{Note:} there
should be no white space between @@var{sectionname}, the equals
sign (``@@key{=}''), and @@var{org}.

ignore them if they come from regular object files.

@@item ignore-in-shared-libs
Report unresolved symbols that come from regular object files, but
ignore them if they come from shared libraries.  This can be useful
when creating a dynamic binary and it is known that all the shared
libraries that it should be referencing are included on the linker's
command line.

The behaviour for shared libraries on their own can also be controlled
by the @@option{--[no-]allow-shlib-undefined} option.

@@xref{VERSION}.

@@kindex --warn-common
@@cindex warnings, on combining symbols
@@cindex combining symbols, warnings on
@@item --warn-common
Warn when a common symbol is combined with another common symbol or with
a symbol definition.  Unix linkers allow this somewhat sloppy practise,
but linkers on some other operating systems do not.  This option allows
you to find potential problems from combining global symbols.
Unfortunately, some C libraries use this practise, so you may get some
warnings about symbols in the libraries as well as in your programs.

There are three kinds of global symbols, illustrated here by C examples:

@@table @@samp
@@item int i = 1;
A definition, which goes in the initialized data section of the output
file.

@@item extern int i;
An undefined reference, which does not allocate space.
There must be either a definition or a common symbol for the
variable somewhere.

@@item int i;
A common symbol.  If there are only (one or more) common symbols for a
variable, it goes in the uninitialized data area of the output file.
The linker merges multiple common symbols for the same variable into a
single symbol.  If they are of different sizes, it picks the largest
size.  The linker turns a common symbol into a declaration, if there is
a definition of the same variable.
@@end table

The @@samp{--warn-common} option can produce five kinds of warnings.
Each warning consists of a pair of lines: the first describes the symbol
just encountered, and the second describes the previous symbol
encountered with the same name.  One or both of the two symbols will be
a common symbol.

@@enumerate
@@item
Turning a common symbol into a reference, because there is already a
definition for the symbol.
@@smallexample
@@var{file}(@@var{section}): warning: common of `@@var{symbol}'
   overridden by definition
@@var{file}(@@var{section}): warning: defined here

the symbol is encountered.  This is the same as the previous case,
except that the symbols are encountered in a different order.

@@end smallexample
@@end enumerate

@@kindex --warn-constructors
@@item --warn-constructors
Warn if any global constructors are used.  This is only useful for a few
object file formats.  For formats like COFF or ELF, the linker can not
detect the use of global constructors.

@@kindex --warn-multiple-gp
@@item --warn-multiple-gp
Warn if multiple global pointer values are required in the output file.
This is only meaningful for certain processors, such as the Alpha.
Specifically, some processors put large-valued constants in a special
section.  A special register (the global pointer) points into the middle
of this section, so that constants can be loaded efficiently via a
base-register relative addressing mode.  Since the offset in
base-register relative mode is fixed and relatively small (e.g., 16
bits), this limits the maximum size of the constant pool.  Thus, in
large programs, it is often necessary to use multiple global pointer
values in order to be able to address all possible constants.  This
option causes a warning to be issued whenever this case occurs.

@@kindex --warn-once
@@cindex warnings, on undefined symbols
@@cindex undefined symbols, warnings on
@@item --warn-once
Only warn once for each undefined symbol, rather than once per module
which refers to it.

@@kindex --warn-section-align
@@cindex warnings, on section alignment
@@cindex section alignment, warnings on
@@item --warn-section-align
Warn if the address of an output section is changed because of
alignment.  Typically, the alignment will be set by an input section.
The address will only be changed if it not explicitly specified; that
is, if the @@code{SECTIONS} command does not specify a start address for
the section (@@pxref{SECTIONS}).

@@kindex --warn-unresolved-symbols
@@item --warn-unresolved-symbols
If the linker is going to report an unresolved symbol (see the option
@@option{--unresolved-symbols}) it will normally generate an error.
This option makes it generate a warning instead.

@@kindex --error-unresolved-symbols
@@item --error-unresolved-symbols
This restores the linker's default behaviour of generating errors when
it is reporting unresolved symbols.

@@kindex --whole-archive
@@cindex including an entire archive
@@item --whole-archive
For each archive mentioned on the command line after the
@@option{--whole-archive} option, include every object file in the archive
in the link, rather than searching the archive for the required object
files.  This is normally used to turn an archive file into a shared
library, forcing every object to be included in the resulting shared
library.  This option may be used more than once.

Two notes when using this option from gcc: First, gcc doesn't know
about this option, so you have to use @@option{-Wl,-whole-archive}.
Second, don't forget to use @@option{-Wl,-no-whole-archive} after your
list of archives, because gcc will add its own list of archives to
your link and you may not want this flag to affect those as well.

@@kindex --wrap
@@item --wrap @@var{symbol}
Use a wrapper function for @@var{symbol}.  Any undefined reference to
@@var{symbol} will be resolved to @@code{__wrap_@@var{symbol}}.  Any
undefined reference to @@code{__real_@@var{symbol}} will be resolved to
@@var{symbol}.

This can be used to provide a wrapper for a system function.  The
wrapper function should be called @@code{__wrap_@@var{symbol}}.  If it
wishes to call the system function, it should call
@@code{__real_@@var{symbol}}.

Here is a trivial example:

@@smallexample
void *
__wrap_malloc (size_t c)
@@{
  printf ("malloc called with %zu\n", c);
  return __real_malloc (c);
@@}
@@end smallexample

If you link other code with this file using @@option{--wrap malloc}, then
all calls to @@code{malloc} will call the function @@code{__wrap_malloc}
instead.  The call to @@code{__real_malloc} in @@code{__wrap_malloc} will
call the real @@code{malloc} function.

You may wish to provide a @@code{__real_malloc} function as well, so that
links without the @@option{--wrap} option will succeed.  If you do this,
you should not put the definition of @@code{__real_malloc} in the same
file as @@code{__wrap_malloc}; if you do, the assembler may resolve the
call before the linker has a chance to wrap it to @@code{malloc}.

@@kindex --enable-new-dtags
@@kindex --disable-new-dtags
@@item --enable-new-dtags
@@itemx --disable-new-dtags
This linker can create the new dynamic tags in ELF. But the older ELF
systems may not understand them. If you specify
@@option{--enable-new-dtags}, the dynamic tags will be created as needed.
If you specify @@option{--disable-new-dtags}, no new dynamic tags will be
created. By default, the new dynamic tags are not created. Note that
those options are only available for ELF systems.

@@subsection Options Specific to i386 PE Targets

@@c man begin OPTIONS

The i386 PE linker supports the @@option{-shared} option, which causes
the output to be a dynamically linked library (DLL) instead of a
normal executable.  You should name the output @@code{*.dll} when you
use this option.  In addition, the linker fully supports the standard
@@code{*.def} files, which may be specified on the linker command line
like an object file (in fact, it should precede archives it exports
symbols from, to ensure that they get linked in, just like a normal
object file).

In addition to the options common to all targets, the i386 PE linker
support additional command line options that are specific to the i386
PE target.  Options that take values may be separated from their
values by either a space or an equals sign.

If the link finds a symbol that it cannot resolve, it will attempt to
do ``fuzzy linking'' by looking for another defined symbol that differs
only in the format of the symbol name (cdecl vs stdcall) and will
resolve that symbol by linking to the match.  For example, the
undefined symbol @@code{_foo} might be linked to the function
@@code{_foo@@@@12}, or the undefined symbol @@code{_bar@@@@16} might be linked
to the function @@code{_bar}.  When the linker does this, it prints a
warning, since it normally should have failed to link, but sometimes
import libraries generated from third-party dlls may need this feature
to be usable.  If you specify @@option{--enable-stdcall-fixup}, this
feature is fully enabled and warnings are not printed.  If you specify
@@option{--disable-stdcall-fixup}, this feature is disabled and such
mismatches are considered to be errors.

@@item --output-def @@var{file}
The linker will create the file @@var{file} which will contain a DEF
file corresponding to the DLL the linker is generating.  This DEF file
(which should be called @@code{*.def}) may be used to create an import
library with @@code{dlltool} or may be used as a reference to
automatically or implicitly exported symbols.

@@cindex DLLs, creating
@@kindex --out-implib
@@item --out-implib @@var{file}
The linker will create the file @@var{file} which will contain an
import lib corresponding to the DLL the linker is generating. This
import lib (which should be called @@code{*.dll.a} or @@code{*.a}
may be used to link clients against the generated DLL; this behaviour
makes it possible to skip a separate @@code{dlltool} import library
creation step.

@@kindex --enable-auto-image-base
@@item --enable-auto-image-base
Automatically choose the image base for DLLs, unless one is specified

from the dllname to create unique image bases for each DLL, in-memory
collisions and relocations which can delay program execution are
avoided.

@@code{lib<basename>.dll}. This behaviour allows easy distinction
between DLLs built for the various "subplatforms": native, cygwin,

@@kindex --enable-auto-import
@@item --enable-auto-import
Do sophisticated linking of @@code{_symbol} to @@code{__imp__symbol} for 
DATA imports from DLLs, and create the necessary thunking symbols when 
building the import libraries with those DATA exports. Note: Use of the
'auto-import' extension will cause the text section of the image file
to be made writable. This does not conform to the PE-COFF format
specification published by Microsoft.

Using 'auto-import' generally will 'just work' -- but sometimes you may
see this message:

"variable '<var>' can't be auto-imported. Please read the 
documentation for ld's @@code{--enable-auto-import} for details."

This message occurs when some (sub)expression accesses an address 
ultimately given by the sum of two constants (Win32 import tables only 
allow one).  Instances where this may occur include accesses to member 
fields of struct variables imported from a DLL, as well as using a 
constant index into an array variable imported from a DLL.  Any 
multiword variable (arrays, structs, long long, etc) may trigger
this error condition.  However, regardless of the exact data type
of the offending exported variable, ld will always detect it, issue
the warning, and exit.

There are several ways to address this difficulty, regardless of the
data type of the exported variable:

One way is to use --enable-runtime-pseudo-reloc switch. This leaves the task
of adjusting references in your client code for runtime environment, so
this method works only when runtime environment supports this feature.

A second solution is to force one of the 'constants' to be a variable -- 
that is, unknown and un-optimizable at compile time.  For arrays, 
there are two possibilities: a) make the indexee (the array's address) 
a variable, or b) make the 'constant' index a variable.  Thus:

@@example
extern type extern_array[];
extern_array[1] --> 
   @@{ volatile type *t=extern_array; t[1] @@}
@@end example

or

@@example
extern type extern_array[];
extern_array[1] --> 
   @@{ volatile int t=1; extern_array[t] @@}
@@end example

For structs (and most other multiword data types) the only option 
is to make the struct itself (or the long long, or the ...) variable:

@@example
extern struct s extern_struct;
extern_struct.field --> 
   @@{ volatile struct s *t=&extern_struct; t->field @@}
@@end example

or

@@example
extern long long extern_ll;
extern_ll -->
  @@{ volatile long long * local_ll=&extern_ll; *local_ll @@}
@@end example

A third method of dealing with this difficulty is to abandon
'auto-import' for the offending symbol and mark it with 
@@code{__declspec(dllimport)}.  However, in practise that
requires using compile-time #defines to indicate whether you are
building a DLL, building client code that will link to the DLL, or 
merely building/linking to a static library.   In making the choice 
between the various methods of resolving the 'direct address with 
constant offset' problem, you should consider typical real-world usage:

Original:
@@example
--foo.h
extern int arr[];
--foo.c
#include "foo.h"
void main(int argc, char **argv)@@{
  printf("%d\n",arr[1]);
@@}
@@end example

Solution 1:
@@example
--foo.h
extern int arr[];
--foo.c
#include "foo.h"
void main(int argc, char **argv)@@{
  /* This workaround is for win32 and cygwin; do not "optimize" */
  volatile int *parr = arr;
  printf("%d\n",parr[1]);
@@}
@@end example

Solution 2:
@@example
--foo.h
/* Note: auto-export is assumed (no __declspec(dllexport)) */
#if (defined(_WIN32) || defined(__CYGWIN__)) && \
  !(defined(FOO_BUILD_DLL) || defined(FOO_STATIC))
#define FOO_IMPORT __declspec(dllimport)
#else
#define FOO_IMPORT
#endif
extern FOO_IMPORT int arr[];
--foo.c
#include "foo.h"
void main(int argc, char **argv)@@{
  printf("%d\n",arr[1]);
@@}
@@end example

A fourth way to avoid this problem is to re-code your 
library to use a functional interface rather than a data interface
for the offending variables (e.g. set_foo() and get_foo() accessor
functions).

@@node Scripts
@@chapter Linker Scripts

@@cindex scripts
@@cindex linker scripts
@@cindex command files
Every link is controlled by a @@dfn{linker script}.  This script is
written in the linker command language.

The main purpose of the linker script is to describe how the sections in
the input files should be mapped into the output file, and to control
the memory layout of the output file.  Most linker scripts do nothing
more than this.  However, when necessary, the linker script can also
direct the linker to perform many other operations, using the commands
described below.

The linker always uses a linker script.  If you do not supply one
yourself, the linker will use a default script that is compiled into the
linker executable.  You can use the @@samp{--verbose} command line option
to display the default linker script.  Certain command line options,
such as @@samp{-r} or @@samp{-N}, will affect the default linker script.

You may supply your own linker script by using the @@samp{-T} command
line option.  When you do this, your linker script will replace the
default linker script.

You may also use linker scripts implicitly by naming them as input files
to the linker, as though they were files to be linked.  @@xref{Implicit
Linker Scripts}.

@@node Basic Script Concepts
@@section Basic Linker Script Concepts
@@cindex linker script concepts
We need to define some basic concepts and vocabulary in order to
describe the linker script language.

The linker combines input files into a single output file.  The output
file and each input file are in a special data format known as an
@@dfn{object file format}.  Each file is called an @@dfn{object file}.
The output file is often called an @@dfn{executable}, but for our
purposes we will also call it an object file.  Each object file has,
among other things, a list of @@dfn{sections}.  We sometimes refer to a
section in an input file as an @@dfn{input section}; similarly, a section
in the output file is an @@dfn{output section}.

Each section in an object file has a name and a size.  Most sections
also have an associated block of data, known as the @@dfn{section
contents}.  A section may be marked as @@dfn{loadable}, which mean that
the contents should be loaded into memory when the output file is run.
A section with no contents may be @@dfn{allocatable}, which means that an
area in memory should be set aside, but nothing in particular should be
loaded there (in some cases this memory must be zeroed out).  A section
which is neither loadable nor allocatable typically contains some sort
of debugging information.

Every loadable or allocatable output section has two addresses.  The
first is the @@dfn{VMA}, or virtual memory address.  This is the address
the section will have when the output file is run.  The second is the
@@dfn{LMA}, or load memory address.  This is the address at which the
section will be loaded.  In most cases the two addresses will be the
same.  An example of when they might be different is when a data section
is loaded into ROM, and then copied into RAM when the program starts up
(this technique is often used to initialize global variables in a ROM
based system).  In this case the ROM address would be the LMA, and the
RAM address would be the VMA.

You can see the sections in an object file by using the @@code{objdump}
program with the @@samp{-h} option.

Every object file also has a list of @@dfn{symbols}, known as the
@@dfn{symbol table}.  A symbol may be defined or undefined.  Each symbol
has a name, and each defined symbol has an address, among other
information.  If you compile a C or C++ program into an object file, you
will get a defined symbol for every defined function and global or
static variable.  Every undefined function or global variable which is
referenced in the input file will become an undefined symbol.

You can see the symbols in an object file by using the @@code{nm}
program, or by using the @@code{objdump} program with the @@samp{-t}
option.

@@node Script Format
@@section Linker Script Format
@@cindex linker script format
Linker scripts are text files.

You write a linker script as a series of commands.  Each command is
either a keyword, possibly followed by arguments, or an assignment to a
symbol.  You may separate commands using semicolons.  Whitespace is
generally ignored.

Strings such as file or format names can normally be entered directly.
If the file name contains a character such as a comma which would
otherwise serve to separate file names, you may put the file name in
double quotes.  There is no way to use a double quote character in a
file name.

You may include comments in linker scripts just as in C, delimited by
@@samp{/*} and @@samp{*/}.  As in C, comments are syntactically equivalent
to whitespace.

@@node Simple Example
@@section Simple Linker Script Example
@@cindex linker script example
@@cindex example of linker script
Many linker scripts are fairly simple.

The simplest possible linker script has just one command:
@@samp{SECTIONS}.  You use the @@samp{SECTIONS} command to describe the
memory layout of the output file.

The @@samp{SECTIONS} command is a powerful command.  Here we will
describe a simple use of it.  Let's assume your program consists only of
code, initialized data, and uninitialized data.  These will be in the
@@samp{.text}, @@samp{.data}, and @@samp{.bss} sections, respectively.
Let's assume further that these are the only sections which appear in
your input files.

For this example, let's say that the code should be loaded at address
0x10000, and that the data should start at address 0x8000000.  Here is a
linker script which will do that:
@@smallexample
SECTIONS
@@{
  . = 0x10000;
  .text : @@{ *(.text) @@}
  . = 0x8000000;
  .data : @@{ *(.data) @@}
  .bss : @@{ *(.bss) @@}
@@}
@@end smallexample

You write the @@samp{SECTIONS} command as the keyword @@samp{SECTIONS},
followed by a series of symbol assignments and output section
descriptions enclosed in curly braces.

The first line inside the @@samp{SECTIONS} command of the above example
sets the value of the special symbol @@samp{.}, which is the location
counter.  If you do not specify the address of an output section in some
other way (other ways are described later), the address is set from the
current value of the location counter.  The location counter is then
incremented by the size of the output section.  At the start of the
@@samp{SECTIONS} command, the location counter has the value @@samp{0}.

The second line defines an output section, @@samp{.text}.  The colon is
required syntax which may be ignored for now.  Within the curly braces
after the output section name, you list the names of the input sections
which should be placed into this output section.  The @@samp{*} is a
wildcard which matches any file name.  The expression @@samp{*(.text)}
means all @@samp{.text} input sections in all input files.

Since the location counter is @@samp{0x10000} when the output section
@@samp{.text} is defined, the linker will set the address of the
@@samp{.text} section in the output file to be @@samp{0x10000}.

The remaining lines define the @@samp{.data} and @@samp{.bss} sections in
the output file.  The linker will place the @@samp{.data} output section
at address @@samp{0x8000000}.  After the linker places the @@samp{.data}
output section, the value of the location counter will be
@@samp{0x8000000} plus the size of the @@samp{.data} output section.  The
effect is that the linker will place the @@samp{.bss} output section
immediately after the @@samp{.data} output section in memory

The linker will ensure that each output section has the required
alignment, by increasing the location counter if necessary.  In this
example, the specified addresses for the @@samp{.text} and @@samp{.data}
sections will probably satisfy any alignment constraints, but the linker
may have to create a small gap between the @@samp{.data} and @@samp{.bss}
sections.

That's it!  That's a simple and complete linker script.

@@node File Commands
@@subsection Commands Dealing with Files
@@cindex linker script file commands
Several linker script commands deal with files.

@@table @@code
@@item INCLUDE @@var{filename}
@@kindex INCLUDE @@var{filename}
@@cindex including a linker script
Include the linker script @@var{filename} at this point.  The file will
be searched for in the current directory, and in any directory specified
with the @@option{-L} option.  You can nest calls to @@code{INCLUDE} up to
10 levels deep.

@@item INPUT(@@var{file}, @@var{file}, @@dots{})
@@itemx INPUT(@@var{file} @@var{file} @@dots{})
@@kindex INPUT(@@var{files})
@@cindex input files in linker scripts
@@cindex input object files in linker scripts
@@cindex linker script input object files
The @@code{INPUT} command directs the linker to include the named files
in the link, as though they were named on the command line.

For example, if you always want to include @@file{subr.o} any time you do
a link, but you can't be bothered to put it on every link command line,
then you can put @@samp{INPUT (subr.o)} in your linker script.

In fact, if you like, you can list all of your input files in the linker
script, and then invoke the linker with nothing but a @@samp{-T} option.

In case a @@dfn{sysroot prefix} is configured, and the filename starts
with the @@samp{/} character, and the script being processed was
located inside the @@dfn{sysroot prefix}, the filename will be looked
for in the @@dfn{sysroot prefix}.  Otherwise, the linker will try to
open the file in the current directory.  If it is not found, the
linker will search through the archive library search path.  See the
description of @@samp{-L} in @@ref{Options,,Command Line Options}.

If you use @@samp{INPUT (-l@@var{file})}, @@command{ld} will transform the
name to @@code{lib@@var{file}.a}, as with the command line argument
@@samp{-l}.

When you use the @@code{INPUT} command in an implicit linker script, the
files will be included in the link at the point at which the linker
script file is included.  This can affect archive searching.

@@item GROUP(@@var{file}, @@var{file}, @@dots{})
@@itemx GROUP(@@var{file} @@var{file} @@dots{})
@@kindex GROUP(@@var{files})
@@cindex grouping input files
The @@code{GROUP} command is like @@code{INPUT}, except that the named
files should all be archives, and they are searched repeatedly until no
new undefined references are created.  See the description of @@samp{-(}
in @@ref{Options,,Command Line Options}.

@@item OUTPUT(@@var{filename})
@@kindex OUTPUT(@@var{filename})
@@cindex output file name in linker scripot
The @@code{OUTPUT} command names the output file.  Using
@@code{OUTPUT(@@var{filename})} in the linker script is exactly like using
@@samp{-o @@var{filename}} on the command line (@@pxref{Options,,Command
Line Options}).  If both are used, the command line option takes
precedence.

You can use the @@code{OUTPUT} command to define a default name for the
output file other than the usual default of @@file{a.out}.

@@item SEARCH_DIR(@@var{path})
@@kindex SEARCH_DIR(@@var{path})
@@cindex library search path in linker script
@@cindex archive search path in linker script
@@cindex search path in linker script
The @@code{SEARCH_DIR} command adds @@var{path} to the list of paths where
@@command{ld} looks for archive libraries.  Using
@@code{SEARCH_DIR(@@var{path})} is exactly like using @@samp{-L @@var{path}}
on the command line (@@pxref{Options,,Command Line Options}).  If both
are used, then the linker will search both paths.  Paths specified using
the command line option are searched first.

@@item STARTUP(@@var{filename})
@@kindex STARTUP(@@var{filename})
@@cindex first input file
The @@code{STARTUP} command is just like the @@code{INPUT} command, except
that @@var{filename} will become the first input file to be linked, as
though it were specified first on the command line.  This may be useful
when using a system in which the entry point is always the start of the
first file.
@@end table

@@ifclear SingleFormat
@@node Format Commands
@@subsection Commands Dealing with Object File Formats
A couple of linker script commands deal with object file formats.

@@table @@code
@@item OUTPUT_FORMAT(@@var{bfdname})
@@itemx OUTPUT_FORMAT(@@var{default}, @@var{big}, @@var{little})
@@kindex OUTPUT_FORMAT(@@var{bfdname})
@@cindex output file format in linker script
The @@code{OUTPUT_FORMAT} command names the BFD format to use for the
output file (@@pxref{BFD}).  Using @@code{OUTPUT_FORMAT(@@var{bfdname})} is
exactly like using @@samp{--oformat @@var{bfdname}} on the command line
(@@pxref{Options,,Command Line Options}).  If both are used, the command
line option takes precedence.

You can use @@code{OUTPUT_FORMAT} with three arguments to use different
formats based on the @@samp{-EB} and @@samp{-EL} command line options.
This permits the linker script to set the output format based on the
desired endianness.

If neither @@samp{-EB} nor @@samp{-EL} are used, then the output format
will be the first argument, @@var{default}.  If @@samp{-EB} is used, the
output format will be the second argument, @@var{big}.  If @@samp{-EL} is
used, the output format will be the third argument, @@var{little}.

For example, the default linker script for the MIPS ELF target uses this
command:
@@smallexample
OUTPUT_FORMAT(elf32-bigmips, elf32-bigmips, elf32-littlemips)
@@end smallexample
This says that the default format for the output file is
@@samp{elf32-bigmips}, but if the user uses the @@samp{-EL} command line
option, the output file will be created in the @@samp{elf32-littlemips}
format.

@@item TARGET(@@var{bfdname})
@@kindex TARGET(@@var{bfdname})
@@cindex input file format in linker script
The @@code{TARGET} command names the BFD format to use when reading input
files.  It affects subsequent @@code{INPUT} and @@code{GROUP} commands.
This command is like using @@samp{-b @@var{bfdname}} on the command line
(@@pxref{Options,,Command Line Options}).  If the @@code{TARGET} command
is used but @@code{OUTPUT_FORMAT} is not, then the last @@code{TARGET}
command is also used to set the format for the output file.  @@xref{BFD}.

@@node Miscellaneous Commands
@@subsection Other Linker Script Commands
There are a few other linker scripts commands.

@@table @@code
@@item ASSERT(@@var{exp}, @@var{message})
@@kindex ASSERT
@@cindex assertion in linker script
Ensure that @@var{exp} is non-zero.  If it is zero, then exit the linker
with an error code, and print @@var{message}.

@@item EXTERN(@@var{symbol} @@var{symbol} @@dots{})
@@kindex EXTERN
@@cindex undefined symbol in linker script
Force @@var{symbol} to be entered in the output file as an undefined
symbol.  Doing this may, for example, trigger linking of additional
modules from standard libraries.  You may list several @@var{symbol}s for
each @@code{EXTERN}, and you may use @@code{EXTERN} multiple times.  This
command has the same effect as the @@samp{-u} command-line option.

@@item FORCE_COMMON_ALLOCATION
@@kindex FORCE_COMMON_ALLOCATION
@@cindex common allocation in linker script
This command has the same effect as the @@samp{-d} command-line option:
to make @@command{ld} assign space to common symbols even if a relocatable
output file is specified (@@samp{-r}).

@@item INHIBIT_COMMON_ALLOCATION
@@kindex INHIBIT_COMMON_ALLOCATION
@@cindex common allocation in linker script
This command has the same effect as the @@samp{--no-define-common}
command-line option: to make @@code{ld} omit the assignment of addresses
to common symbols even for a non-relocatable output file.

@@item NOCROSSREFS(@@var{section} @@var{section} @@dots{})
@@kindex NOCROSSREFS(@@var{sections})
@@cindex cross references
This command may be used to tell @@command{ld} to issue an error about any
references among certain output sections.

In certain types of programs, particularly on embedded systems when
using overlays, when one section is loaded into memory, another section
will not be.  Any direct references between the two sections would be
errors.  For example, it would be an error if code in one section called

The @@code{NOCROSSREFS} command takes a list of output section names.  If
@@command{ld} detects any cross references between the sections, it reports
an error and returns a non-zero exit status.  Note that the

@@subsection Simple Assignments

You may assign to a symbol using any of the C assignment operators:

@@table @@code
@@item @@var{symbol} = @@var{expression} ;
@@itemx @@var{symbol} += @@var{expression} ;
@@itemx @@var{symbol} -= @@var{expression} ;
@@itemx @@var{symbol} *= @@var{expression} ;
@@itemx @@var{symbol} /= @@var{expression} ;
@@itemx @@var{symbol} <<= @@var{expression} ;
@@itemx @@var{symbol} >>= @@var{expression} ;
@@itemx @@var{symbol} &= @@var{expression} ;
@@itemx @@var{symbol} |= @@var{expression} ;
@@end table

The first case will define @@var{symbol} to the value of
@@var{expression}.  In the other cases, @@var{symbol} must already be
defined, and the value will be adjusted accordingly.

The special symbol name @@samp{.} indicates the location counter.  You
may only use this within a @@code{SECTIONS} command.

The semicolon after @@var{expression} is required.

Expressions are defined below; see @@ref{Expressions}.

You may write symbol assignments as commands in their own right, or as
statements within a @@code{SECTIONS} command, or as part of an output
section description in a @@code{SECTIONS} command.

The section of the symbol will be set from the section of the
expression; for more information, see @@ref{Expression Section}.

Here is an example showing the three different places that symbol
assignments may be used:

@@smallexample
floating_point = 0;
SECTIONS
@@{
  .text :
    @@{
      *(.text)
      _etext = .;
    @@}
  _bdata = (. + 3) & ~ 3;
  .data : @@{ *(.data) @@}
@@}
@@end smallexample
@@noindent
In this example, the symbol @@samp{floating_point} will be defined as
zero.  The symbol @@samp{_etext} will be defined as the address following
the last @@samp{.text} input section.  The symbol @@samp{_bdata} will be
defined as the address following the @@samp{.text} output section aligned
upward to a 4 byte boundary.

@@node PROVIDE
@@subsection PROVIDE
@@cindex PROVIDE
In some cases, it is desirable for a linker script to define a symbol
only if it is referenced and is not defined by any object included in
the link.  For example, traditional linkers defined the symbol
@@samp{etext}.  However, ANSI C requires that the user be able to use
@@samp{etext} as a function name without encountering an error.  The
@@code{PROVIDE} keyword may be used to define a symbol, such as
@@samp{etext}, only if it is referenced but not defined.  The syntax is
@@code{PROVIDE(@@var{symbol} = @@var{expression})}.

Here is an example of using @@code{PROVIDE} to define @@samp{etext}:
@@smallexample
SECTIONS
@@{
  .text :
    @@{
      *(.text)
      _etext = .;
      PROVIDE(etext = .);
    @@}
@@}
@@end smallexample

In this example, if the program defines @@samp{_etext} (with a leading
underscore), the linker will give a multiple definition error.  If, on
the other hand, the program defines @@samp{etext} (with no leading
underscore), the linker will silently use the definition in the program.
If the program references @@samp{etext} but does not define it, the
linker will use the definition in the linker script.

@@node SECTIONS
@@section SECTIONS Command
@@kindex SECTIONS
The @@code{SECTIONS} command tells the linker how to map input sections
into output sections, and how to place the output sections in memory.

The format of the @@code{SECTIONS} command is:
@@smallexample
SECTIONS
@@{
  @@var{sections-command}
  @@var{sections-command}
  @@dots{}
@@}
@@end smallexample

Each @@var{sections-command} may of be one of the following:

@@itemize @@bullet
@@item
an @@code{ENTRY} command (@@pxref{Entry Point,,Entry command})
@@item
a symbol assignment (@@pxref{Assignments})
@@item
an output section description
@@item
an overlay description
@@end itemize

The @@code{ENTRY} command and symbol assignments are permitted inside the
@@code{SECTIONS} command for convenience in using the location counter in
those commands.  This can also make the linker script easier to
understand because you can use those commands at meaningful points in
the layout of the output file.

Output section descriptions and overlay descriptions are described
below.

If you do not use a @@code{SECTIONS} command in your linker script, the
linker will place each input section into an identically named output
section in the order that the sections are first encountered in the
input files.  If all input sections are present in the first file, for
example, the order of sections in the output file will match the order
in the first input file.  The first section will be at address zero.

Most output sections do not use most of the optional section attributes.

The whitespace around @@var{section} is required, so that the section

The line breaks and other white space are optional.

Each @@var{output-section-command} may be one of the following:

@@node Output Section Name
@@subsection Output Section Name
@@cindex name, section
@@cindex section name
The name of the output section is @@var{section}.  @@var{section} must
meet the constraints of your output format.  In formats which only
support a limited number of sections, such as @@code{a.out}, the name
must be one of the names supported by the format (@@code{a.out}, for
example, allows only @@samp{.text}, @@samp{.data} or @@samp{.bss}). If the
output format supports any number of sections, but with numbers and not
names (as is the case for Oasys), the name should be supplied as a
quoted numeric string.  A section name may consist of any sequence of
characters, but a name which contains any unusual characters such as
commas must be quoted.

The output section name @@samp{/DISCARD/} is special; @@ref{Output Section
Discarding}.

@@node Output Section Address
@@subsection Output Section Description
@@cindex address, section
@@cindex section address
The @@var{address} is an expression for the VMA (the virtual memory
address) of the output section.  If you do not provide @@var{address},
the linker will set it based on @@var{region} if present, or otherwise
based on the current value of the location counter.

If you provide @@var{address}, the address of the output section will be
set to precisely that.  If you provide neither @@var{address} nor
@@var{region}, then the address of the output section will be set to the
current value of the location counter aligned to the alignment
requirements of the output section.  The alignment requirement of the
output section is the strictest alignment of any input section contained
within the output section.

For example,
@@smallexample
.text . : @@{ *(.text) @@}
@@end smallexample
@@noindent
and
@@smallexample
.text : @@{ *(.text) @@}
@@end smallexample
@@noindent
are subtly different.  The first will set the address of the
@@samp{.text} output section to the current value of the location
counter.  The second will set it to the current value of the location
counter aligned to the strictest alignment of a @@samp{.text} input
section.

The @@var{address} may be an arbitrary expression; @@ref{Expressions}.
For example, if you want to align the section on a 0x10 byte boundary,
so that the lowest four bits of the section address are zero, you could
do something like this:
@@smallexample
.text ALIGN(0x10) : @@{ *(.text) @@}
@@end smallexample
@@noindent
This works because @@code{ALIGN} returns the current location counter
aligned upward to the specified value.

Specifying @@var{address} for a section will change the value of the
location counter.

@@node Input Section
@@subsection Input Section Description
@@cindex input sections
@@cindex mapping input sections to output sections
The most common output section command is an input section description.

The input section description is the most basic linker script operation.
You use output sections to tell the linker how to lay out your program
in memory.  You use input section descriptions to tell the linker how to
map the input files into your memory layout.

@@node Input Section Basics
@@subsubsection Input Section Basics
@@cindex input section basics
An input section description consists of a file name optionally followed
by a list of section names in parentheses.

The file name and the section name may be wildcard patterns, which we
describe further below (@@pxref{Input Section Wildcards}).

The most common input section description is to include all input
sections with a particular name in the output section.  For example, to
include all input @@samp{.text} sections, you would write:
@@smallexample
*(.text)
@@end smallexample
@@noindent
Here the @@samp{*} is a wildcard which matches any file name.  To exclude a list
of files from matching the file name wildcard, EXCLUDE_FILE may be used to
match all files except the ones specified in the EXCLUDE_FILE list.  For
example:
@@smallexample
(*(EXCLUDE_FILE (*crtend.o *otherfile.o) .ctors))
@@end smallexample
will cause all .ctors sections from all files except @@file{crtend.o} and
@@file{otherfile.o} to be included.

There are two ways to include more than one section:
@@smallexample
*(.text .rdata)
*(.text) *(.rdata)
@@end smallexample
@@noindent
The difference between these is the order in which the @@samp{.text} and
@@samp{.rdata} input sections will appear in the output section.  In the
first example, they will be intermingled, appearing in the same order as
they are found in the linker input.  In the second example, all
@@samp{.text} input sections will appear first, followed by all
@@samp{.rdata} input sections.

You can specify a file name to include sections from a particular file.
You would do this if one or more of your files contain special data that
needs to be at a particular location in memory.  For example:
@@smallexample
data.o(.data)
@@end smallexample

If you use a file name without a list of sections, then all sections in
the input file will be included in the output section.  This is not
commonly done, but it may by useful on occasion.  For example:
@@smallexample
data.o
@@end smallexample

When you use a file name which does not contain any wild card
characters, the linker will first see if you also specified the file
name on the linker command line or in an @@code{INPUT} command.  If you
did not, the linker will attempt to open the file as an input file, as
though it appeared on the command line.  Note that this differs from an
@@code{INPUT} command, because the linker will not search for the file in
the archive search path.

@@node Input Section Wildcards
@@subsubsection Input Section Wildcard Patterns
@@cindex input section wildcards
@@cindex wildcard file name patterns
@@cindex file name wildcard patterns
@@cindex section name wildcard patterns
In an input section description, either the file name or the section
name or both may be wildcard patterns.

The file name of @@samp{*} seen in many examples is a simple wildcard
pattern for the file name.

The wildcard patterns are like those used by the Unix shell.

@@table @@samp
@@item *
matches any number of characters
@@item ?
matches any single character
@@item [@@var{chars}]
matches a single instance of any of the @@var{chars}; the @@samp{-}
character may be used to specify a range of characters, as in
@@samp{[a-z]} to match any lower case letter
@@item \
quotes the following character
@@end table

When a file name is matched with a wildcard, the wildcard characters
will not match a @@samp{/} character (used to separate directory names on
Unix).  A pattern consisting of a single @@samp{*} character is an
exception; it will always match any file name, whether it contains a
@@samp{/} or not.  In a section name, the wildcard characters will match
a @@samp{/} character.

File name wildcard patterns only match files which are explicitly
specified on the command line or in an @@code{INPUT} command.  The linker
does not search directories to expand wildcards.

If a file name matches more than one wildcard pattern, or if a file name
appears explicitly and is also matched by a wildcard pattern, the linker
will use the first match in the linker script.  For example, this
sequence of input section descriptions is probably in error, because the
@@file{data.o} rule will not be used:
@@smallexample
.data : @@{ *(.data) @@}
.data1 : @@{ data.o(.data) @@}
@@end smallexample

@@cindex SORT
Normally, the linker will place files and sections matched by wildcards
in the order in which they are seen during the link.  You can change
this by using the @@code{SORT} keyword, which appears before a wildcard
pattern in parentheses (e.g., @@code{SORT(.text*)}).  When the
@@code{SORT} keyword is used, the linker will sort the files or sections
into ascending order by name before placing them in the output file.

If you ever get confused about where input sections are going, use the
@@samp{-M} linker option to generate a map file.  The map file shows
precisely how input sections are mapped to output sections.

This example shows how wildcard patterns might be used to partition
files.  This linker script directs the linker to place all @@samp{.text}
sections in @@samp{.text} and all @@samp{.bss} sections in @@samp{.bss}.
The linker will place the @@samp{.data} section from all files beginning
with an upper case character in @@samp{.DATA}; for all other files, the
linker will place the @@samp{.data} section in @@samp{.data}.

@@node Input Section Common
@@subsubsection Input Section for Common Symbols
@@cindex common symbol placement
@@cindex uninitialized data placement
A special notation is needed for common symbols, because in many object
file formats common symbols do not have a particular input section.  The
linker treats common symbols as though they are in an input section
named @@samp{COMMON}.

You may use file names with the @@samp{COMMON} section just as with any
other input sections.  You can use this to place common symbols from a
particular input file in one section while common symbols from other
input files are placed in another section.

In most cases, common symbols in input files will be placed in the
@@samp{.bss} section in the output file.  For example:
@@smallexample
.bss @@{ *(.bss) *(COMMON) @@}
@@end smallexample

@@cindex scommon section
@@cindex small common symbols
Some object file formats have more than one type of common symbol.  For
example, the MIPS ELF object file format distinguishes standard common
symbols and small common symbols.  In this case, the linker will use a
different special section name for other types of common symbols.  In
the case of MIPS ELF, the linker uses @@samp{COMMON} for standard common
symbols and @@samp{.scommon} for small common symbols.  This permits you
to map the different types of common symbols into memory at different
locations.

@@cindex [COMMON]
You will sometimes see @@samp{[COMMON]} in old linker scripts.  This
notation is now considered obsolete.  It is equivalent to
@@samp{*(COMMON)}.

@@node Input Section Keep
@@subsubsection Input Section and Garbage Collection
@@cindex KEEP
@@cindex garbage collection
When link-time garbage collection is in use (@@samp{--gc-sections}),
it is often useful to mark sections that should not be eliminated.
This is accomplished by surrounding an input section's wildcard entry
with @@code{KEEP()}, as in @@code{KEEP(*(.init))} or
@@code{KEEP(SORT(*)(.ctors))}.

@@node Input Section Example
@@subsubsection Input Section Example
The following example is a complete linker script.  It tells the linker
to read all of the sections from file @@file{all.o} and place them at the
start of output section @@samp{outputa} which starts at location
@@samp{0x10000}.  All of section @@samp{.input1} from file @@file{foo.o}
follows immediately, in the same output section.  All of section
@@samp{.input2} from @@file{foo.o} goes into output section
@@samp{outputb}, followed by section @@samp{.input1} from @@file{foo1.o}.
All of the remaining @@samp{.input1} and @@samp{.input2} sections from any

@@kindex SHORT(@@var{expression})
@@kindex LONG(@@var{expression})
@@kindex QUAD(@@var{expression})
@@kindex SQUAD(@@var{expression})
You can include explicit bytes of data in an output section by using
@@code{BYTE}, @@code{SHORT}, @@code{LONG}, @@code{QUAD}, or @@code{SQUAD} as
an output section command.  Each keyword is followed by an expression in
parentheses providing the value to store (@@pxref{Expressions}).  The
value of the expression is stored at the current value of the location
counter.

The @@code{BYTE}, @@code{SHORT}, @@code{LONG}, and @@code{QUAD} commands
store one, two, four, and eight bytes (respectively).  After storing the
bytes, the location counter is incremented by the number of bytes
stored.

For example, this will store the byte 1 followed by the four byte value
of the symbol @@samp{addr}:
@@smallexample
BYTE(1)
LONG(addr)
@@end smallexample

When using a 64 bit host or target, @@code{QUAD} and @@code{SQUAD} are the
same; they both store an 8 byte, or 64 bit, value.  When both host and
target are 32 bits, an expression is computed as 32 bits.  In this case
@@code{QUAD} stores a 32 bit value zero extended to 64 bits, and
@@code{SQUAD} stores a 32 bit value sign extended to 64 bits.

If the object file format of the output file has an explicit endianness,
which is the normal case, the value will be stored in that endianness.
When the object file format does not have an explicit endianness, as is
true of, for example, S-records, the value will be stored in the
endianness of the first input object file.

Note---these commands only work inside a section description and not
between them, so the following will produce an error from the linker:
@@smallexample

@@kindex FILL(@@var{expression})

@@cindex unspecified memory
You may use the @@code{FILL} command to set the fill pattern for the
current section.  It is followed by an expression in parentheses.  Any
otherwise unspecified regions of memory within the section (for example,
gaps left due to the required alignment of input sections) are filled
with the value of the expression, repeated as
necessary.  A @@code{FILL} statement covers memory locations after the
point at which it occurs in the section definition; by including more
than one @@code{FILL} statement, you can have different fill patterns in
different parts of an output section.

This example shows how to fill unspecified regions of memory with the
value @@samp{0x90}:
@@smallexample
FILL(0x90909090)
@@end smallexample

The @@code{FILL} command is similar to the @@samp{=@@var{fillexp}} output
section attribute, but it only affects the
part of the section following the @@code{FILL} command, rather than the
entire section.  If both are used, the @@code{FILL} command takes
precedence.  @@xref{Output Section Fill}, for details on the fill

There are a couple of keywords which can appear as output section

@@table @@code
@@kindex CREATE_OBJECT_SYMBOLS
@@cindex input filename symbols
@@cindex filename symbols
@@item CREATE_OBJECT_SYMBOLS
The command tells the linker to create a symbol for each input file.
The name of each symbol will be the name of the corresponding input
file.  The section of each symbol will be the output section in which
the @@code{CREATE_OBJECT_SYMBOLS} command appears.

This is conventional for the a.out object file format.  It is not
normally used for any other object file format.

@@kindex CONSTRUCTORS
@@cindex C++ constructors, arranging in link
@@cindex constructors, arranging in link
@@item CONSTRUCTORS
When linking using the a.out object file format, the linker uses an
unusual set construct to support C++ global constructors and
destructors.  When linking object file formats which do not support
arbitrary sections, such as ECOFF and XCOFF, the linker will
automatically recognize C++ global constructors and destructors by name.
For these object file formats, the @@code{CONSTRUCTORS} command tells the
linker to place constructor information in the output section where the
@@code{CONSTRUCTORS} command appears.  The @@code{CONSTRUCTORS} command is
ignored for other object file formats.

The symbol @@w{@@code{__CTOR_LIST__}} marks the start of the global
constructors, and the symbol @@w{@@code{__DTOR_LIST}} marks the end.  The
first word in the list is the number of entries, followed by the address
of each constructor or destructor, followed by a zero word.  The
compiler must arrange to actually run the code.  For these object file
formats @@sc{gnu} C++ normally calls constructors from a subroutine
@@code{__main}; a call to @@code{__main} is automatically inserted into
the startup code for @@code{main}.  @@sc{gnu} C++ normally runs
destructors either by using @@code{atexit}, or directly from the function
@@code{exit}.

For object file formats such as @@code{COFF} or @@code{ELF} which support
arbitrary section names, @@sc{gnu} C++ will normally arrange to put the
addresses of global constructors and destructors into the @@code{.ctors}
and @@code{.dtors} sections.  Placing the following sequence into your
linker script will build the sort of table which the @@sc{gnu} C++
runtime code expects to see.

@@smallexample
      __CTOR_LIST__ = .;
      LONG((__CTOR_END__ - __CTOR_LIST__) / 4 - 2)
      *(.ctors)
      LONG(0)
      __CTOR_END__ = .;
      __DTOR_LIST__ = .;
      LONG((__DTOR_END__ - __DTOR_LIST__) / 4 - 2)
      *(.dtors)
      LONG(0)
      __DTOR_END__ = .;
@@end smallexample

If you are using the @@sc{gnu} C++ support for initialization priority,
which provides some control over the order in which global constructors
are run, you must sort the constructors at link time to ensure that they
are executed in the correct order.  When using the @@code{CONSTRUCTORS}
command, use @@samp{SORT(CONSTRUCTORS)} instead.  When using the
@@code{.ctors} and @@code{.dtors} sections, use @@samp{*(SORT(.ctors))} and
@@samp{*(SORT(.dtors))} instead of just @@samp{*(.ctors)} and
@@samp{*(.dtors)}.

Normally the compiler and linker will handle these issues automatically,
and you will not need to concern yourself with them.  However, you may
need to consider this if you are using C++ and writing your own linker
scripts.

the section type.  For example, in the script sample below, the
@@samp{ROM} section is addressed at memory location @@samp{0} and does not
need to be loaded when the program is run.  The contents of the
@@samp{ROM} section will appear in the linker output file as usual.

Every section has a virtual address (VMA) and a load address (LMA); see

an output section description sets the VMA (@@pxref{Output Section

The linker will normally set the LMA equal to the VMA.  You can change
that by using the @@code{AT} keyword.  The expression @@var{lma} that
follows the @@code{AT} keyword specifies the load address of the
section.

Alternatively, with @@samp{AT>@@var{lma_region}} expression, you may
specify a memory region for the section's load address. @@xref{MEMORY}.
Note that if the section has not had a VMA assigned to it then the
linker will use the @@var{lma_region} as the VMA region as well.

This feature is designed to make it easy to build a ROM image.  For

even though its VMA is @@code{0x2000}, and one called @@samp{.bss} to hold
uninitialized data at address @@code{0x3000}.  The symbol @@code{_data} is

@@node Overlay Description
@@subsection Overlay Description
@@kindex OVERLAY
@@cindex overlays
An overlay description provides an easy way to describe sections which
are to be loaded as part of a single memory image but are to be run at
the same memory address.  At run time, some sort of overlay manager will
copy the overlaid sections in and out of the runtime memory address as
required, perhaps by simply manipulating addressing bits.  This approach
can be useful, for example, when a certain region of memory is faster
than another.

Overlays are described using the @@code{OVERLAY} command.  The
@@code{OVERLAY} command is used within a @@code{SECTIONS} command, like an
output section description.  The full syntax of the @@code{OVERLAY}
command is as follows:
@@smallexample
@@group
OVERLAY [@@var{start}] : [NOCROSSREFS] [AT ( @@var{ldaddr} )]
  @@{
    @@var{secname1}

  @@} [>@@var{region}] [:@@var{phdr}@@dots{}] [=@@var{fill}]
@@end group
@@end smallexample

Everything is optional except @@code{OVERLAY} (a keyword), and each
section must have a name (@@var{secname1} and @@var{secname2} above).  The
section definitions within the @@code{OVERLAY} construct are identical to
those within the general @@code{SECTIONS} contruct (@@pxref{SECTIONS}),
except that no addresses and no memory regions may be defined for
sections within an @@code{OVERLAY}.

The sections are all defined with the same starting address.  The load
addresses of the sections are arranged such that they are consecutive in
memory starting at the load address used for the @@code{OVERLAY} as a
whole (as with normal section definitions, the load address is optional,
and defaults to the start address; the start address is also optional,
and defaults to the current value of the location counter).

If the @@code{NOCROSSREFS} keyword is used, and there any references
among the sections, the linker will report an error.  Since the sections
all run at the same address, it normally does not make sense for one
section to refer directly to another.  @@xref{Miscellaneous Commands,
NOCROSSREFS}.

For each section within the @@code{OVERLAY}, the linker automatically
defines two symbols.  The symbol @@code{__load_start_@@var{secname}} is
defined as the starting load address of the section.  The symbol
@@code{__load_stop_@@var{secname}} is defined as the final load address of
the section.  Any characters within @@var{secname} which are not legal
within C identifiers are removed.  C (or assembler) code may use these
symbols to move the overlaid sections around as necessary.

At the end of the overlay, the value of the location counter is set to
the start address of the overlay plus the size of the largest section.

Here is an example.  Remember that this would appear inside a
@@code{SECTIONS} construct.

@@node MEMORY
@@section MEMORY Command
@@kindex MEMORY
@@cindex memory regions
@@cindex regions of memory
@@cindex allocating memory
@@cindex discontinuous memory
The linker's default configuration permits allocation of all available
memory.  You can override this by using the @@code{MEMORY} command.

The @@code{MEMORY} command describes the location and size of blocks of
memory in the target.  You can use it to describe which memory regions
may be used by the linker, and which memory regions it must avoid.  You
can then assign sections to particular memory regions.  The linker will
set section addresses based on the memory regions, and will warn about
regions that become too full.  The linker will not shuffle sections
around to fit into the available regions.

A linker script may contain at most one use of the @@code{MEMORY}
command.  However, you can define as many blocks of memory within it as
you wish.  The syntax is:
@@smallexample
@@group
MEMORY
  @@{
    @@var{name} [(@@var{attr})] : ORIGIN = @@var{origin}, LENGTH = @@var{len}
    @@dots{}
  @@}
@@end group
@@end smallexample

The @@var{name} is a name used in the linker script to refer to the
region.  The region name has no meaning outside of the linker script.
Region names are stored in a separate name space, and will not conflict
with symbol names, file names, or section names.  Each memory region
must have a distinct name.

@@cindex memory region attributes
The @@var{attr} string is an optional list of attributes that specify
whether to use a particular memory region for an input section which is
not explicitly mapped in the linker script.  As described in
@@ref{SECTIONS}, if you do not specify an output section for some input
section, the linker will create an output section with the same name as
the input section.  If you define region attributes, the linker will use
them to select the memory region for the output section that it creates.

The @@var{attr} string must consist only of the following characters:
@@table @@samp
@@item R
Read-only section
@@item W
Read/write section
@@item X
Executable section
@@item A
Allocatable section
@@item I
Initialized section
@@item L
Same as @@samp{I}
@@item !
Invert the sense of any of the preceding attributes
@@end table

If a unmapped section matches any of the listed attributes other than
@@samp{!}, it will be placed in the memory region.  The @@samp{!}
attribute reverses this test, so that an unmapped section will be placed
in the memory region only if it does not match any of the listed
attributes.

@@kindex ORIGIN =
@@kindex o =
@@kindex org =
The @@var{origin} is an expression for the start address of the memory
region.  The expression must evaluate to a constant before memory
allocation is performed, which means that you may not use any section
relative symbols.  The keyword @@code{ORIGIN} may be abbreviated to
@@code{org} or @@code{o} (but not, for example, @@code{ORG}).

@@kindex LENGTH =
@@kindex len =
@@kindex l =
The @@var{len} is an expression for the size in bytes of the memory
region.  As with the @@var{origin} expression, the expression must
evaluate to a constant before memory allocation is performed.  The
keyword @@code{LENGTH} may be abbreviated to @@code{len} or @@code{l}.

In the following example, we specify that there are two memory regions
available for allocation: one starting at @@samp{0} for 256 kilobytes,
and the other starting at @@samp{0x40000000} for four megabytes.  The
linker will place into the @@samp{rom} memory region every section which
is not explicitly mapped into a memory region, and is either read-only
or executable.  The linker will place other sections which are not
explicitly mapped into a memory region into the @@samp{ram} memory
region.

@@end smallexample

Once you define a memory region, you can direct the linker to place
specific output sections into that memory region by using the
@@samp{>@@var{region}} output section attribute.  For example, if you have
a memory region named @@samp{mem}, you would use @@samp{>mem} in the
output section definition.  @@xref{Output Section Region}.  If no address
was specified for the output section, the linker will set the address to
the next available address within the memory region.  If the combined
output sections directed to a memory region are too large for the
region, the linker will issue an error message.

@@kindex PHDRS
@@cindex program headers
@@cindex ELF program headers
@@cindex program segments
@@cindex segments, ELF
The ELF object file format uses @@dfn{program headers}, also knows as
@@dfn{segments}.  The program headers describe how the program should be
loaded into memory.  You can print them out by using the @@code{objdump}
program with the @@samp{-p} option.

When you run an ELF program on a native ELF system, the system loader
reads the program headers in order to figure out how to load the
program.  This will only work if the program headers are set correctly.
This manual does not describe the details of how the system loader
interprets program headers; for more information, see the ELF ABI.

The linker will create reasonable program headers by default.  However,
in some cases, you may need to specify the program headers more
precisely.  You may use the @@code{PHDRS} command for this purpose.  When
the linker sees the @@code{PHDRS} command in the linker script, it will
not create any program headers other than the ones specified.

The linker only pays attention to the @@code{PHDRS} command when
generating an ELF output file.  In other cases, the linker will simply
ignore @@code{PHDRS}.

This is the syntax of the @@code{PHDRS} command.  The words @@code{PHDRS},
@@code{FILEHDR}, @@code{AT}, and @@code{FLAGS} are keywords.

@@smallexample

@@end group
@@end smallexample

The @@var{name} is used only for reference in the @@code{SECTIONS} command
of the linker script.  It is not put into the output file.  Program
header names are stored in a separate name space, and will not conflict
with symbol names, file names, or section names.  Each program header
must have a distinct name.

Certain program header types describe segments of memory which the
system loader will load from the file.  In the linker script, you
specify the contents of these segments by placing allocatable output
sections in the segments.  You use the @@samp{:@@var{phdr}} output section
attribute to place a section in a particular segment.  @@xref{Output
Section Phdr}.

It is normal to put certain sections in more than one segment.  This
merely implies that one segment of memory contains another.  You may
repeat @@samp{:@@var{phdr}}, using it once for each segment which should
contain the section.

If you place a section in one or more segments using @@samp{:@@var{phdr}},
then the linker will place all subsequent allocatable sections which do
not specify @@samp{:@@var{phdr}} in the same segments.  This is for
convenience, since generally a whole set of contiguous sections will be
placed in a single segment.  You can use @@code{:NONE} to override the
default segment and tell the linker to not put the section in any
segment at all.

@@kindex FILEHDR
@@kindex PHDRS
You may use the @@code{FILEHDR} and @@code{PHDRS} keywords appear after
the program header type to further describe the contents of the segment.
The @@code{FILEHDR} keyword means that the segment should include the ELF
file header.  The @@code{PHDRS} keyword means that the segment should
include the ELF program headers themselves.

The @@var{type} may be one of the following.  The numbers indicate the
value of the keyword.

@@table @@asis
@@item @@code{PT_NULL} (0)
Indicates an unused program header.

@@item @@code{PT_LOAD} (1)
Indicates that this program header describes a segment to be loaded from
the file.

@@item @@code{PT_DYNAMIC} (2)
Indicates a segment where dynamic linking information can be found.

@@item @@code{PT_INTERP} (3)
Indicates a segment where the name of the program interpreter may be
found.

@@item @@code{PT_NOTE} (4)
Indicates a segment holding note information.

@@item @@code{PT_SHLIB} (5)
A reserved program header type, defined but not specified by the ELF
ABI.

@@item @@code{PT_PHDR} (6)
Indicates a segment where the program headers may be found.

@@item @@var{expression}
An expression giving the numeric type of the program header.  This may
be used for types not defined above.
@@end table

You can specify that a segment should be loaded at a particular address
in memory by using an @@code{AT} expression.  This is identical to the
@@code{AT} command used as an output section attribute (@@pxref{Output
Section LMA}).  The @@code{AT} command for a program header overrides the
output section attribute.

The linker will normally set the segment flags based on the sections
which comprise the segment.  You may use the @@code{FLAGS} keyword to
explicitly specify the segment flags.  The value of @@var{flags} must be
an integer.  It is used to set the @@code{p_flags} field of the program
header.

Here is an example of @@code{PHDRS}.  This shows a typical set of program
headers used on a native ELF system.

@@kindex VERSION @@{script text@@}
@@cindex symbol versions
@@cindex version script
@@cindex versions of symbols
The linker supports symbol versions when using ELF.  Symbol versions are
only useful when using shared libraries.  The dynamic linker can use
symbol versions to select a specific version of a function when it runs
a program that may have been linked against an earlier version of the
shared library.

You can include a version script directly in the main linker script, or
you can supply the version script as an implicit linker script.  You can
also use the @@samp{--version-script} linker option.

The syntax of the @@code{VERSION} command is simply
@@smallexample
VERSION @@{ version-script-commands @@}
@@end smallexample

The format of the version script commands is identical to that used by
Sun's linker in Solaris 2.5.  The version script defines a tree of
version nodes.  You specify the node names and interdependencies in the
version script.  You can specify which symbols are bound to which
version nodes, and you can reduce a specified set of symbols to local
scope so that they are not globally visible outside of the shared
library.

The easiest way to demonstrate the version script language is with a few
examples.

@@smallexample
VERS_1.1 @@{
	 global:
		 foo1;
	 local:
		 old*;
		 original*;
		 new*;
@@};

VERS_1.2 @@{
		 foo2;
@@} VERS_1.1;

VERS_2.0 @@{
		 bar1; bar2;
@@} VERS_1.2;
@@end smallexample

This example version script defines three version nodes.  The first
version node defined is @@samp{VERS_1.1}; it has no other dependencies.
The script binds the symbol @@samp{foo1} to @@samp{VERS_1.1}.  It reduces
a number of symbols to local scope so that they are not visible outside
of the shared library; this is done using wildcard patterns, so that any
symbol whose name begins with @@samp{old}, @@samp{original}, or @@samp{new}
is matched.  The wildcard patterns available are the same as those used
in the shell when matching filenames (also known as ``globbing'').

Next, the version script defines node @@samp{VERS_1.2}.  This node
depends upon @@samp{VERS_1.1}.  The script binds the symbol @@samp{foo2}
to the version node @@samp{VERS_1.2}.

Finally, the version script defines node @@samp{VERS_2.0}.  This node
depends upon @@samp{VERS_1.2}.  The scripts binds the symbols @@samp{bar1}
and @@samp{bar2} are bound to the version node @@samp{VERS_2.0}.

When the linker finds a symbol defined in a library which is not
specifically bound to a version node, it will effectively bind it to an
unspecified base version of the library.  You can bind all otherwise
unspecified symbols to a given version node by using @@samp{global: *;}
somewhere in the version script.

The names of the version nodes have no specific meaning other than what
they might suggest to the person reading them.  The @@samp{2.0} version
could just as well have appeared in between @@samp{1.1} and @@samp{1.2}.
However, this would be a confusing way to write a version script.

Node name can be omited, provided it is the only version node
in the version script.  Such version script doesn't assign any versions to
symbols, only selects which symbols will be globally visible out and which
won't.

@@smallexample
@@{ global: foo; bar; local: *; @@};
@@end smallexample

When you link an application against a shared library that has versioned
symbols, the application itself knows which version of each symbol it
requires, and it also knows which version nodes it needs from each
shared library it is linked against.  Thus at runtime, the dynamic
loader can make a quick check to make sure that the libraries you have
linked against do in fact supply all of the version nodes that the
application will need to resolve all of the dynamic symbols.  In this
way it is possible for the dynamic linker to know with certainty that
all external symbols that it needs will be resolvable without having to
search for each symbol reference.

The symbol versioning is in effect a much more sophisticated way of
doing minor version checking that SunOS does.  The fundamental problem
that is being addressed here is that typically references to external
functions are bound on an as-needed basis, and are not all bound when
the application starts up.  If a shared library is out of date, a
required interface may be missing; when the application tries to use
that interface, it may suddenly and unexpectedly fail.  With symbol
versioning, the user will get a warning when they start their program if
the libraries being used with the application are too old.

There are several GNU extensions to Sun's versioning approach.  The
first of these is the ability to bind a symbol to a version node in the
source file where the symbol is defined instead of in the versioning
script.  This was done mainly to reduce the burden on the library
maintainer.  You can do this by putting something like:
@@smallexample
__asm__(".symver original_foo,foo@@@@VERS_1.1");
@@end smallexample
@@noindent
in the C source file.  This renames the function @@samp{original_foo} to
be an alias for @@samp{foo} bound to the version node @@samp{VERS_1.1}.
The @@samp{local:} directive can be used to prevent the symbol
@@samp{original_foo} from being exported. A @@samp{.symver} directive
takes precedence over a version script.

The second GNU extension is to allow multiple versions of the same
function to appear in a given shared library.  In this way you can make
an incompatible change to an interface without increasing the major
version number of the shared library, while still allowing applications
linked against the old interface to continue to function.

To do this, you must use multiple @@samp{.symver} directives in the
source file.  Here is an example:

@@smallexample
__asm__(".symver original_foo,foo@@@@");
__asm__(".symver old_foo,foo@@@@VERS_1.1");
__asm__(".symver old_foo1,foo@@@@VERS_1.2");
__asm__(".symver new_foo,foo@@@@@@@@VERS_2.0");
@@end smallexample

In this example, @@samp{foo@@@@} represents the symbol @@samp{foo} bound to the
unspecified base version of the symbol.  The source file that contains this
example would define 4 C functions: @@samp{original_foo}, @@samp{old_foo},
@@samp{old_foo1}, and @@samp{new_foo}.

When you have multiple definitions of a given symbol, there needs to be
some way to specify a default version to which external references to
this symbol will be bound.  You can do this with the
@@samp{foo@@@@@@@@VERS_2.0} type of @@samp{.symver} directive.  You can only
declare one version of a symbol as the default in this manner; otherwise
you would effectively have multiple definitions of the same symbol.

If you wish to bind a reference to a specific version of the symbol
within the shared library, you can use the aliases of convenience
(i.e., @@samp{old_foo}), or you can use the @@samp{.symver} directive to
specifically bind to an external version of the function in question.

You can also specify the language in the version script:

@@smallexample
VERSION extern "lang" @@{ version-script-commands @@}
@@end smallexample

The supported @@samp{lang}s are @@samp{C}, @@samp{C++}, and @@samp{Java}. 
The linker will iterate over the list of symbols at the link time and

@@cindex arithmetic
The syntax for expressions in the linker script language is identical to
that of C expressions.  All expressions are evaluated as integers.  All
expressions are evaluated in the same size, which is 32 bits if both the
host and target are 32 bits, and is otherwise 64 bits.

You can use and set symbol values in expressions.

The linker defines several special purpose builtin functions for use in
expressions.

Unless quoted, symbol names start with a letter, underscore, or period

Unquoted symbol names must not conflict with any keywords.  You can
specify a symbol which contains odd characters or has the same name as a
keyword by surrounding the symbol name in double quotes:
@@smallexample

Since symbols can contain many non-alphabetic characters, it is safest
to delimit symbols with spaces.  For example, @@samp{A-B} is one symbol,
whereas @@samp{A - B} is an expression involving subtraction.

@@subsection The Location Counter
@@kindex .
@@cindex dot
@@cindex location counter
@@cindex current output location
The special linker variable @@dfn{dot} @@samp{.} always contains the
current output location counter.  Since the @@code{.} always refers to a
location in an output section, it may only appear in an expression
within a @@code{SECTIONS} command.  The @@code{.} symbol may appear
anywhere that an ordinary symbol is allowed in an expression.

@@cindex holes
Assigning a value to @@code{.} will cause the location counter to be
moved.  This may be used to create holes in the output section.  The
location counter may never be moved backwards.

In the previous example, the @@samp{.text} section from @@file{file1} is
located at the beginning of the output section @@samp{output}.  It is
followed by a 1000 byte gap.  Then the @@samp{.text} section from
@@file{file2} appears, also with a 1000 byte gap following before the
@@samp{.text} section from @@file{file3}.  The notation @@samp{= 0x12345678}
specifies what data to write in the gaps (@@pxref{Output Section Fill}).

@@cindex dot inside sections
Note: @@code{.} actually refers to the byte offset from the start of the
current containing object.  Normally this is the @@code{SECTIONS}
statement, whose start address is 0, hence @@code{.} can be used as an
absolute address.  If @@code{.} is used inside a section description
however, it refers to the byte offset from the start of that section,
not an absolute address.  Thus in a script like this:

The @@samp{.text} section will be assigned a starting address of 0x100

the @@samp{.text} input sections to fill this area.  (If there is too

@@node Evaluation
@@subsection Evaluation
@@cindex lazy evaluation
@@cindex expression evaluation order
The linker evaluates expressions lazily.  It only computes the value of
an expression when absolutely necessary.

The linker needs some information, such as the value of the start
address of the first section, and the origins and lengths of memory
regions, in order to do any linking at all.  These values are computed
as soon as possible when the linker reads in the linker script.

However, other values (such as symbol values) are not known or needed
until after storage allocation.  Such values are evaluated later, when
other information (such as the sizes of output sections) is available
for use in the symbol assignment expression.

The sizes of sections cannot be known until after allocation, so
assignments dependent upon these are not performed until after
allocation.

Some expressions, such as those depending upon the location counter
@@samp{.}, must be evaluated during section allocation.

If the result of an expression is required, but the value is not
available, then an error results.  For example, a script like the
following

@@cindex symbols, relocatable and absolute
When the linker evaluates an expression, the result is either absolute
or relative to some section.  A relative expression is expressed as a
fixed offset from the base of a section.

The position of the expression within the linker script determines
whether it is absolute or relative.  An expression which appears within
an output section definition is relative to the base of the output
section.  An expression which appears elsewhere will be absolute.

A symbol set to a relative expression will be relocatable if you request
relocatable output using the @@samp{-r} option.  That means that a
further link operation may change the value of the symbol.  The symbol's
section will be the section of the relative expression.

A symbol set to an absolute expression will retain the same value
through any further link operation.  The symbol will be absolute, and
will not have any particular associated section.

You can use the builtin function @@code{ABSOLUTE} to force an expression
to be absolute when it would otherwise be relative.  For example, to
create an absolute symbol set to the address of the end of the output
section @@samp{.data}:
@@smallexample

@@cindex align expression
Return the location counter (@@code{.}) or arbitrary expression aligned
to the next @@var{align} boundary.  The single operand @@code{ALIGN}
doesn't change the value of the location counter---it just does
arithmetic on it.  The two operand @@code{ALIGN} allows an arbitrary
expression to be aligned upwards (@@code{ALIGN(@@var{align})} is
equivalent to @@code{ALIGN(., @@var{align})}).

Here is an example which aligns the output @@code{.data} section to the

memory will be saved at the expense of up to @@var{commonpagesize} wasted
bytes in the on-disk file.

This expression can only be used directly in @@code{SECTIONS} commands, not in
any output section descriptions and only once in the linker script.
@@var{commonpagesize} should be less or equal to @@var{maxpagesize} and should
be the system page size the object wants to be optimized for (while still
working on system page sizes up to @@var{maxpagesize}).

multiple sub-spaces.

@@cindex HPPA stub grouping
@@kindex --stub-group-size=@@var{N}
Long branch stubs and import/export stubs are placed by @@command{ld} in
stub sections located between groups of input sections.
@@samp{--stub-group-size} specifies the maximum size of a group of input
sections handled by one stub section.  Since branch offsets are signed,
a stub section may serve two groups of input sections, one group before
the stub section, and one group after it.  However, when using
conditional branches that require stubs, it may be better (for branch
prediction) that stub sections only serve one group of input sections.
A negative value for @@samp{N} chooses this scheme, ensuring that
branches to stubs always use a negative offset.  Two special values of
@@samp{N} are recognized, @@samp{1} and @@samp{-1}.  These both instruct
@@command{ld} to automatically size input section groups for the branch types
detected, with the same behaviour regarding stub placement as other
positive or negative values of @@samp{N} respectively.

Note that @@samp{--stub-group-size} does not split input sections.  A
single input section larger than the group size specified will of course
create a larger group (of one section).  If input sections are too
large, it may not be possible for a branch to reach its stub.

@@cindex import libraries 
@@item import libraries 
The standard Windows linker creates and uses so-called import
libraries, which contains information for linking to dll's.  They are
regular static archives and are handled as any other static
archive.  The cygwin and mingw ports of @@command{ld} have specific
support for creating such libraries provided with the
@@samp{--out-implib} command line option.

@@item   exporting DLL symbols 
@@cindex exporting DLL symbols 
The cygwin/mingw @@command{ld} has several ways to export symbols for dll's.

@@table @@emph
@@item   using auto-export functionality
@@cindex using auto-export functionality
By default @@command{ld} exports symbols with the auto-export functionality,
which is controlled by the following command line options:

@@itemize
@@item --export-all-symbols   [This is the default]
@@item --exclude-symbols
@@item --exclude-libs
@@end itemize

If, however, @@samp{--export-all-symbols} is not given explicitly on the 
command line, then the default auto-export behavior will be @@emph{disabled}
if either of the following are true:

@@itemize
@@item A DEF file is used.
@@item Any symbol in any object file was marked with the __declspec(dllexport) attribute.
@@end itemize

@@item   using a DEF file 
@@cindex using a DEF file 
Another way of exporting symbols is using a DEF file.  A DEF file is
an ASCII file containing definitions of symbols which should be
exported when a dll is created.  Usually it is named @@samp{<dll
name>.def} and is added as any other object file to the linker's
command line.  The file's name must end in @@samp{.def} or @@samp{.DEF}.

@@example
gcc -o <output> <objectfiles> <dll name>.def
@@end example

Using a DEF file turns off the normal auto-export behavior, unless the
@@samp{--export-all-symbols} option is also used.

Here is an example of a DEF file for a shared library called @@samp{xyz.dll}:

@@example
LIBRARY "xyz.dll" BASE=0x10000000

EXPORTS
foo
bar
_bar = bar
@@end example 

This example defines a base address and three symbols.  The third
symbol is an alias for the second.  For the complete format
specification see ld/deffilep.y in the binutils sources.

@@cindex creating a DEF file
While linking a shared dll, @@command{ld} is able to create a DEF file
with the @@samp{--output-def <file>} command line option.

@@item   Using decorations
@@cindex Using decorations
Another way of marking symbols for export is to modify the source code
itself, so that when building the DLL each symbol to be exported is
declared as:

@@example
__declspec(dllexport) int a_variable
__declspec(dllexport) void a_function(int with_args)
@@end example

All such symbols will be exported from the DLL.  If, however,
any of the object files in the DLL contain symbols decorated in
this way, then the normal auto-export behavior is disabled, unless
the @@samp{--export-all-symbols} option is also used.

Note that object files that wish to access these symbols must @@emph{not}
decorate them with dllexport.  Instead, they should use dllimport, 
instead:

@@example
__declspec(dllimport) int a_variable
__declspec(dllimport) void a_function(int with_args)
@@end example

This complicates the structure of library header files, because 
when included by the library itself the header must declare the 
variables and functions as dllexport, but when included by client
code the header must declare them as dllimport.  There are a number
of idioms that are typically used to do this; often client code can 
omit the __declspec() declaration completely.  See
@@samp{--enable-auto-import} and @@samp{automatic data imports} for more
imformation.
@@end table 

@@cindex automatic data imports
@@item automatic data imports
The standard Windows dll format supports data imports from dlls only
by adding special decorations (dllimport/dllexport), which let the
compiler produce specific assembler instructions to deal with this
issue.  This increases the effort necessary to port existing Un*x 
code to these platforms, especially for large
c++ libraries and applications.  The auto-import feature, which was
initially provided by Paul Sokolovsky, allows one to omit the 
decorations to archieve a behavior that conforms to that on POSIX/Un*x
platforms. This feature is enabled with the @@samp{--enable-auto-import} 
command-line option, although it is enabled by default on cygwin/mingw.
The @@samp{--enable-auto-import} option itself now serves mainly to
suppress any warnings that are ordinarily emitted when linked objects
trigger the feature's use.

auto-import of variables does not always work flawlessly without 
additional assistance.  Sometimes, you will see this message

"variable '<var>' can't be auto-imported. Please read the 
documentation for ld's @@code{--enable-auto-import} for details."

The @@samp{--enable-auto-import} documentation explains why this error 
occurs, and several methods that can be used to overcome this difficulty.  
One of these methods is the @@emph{runtime pseudo-relocs} feature, described 
below.

@@cindex runtime pseudo-relocation
For complex variables imported from DLLs (such as structs or classes), 
object files typically contain a base address for the variable and an 
offset (@@emph{addend}) within the variable--to specify a particular 
field or public member, for instance.  Unfortunately, the runtime loader used 
in win32 environments is incapable of fixing these references at runtime 
without the additional information supplied by dllimport/dllexport decorations.
The standard auto-import feature described above is unable to resolve these 
references.

The @@samp{--enable-runtime-pseudo-relocs} switch allows these references to 
be resolved without error, while leaving the task of adjusting the references 
themselves (with their non-zero addends) to specialized code provided by the 
runtime environment.  Recent versions of the cygwin and mingw environments and 
compilers provide this runtime support; older versions do not.  However, the 
support is only necessary on the developer's platform; the compiled result will 
run without error on an older system.

@@samp{--enable-runtime-pseudo-relocs} is not the default; it must be explicitly 
enabled as needed. 

@@cindex direct linking to a dll
@@item direct linking to a dll
The cygwin/mingw ports of @@command{ld} support the direct linking,
including data symbols, to a dll without the usage of any import
libraries.  This is much faster and uses much less memory than does the
traditional import library method, expecially when linking large
libraries or applications.  When @@command{ld} creates an import lib, each 
function or variable exported from the dll is stored in its own bfd, even 
though a single bfd could contain many exports.  The overhead involved in 
storing, loading, and processing so many bfd's is quite large, and explains the
tremendous time, memory, and storage needed to link against particularly 
large or complex libraries when using import libs.

Linking directly to a dll uses no extra command-line switches other than 
@@samp{-L} and @@samp{-l}, because @@command{ld} already searches for a number
of names to match each library.  All that is needed from the developer's 
perspective is an understanding of this search, in order to force ld to
select the dll instead of an import library.


For instance, when ld is called with the argument @@samp{-lxxx} it will attempt
to find, in the first directory of its search path,

@@example
libxxx.dll.a 
xxx.dll.a 
libxxx.a 
cygxxx.dll (*)
libxxx.dll 
xxx.dll 
@@end example

before moving on to the next directory in the search path.

(*) Actually, this is not @@samp{cygxxx.dll} but in fact is @@samp{<prefix>xxx.dll}, 
where @@samp{<prefix>} is set by the @@command{ld} option 
@@samp{--dll-search-prefix=<prefix>}. In the case of cygwin, the standard gcc spec 
file includes @@samp{--dll-search-prefix=cyg}, so in effect we actually search for 
@@samp{cygxxx.dll}.

Other win32-based unix environments, such as mingw or pw32, may use other 
@@samp{<prefix>}es, although at present only cygwin makes use of this feature.  It 
was originally intended to help avoid name conflicts among dll's built for the
various win32/un*x environments, so that (for example) two versions of a zlib dll
could coexist on the same machine.

The generic cygwin/mingw path layout uses a @@samp{bin} directory for
applications and dll's and a @@samp{lib} directory for the import
libraries (using cygwin nomenclature):

@@example
bin/
	cygxxx.dll
lib/
	libxxx.dll.a   (in case of dll's)
	libxxx.a       (in case of static archive) 
@@end example

Linking directly to a dll without using the import library can be 
done two ways: 

1. Use the dll directly by adding the @@samp{bin} path to the link line
@@example
gcc -Wl,-verbose  -o a.exe -L../bin/ -lxxx
@@end example 

However, as the dll's often have version numbers appended to their names
(@@samp{cygncurses-5.dll}) this will often fail, unless one specifies
@@samp{-L../bin -lncurses-5} to include the version.  Import libs are generally
not versioned, and do not have this difficulty.

2. Create a symbolic link from the dll to a file in the @@samp{lib}
directory according to the above mentioned search pattern.  This
should be used to avoid unwanted changes in the tools needed for
making the app/dll.

@@example
ln -s bin/cygxxx.dll lib/[cyg|lib|]xxx.dll[.a]
@@end example 

Then you can link without any make environment changes.

@@example
gcc -Wl,-verbose  -o a.exe -L../lib/ -lxxx
@@end example 

This technique also avoids the version number problems, because the following is
perfectly legal

@@example
bin/
	cygxxx-5.dll
lib/
	libxxx.dll.a -> ../bin/cygxxx-5.dll 
@@end example

Linking directly to a dll without using an import lib will work
even when auto-import features are exercised, and even when
@@samp{--enable-runtime-pseudo-relocs} is used.

Given the improvements in speed and memory usage, one might justifiably
wonder why import libraries are used at all.  There are two reasons:

1. Until recently, the link-directly-to-dll functionality did @@emph{not}
work with auto-imported data.

2. Sometimes it is necessary to include pure static objects within the
import library (which otherwise contains only bfd's for indirection
symbols that point to the exports of a dll).  Again, the import lib
for the cygwin kernel makes use of this ability, and it is not
possible to do this without an import lib.

So, import libs are not going away.  But the ability to replace
true import libs with a simple symbolic link to (or a copy of) 
a dll, in most cases, is a useful addition to the suite of tools 
binutils makes available to the win32 developer.  Given the 
massive improvements in memory requirements during linking, storage
requirements, and linking speed, we expect that many developers
will soon begin to use this feature whenever possible.

@@item symbol aliasing  
@@table @@emph
@@item adding additional names 
Sometimes, it is useful to export symbols with additional names.  
A symbol @@samp{foo} will be exported as @@samp{foo}, but it can also be
exported as @@samp{_foo} by using special directives in the DEF file
when creating the dll.  This will affect also the optional created
import library.  Consider the following DEF file: 

@@example 
LIBRARY "xyz.dll" BASE=0x61000000

EXPORTS
foo 
_foo = foo
@@end example 

The line @@samp{_foo = foo} maps the symbol @@samp{foo} to @@samp{_foo}.

Another method for creating a symbol alias is to create it in the
source code using the "weak" attribute:

@@example 
void foo () @@{ /* Do something.  */; @@} 
void _foo () __attribute__ ((weak, alias ("foo")));
@@end example 

See the gcc manual for more information about attributes and weak
symbols.

@@item renaming symbols
Sometimes it is useful to rename exports.  For instance, the cygwin
kernel does this regularly.  A symbol @@samp{_foo} can be exported as 
@@samp{foo} but not as @@samp{_foo} by using special directives in the
DEF file. (This will also affect the import library, if it is
created).  In the following example: 

@@example 
LIBRARY "xyz.dll" BASE=0x61000000

EXPORTS
_foo = foo
@@end example 

The line @@samp{_foo = foo} maps the exported symbol @@samp{foo} to
@@samp{_foo}.
@@end table 

Note: using a DEF file disables the default auto-export behavior,
unless the @@samp{--export-all-symbols} command line option is used. 
If, however, you are trying to rename symbols, then you should list
@@emph{all} desired exports in the DEF file, including the symbols 
that are not being renamed, and do @@emph{not} use the 
@@samp{--export-all-symbols} option.  If you list only the 
renamed symbols in the DEF file, and use @@samp{--export-all-symbols} 
to handle the other symbols, then the both the new names @@emph{and} 
the original names for the renamed symbols will be exported.  
In effect, you'd be aliasing those symbols, not renaming them, 
which is probably not what you wanted.

The default @@command{ld} behavior for Xtensa processors is to interpret

keep literal pools within the range of PC-relative load offsets.  For

@@command{ld} may interleave some of the @@code{.literal}

literal pools are within the range of PC-relative load offsets.  A valid
interleaving might place the @@code{.literal} sections from an initial
group of files followed by the @@code{.text} sections of that group of
files.  Then, the @@code{.literal} sections from the rest of the files
and the @@code{.text} sections from the rest of the files would follow.

@@option{--no-relax} option to disable this optimization.  When enabled,
the relaxation algorithm ensures that a literal will only be merged with
another literal when the new merged literal location is within the
offset range of all of its uses.

The relaxation mechanism will also attempt to optimize
assembler-generated ``longcall'' sequences of
@@code{L32R}/@@code{CALLX@@var{n}} when the target is known to fit into a
@@code{CALL@@var{n}} instruction encoding.  The current optimization
converts the sequence into @@code{NOP}/@@code{CALL@@var{n}} and removes the

A number of companies and individuals offer support for @@sc{gnu}
products.  If you obtained @@command{ld} from a support organization, we
recommend you contact that organization first.

You can find contact information for many support companies and
individuals in the file @@file{etc/SERVICE} in the @@sc{gnu} Emacs
distribution.

Otherwise, send bug reports for @@command{ld} to
@@samp{bug-binutils@@@@gnu.org}.

The fundamental principle of reporting bugs usefully is this:
@@strong{report all the facts}.  If you are not sure whether to state a
fact or leave it out, state it!

Often people omit facts because they think they know what causes the
problem and assume that some details do not matter.  Thus, you might
assume that the name of a symbol you use in an example does not
matter.  Well, probably it does not, but one cannot be sure.  Perhaps
the bug is a stray memory reference which happens to fetch from the
location where that name is stored in memory; perhaps, if the name
were different, the contents of that location would fool the linker
into doing the right thing despite the bug.  Play it safe and give a
specific, complete example.  That is the easiest thing for you to do,
and the most helpful. 

Keep in mind that the purpose of a bug report is to enable us to fix
the bug if it is new to us.  Therefore, always write your bug reports
on the assumption that the bug has not been reported previously.

Sometimes people give a few sketchy facts and ask, ``Does this ring a
bell?''  This cannot help us fix a bug, so it is basically useless.  We
respond by asking for enough details to enable us to investigate.
You might as well expedite matters by sending them to begin with.

To enable us to fix the bug, you should include all these things:

@@itemize @@bullet
@@item
The version of @@command{ld}.  @@command{ld} announces it if you start it with
the @@samp{--version} argument.

Without this, we will not know whether there is any point in looking for
the bug in the current version of @@command{ld}.

@@item
Any patches you may have applied to the @@command{ld} source, including any
patches made to the @@code{BFD} library.

@@item
The type of machine you are using, and the operating system name and
version number.

@@item
What compiler (and its version) was used to compile @@command{ld}---e.g.
``@@code{gcc-2.7}''.

@@item
The command arguments you gave the linker to link your example and
observe the bug.  To guarantee you will not omit something important,
list them all.  A copy of the Makefile (or the output from make) is
sufficient.

If we were to try to guess the arguments, we would probably guess wrong
and then we might not encounter the bug.

@@item
A complete input file, or set of input files, that will reproduce the
bug.  It is generally most helpful to send the actual object files
provided that they are reasonably small.  Say no more than 10K.  For
bigger files you can either make them available by FTP or HTTP or else
state that you are willing to send the object file(s) to whomever
requests them.  (Note - your email will be going to a mailing list, so
we do not want to clog it up with large attachments).  But small
attachments are best.

If the source files were assembled using @@code{gas} or compiled using
@@code{gcc}, then it may be OK to send the source files rather than the
object files.  In this case, be sure to say exactly what version of
@@code{gas} or @@code{gcc} was used to produce the object files.  Also say
how @@code{gas} or @@code{gcc} were configured.

@@item
A description of what behavior you observe that you believe is
incorrect.  For example, ``It gets a fatal signal.''

Of course, if the bug is that @@command{ld} gets a fatal signal, then we
will certainly notice it.  But if the bug is incorrect output, we might
not notice unless it is glaringly wrong.  You might as well not give us
a chance to make a mistake.

Even if the problem you experience is a fatal signal, you should still
say so explicitly.  Suppose something strange is going on, such as, your
copy of @@command{ld} is out of synch, or you have encountered a bug in the
C library on your system.  (This has happened!)  Your copy might crash
and ours would not.  If you told us to expect a crash, then when ours
fails to crash, we would know that the bug was not happening for us.  If
you had not told us to expect a crash, then we would not be able to draw
any conclusion from our observations.

@@item
If you wish to suggest changes to the @@command{ld} source, send us context
diffs, as generated by @@code{diff} with the @@samp{-u}, @@samp{-c}, or
@@samp{-p} option.  Always send diffs from the old file to the new file.
If you even discuss something in the @@command{ld} source, refer to it by
context, not by line number.

The line numbers in our development sources will not match those in your
sources.  Your line numbers would convey no useful information to us.

Here are some things that are not necessary:

@@itemize @@bullet
@@item
A description of the envelope of the bug.

Often people who encounter a bug spend a lot of time investigating
which changes to the input file will make the bug go away and which
changes will not affect it.

This is often time consuming and not very useful, because the way we
will find the bug is by running a single example under the debugger
with breakpoints, not by pure deduction from a series of examples.
We recommend that you save your time for something else.

Of course, if you can find a simpler example to report @@emph{instead}
of the original one, that is a convenience for us.  Errors in the
output will be easier to spot, running under the debugger will take
less time, and so on.

However, simplification is not vital; if you do not want to do this,
report the bug anyway and send us the entire test case you used.

@@item
A patch for the bug.

A patch for the bug does help us if it is a good one.  But do not omit
the necessary information, such as the test case, on the assumption that
a patch is all we need.  We might see problems with your patch and decide
to fix the problem another way, or we might not understand it at all.

Sometimes with a program as complicated as @@command{ld} it is very hard to
construct an example that will make the program follow a certain path
through the code.  If you do not send us the example, we will not be
able to construct one, so we will not be able to verify that the bug is
fixed.

And if we cannot understand what bug you are trying to fix, or why your
patch should be an improvement, we will not install it.  A test case will
help us to understand.

@@item
A guess about what the bug is or what it depends on.

Such guesses are usually wrong.  Even we cannot guess right about such
things without first using the debugger to find the facts.

@@appendix MRI Compatible Script Files
@@cindex MRI compatibility
To aid users making the transition to @@sc{gnu} @@command{ld} from the MRI
linker, @@command{ld} can use MRI compatible linker scripts as an
alternative to the more general-purpose linker scripting language
described in @@ref{Scripts}.  MRI compatible linker scripts have a much
simpler command set than the scripting language otherwise used with
@@command{ld}.  @@sc{gnu} @@command{ld} supports the most commonly used MRI
linker commands; these commands are described here.

In general, MRI scripts aren't of much use with the @@code{a.out} object
file format, since it only has three sections and MRI scripts lack some
features to make use of them.

You can specify a file containing an MRI-compatible script using the
@@samp{-c} command-line option.

Each command in an MRI-compatible script occupies its own line; each
command line starts with the keyword that identifies the command (though
blank lines are also allowed for punctuation).  If a line of an
MRI-compatible script begins with an unrecognized keyword, @@command{ld}
issues a warning message, but continues processing the script.

Lines beginning with @@samp{*} are comments.

You can write these commands using all upper-case letters, or all
lower case; for example, @@samp{chip} is the same as @@samp{CHIP}.
The following list shows only the upper-case form of each command.

@@table @@code
@@cindex @@code{ABSOLUTE} (MRI)
@@item ABSOLUTE @@var{secname}
@@itemx ABSOLUTE @@var{secname}, @@var{secname}, @@dots{} @@var{secname}
Normally, @@command{ld} includes in the output file all sections from all
the input files.  However, in an MRI-compatible script, you can use the
@@code{ABSOLUTE} command to restrict the sections that will be present in
your output program.  If the @@code{ABSOLUTE} command is used at all in a
script, then only the sections named explicitly in @@code{ABSOLUTE}
commands will appear in the linker output.  You can still use other
input sections (whatever you select on the command line, or using
@@code{LOAD}) to resolve addresses in the output file.

@@cindex @@code{ALIAS} (MRI)
@@item ALIAS @@var{out-secname}, @@var{in-secname}
Use this command to place the data from input section @@var{in-secname}
in a section called @@var{out-secname} in the linker output file.

@@var{in-secname} may be an integer.

@@cindex @@code{ALIGN} (MRI)
@@item ALIGN @@var{secname} = @@var{expression}
Align the section called @@var{secname} to @@var{expression}.  The
@@var{expression} should be a power of two.

@@cindex @@code{BASE} (MRI)
@@item BASE @@var{expression}
Use the value of @@var{expression} as the lowest address (other than
absolute addresses) in the output file.

@@cindex @@code{CHIP} (MRI)
@@item CHIP @@var{expression}
@@itemx CHIP @@var{expression}, @@var{expression}
This command does nothing; it is accepted only for compatibility.

@@cindex @@code{END} (MRI)
@@item END
This command does nothing whatever; it's only accepted for compatibility.

@@cindex @@code{FORMAT} (MRI)
@@item FORMAT @@var{output-format}
Similar to the @@code{OUTPUT_FORMAT} command in the more general linker
language, but restricted to one of these output formats:

@@enumerate
@@item
S-records, if @@var{output-format} is @@samp{S}

@@item
IEEE, if @@var{output-format} is @@samp{IEEE}

@@item
COFF (the @@samp{coff-m68k} variant in BFD), if @@var{output-format} is
@@samp{COFF}
@@end enumerate

@@cindex @@code{LIST} (MRI)
@@item LIST @@var{anything}@@dots{}
Print (to the standard output file) a link map, as produced by the
@@command{ld} command-line option @@samp{-M}.

The keyword @@code{LIST} may be followed by anything on the
same line, with no change in its effect.

@@cindex @@code{LOAD} (MRI)
@@item LOAD @@var{filename}
@@itemx LOAD @@var{filename}, @@var{filename}, @@dots{} @@var{filename}
Include one or more object file @@var{filename} in the link; this has the
same effect as specifying @@var{filename} directly on the @@command{ld}
command line.

@@cindex @@code{NAME} (MRI)
@@item NAME @@var{output-name}
@@var{output-name} is the name for the program produced by @@command{ld}; the
MRI-compatible command @@code{NAME} is equivalent to the command-line
option @@samp{-o} or the general script language command @@code{OUTPUT}.

@@cindex @@code{ORDER} (MRI)
@@item ORDER @@var{secname}, @@var{secname}, @@dots{} @@var{secname}
@@itemx ORDER @@var{secname} @@var{secname} @@var{secname}
Normally, @@command{ld} orders the sections in its output file in the
order in which they first appear in the input files.  In an MRI-compatible
script, you can override this ordering with the @@code{ORDER} command.  The
sections you list with @@code{ORDER} will appear first in your output
file, in the order specified.

@@cindex @@code{PUBLIC} (MRI)
@@item PUBLIC @@var{name}=@@var{expression}
@@itemx PUBLIC @@var{name},@@var{expression}
@@itemx PUBLIC @@var{name} @@var{expression}
Supply a value (@@var{expression}) for external symbol
@@var{name} used in the linker input files.

@@cindex @@code{SECT} (MRI)
@@item SECT @@var{secname}, @@var{expression}
@@itemx SECT @@var{secname}=@@var{expression}
@@itemx SECT @@var{secname} @@var{expression}
You can use any of these three forms of the @@code{SECT} command to
specify the start address (@@var{expression}) for section @@var{secname}.
If you have more than one @@code{SECT} statement for the same
@@var{secname}, only the @@emph{first} sets the start address.

 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.


0. PREAMBLE

The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
written document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone
the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without
modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.  Secondarily,
this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get
credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for
modifications made by others.

This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
license designed for free software.

We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.


1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a
notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed
under the terms of this License.  The "Document", below, refers to any
such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a licensee, and is
addressed as "you".

A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.

A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject
(or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly
within that overall subject.  (For example, if the Document is in part a
textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any
mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.

The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.

The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.

A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly and
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage
subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.  A copy that is
not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML
or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple
HTML designed for human modification.  Opaque formats include
PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that can be read and edited only
by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
processing tools are not generally available, and the
machine-generated HTML produced by some word processors for output
purposes only.

The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.


2. VERBATIM COPYING

You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.


3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than 100,
and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose
the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.

If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.

If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a publicly-accessible computer-network location containing a complete
Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material, which the
general network-using public has access to download anonymously at no
charge using public-standard network protocols.  If you use the latter
option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin
distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this
Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location
until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque
copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to
the public.

It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.


4. MODIFICATIONS

You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
   from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
   (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
   of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
   if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
   responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
   Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
   Document (all of its principal authors, if it has less than five).
C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
   Modified Version, as the publisher.
D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
   adjacent to the other copyright notices.
F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
   giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
   terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
   and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.
H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
I. Preserve the section entitled "History", and its title, and add to
   it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
   publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
   there is no section entitled "History" in the Document, create one
   stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
   given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
   Version as stated in the previous sentence.
J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
   public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
   the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
   it was based on.  These may be placed in the "History" section.
   You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
   least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
   publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
K. In any section entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
   preserve the section's title, and preserve in the section all the
   substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
   and/or dedications given therein.
L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
   unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
   or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
M. Delete any section entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
   may not be included in the Modified Version.
N. Do not retitle any existing section as "Endorsements"
   or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.

If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

You may add a section entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.

You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.


5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice.

The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled "History"
in the various original documents, forming one section entitled
"History"; likewise combine any sections entitled "Acknowledgements",
and any sections entitled "Dedications".  You must delete all sections
entitled "Endorsements."


6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.

You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.


7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a Modified Version
of the Document, provided no compilation copyright is claimed for the
compilation.  Such a compilation is called an "aggregate", and this
License does not apply to the other self-contained works thus compiled
with the Document, on account of their being thus compiled, if they
are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one quarter
of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that surround only the Document within the aggregate.
Otherwise they must appear on covers around the whole aggregate.


8. TRANSLATION

Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License provided that you also include the
original English version of this License.  In case of a disagreement
between the translation and the original English version of this
License, the original English version will prevail.


9. TERMINATION

You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except
as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other attempt to
copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However,
parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.


10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.

Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.


ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and
license notices just after the title page:

@@smallexample
    Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
    Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
    under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.1
    or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
    with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
    Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.
    A copy of the license is included in the section entitled "GNU
    Free Documentation License".
@@end smallexample

If you have no Invariant Sections, write "with no Invariant Sections"
instead of saying which ones are invariant.  If you have no
Front-Cover Texts, write "no Front-Cover Texts" instead of
"Front-Cover Texts being LIST"; likewise for Back-Cover Texts.

If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
to permit their use in free software.

``picture'' of the output file's layout, in varying degrees of detail.
No other command is required in all cases.

The @@code{MEMORY} command complements @@code{SECTIONS} by describing the

the start address, and the lengths of memory regions, in order to do any
linking at all; these values are computed as soon as possible when the
linker reads in the command file.  However, other values (such as symbol
values) are not known or needed until after storage allocation.  Such
values are evaluated later, when other information (such as the sizes of

@@cindex symbols, relocatable and absolute
When a linker expression is evaluated and assigned to a variable, it is
given either an absolute or a relocatable type. An absolute expression
type is one in which the symbol contains the value that it will have in
the output file; a relocatable expression type is one in which the
value is expressed as a fixed offset from the base of a section.

The type of the expression is controlled by its position in the script
file.  A symbol assigned within a section definition is created relative
to the base of the section; a symbol assigned in any other place is
created as an absolute symbol. Since a symbol created within a
section definition is relative to the base of the section, it
will remain relocatable if relocatable output is requested.  A symbol
may be created with an absolute value even when assigned to within a
section definition by using the absolute assignment function
@@code{ABSOLUTE}.  For example, to create an absolute symbol whose address
is the last byte of an output section named @@code{.data}:

The linker tries to put off the evaluation of an assignment until all
the terms in the source expression are known (@@pxref{Evaluation}).  For
instance, the sizes of sections cannot be known until after allocation,
so assignments dependent upon these are not performed until after
allocation. Some expressions, such as those depending upon the location
counter @@dfn{dot}, @@samp{.} must be evaluated during allocation. If the
result of an expression is required, but the value is not available,
then an error results.  For example, a script like the following

will cause the error message ``@@code{Non constant expression for initial

@@cindex provide
In some cases, it is desirable for a linker script to define a symbol
only if it is referenced, and only if it is not defined by any object
included in the link.  For example, traditional linkers defined the
symbol @@samp{etext}.  However, ANSI C requires that the user be able to
use @@samp{etext} as a function name without encountering an error.
The @@code{PROVIDE} keyword may be used to define a symbol, such as
@@samp{etext}, only if it is referenced but not defined.  The syntax is
@@code{PROVIDE(@@var{symbol} = @@var{expression})}.

(@@code{a.out}, for example, allows only @@code{.text}, @@code{.data} or

with numbers and not names (as is the case for Oasys), the name should be

@@cindex @@code{[@@var{section}@@dots{}]}, not supported
@@samp{[ @@var{section} @@dots{} ]} used to be accepted as an alternate way
to specify named sections from all unallocated input files.  Because
some operating systems (VMS) allow brackets in file names, that notation
is no longer supported.

Specify where in your output file to place uninitialized data
with this notation.  @@code{*(COMMON)} by itself refers to all
uninitialized data from all input files (so far as it is not yet
allocated); @@var{filename}@@code{(COMMON)} refers to uninitialized data
from a particular file.  Both are special cases of the general
mechanisms for specifying where to place input-file sections:
@@code{ld} permits you to refer to uninitialized data as if it
were in an input-file section named @@code{COMMON}, regardless of the
input file's format.

In any place where you may use a specific file or section name, you may
also use a wildcard pattern.  The linker handles wildcards much as the
Unix shell does.  A @@samp{*} character matches any number of characters.
A @@samp{?} character matches any single character.  The sequence
@@samp{[@@var{chars}]} will match a single instance of any of the
@@var{chars}; the @@samp{-} character may be used to specify a range of
characters, as in @@samp{[a-z]} to match any lower case letter.  A
@@samp{\} character may be used to quote the following character.

exception; it will always match any file name.  In a section name, the
wildcard characters will match a @@samp{/} character.

Wildcards only match files which are explicitly specified on the command
line.  The linker does not search directories to expand wildcards.
However, if you specify a simple file name---a name with no wildcard
characters---in a linker script, and the file name is not also specified
on the command line, the linker will attempt to open the file as though
it appeared on the command line.

In the following example, the command script arranges the output file
into three consecutive sections, named @@code{.text}, @@code{.data}, and
@@code{.bss}, taking the input for each from the correspondingly named
sections of all the input files:

and places them at the start of output section @@code{outputa} which
starts at location @@code{0x10000}. All of section @@code{.input1} from
file @@code{foo.o} follows immediately, in the same output section.  All

All of the remaining @@code{.input1} and @@code{.input2} sections from any

a3060 16

The ELF object file format uses @@dfn{program headers}, which are read by
the system loader and describe how the program should be loaded into
memory.  These program headers must be set correctly in order to run the
program on a native ELF system.  The linker will create reasonable
program headers by default.  However, in some cases, it is desirable to
specify the program headers more precisely; the @@code{PHDRS} command may
be used for this purpose.  When the @@code{PHDRS} command is used, the
linker will not generate any program headers itself.

The @@code{PHDRS} command is only meaningful when generating an ELF
output file.  It is ignored in other cases.  This manual does not
describe the details of how the system loader interprets program
headers; for more information, see the ELF ABI.  The program headers of
an ELF file may be displayed using the @@samp{-p} option of the
@@code{objdump} command.

of the linker script.  It does not get put into the output file.
d3467 8
a3474 19
Certain program header types describe segments of memory which are
loaded from the file by the system loader.  In the linker script, the
contents of these segments are specified by directing allocated output
sections to be placed in the segment.  To do this, the command
describing the output section in the @@code{SECTIONS} command should use
@@samp{:@@var{name}}, where @@var{name} is the name of the program header
as it appears in the @@code{PHDRS} command.  @@xref{Section Options}.

It is normal for certain sections to appear in more than one segment.
This merely implies that one segment of memory contains another.  This
is specified by repeating @@samp{:@@var{name}}, using it once for each
program header in which the section is to appear.

If a section is placed in one or more segments using @@samp{:@@var{name}},
then all subsequent allocated sections which do not specify
@@samp{:@@var{name}} are placed in the same segments.  This is for
convenience, since generally a whole set of contiguous sections will be
placed in a single segment.  To prevent a section from being assigned to
a segment when it would normally default to one, use @@code{:NONE}.
d3476 69
a3544 5
The @@code{FILEHDR} and @@code{PHDRS} keywords which may appear after the
program header type also indicate contents of the segment of memory.

include the ELF program headers themselves.

It is possible to specify that a segment should be loaded at a
particular address in memory.  This is done using an @@code{AT}
expression.  This is identical to the @@code{AT} command used in the
@@code{SECTIONS} command (@@pxref{Section Options}).  Using the @@code{AT}
command for a program header overrides any information in the
@@code{SECTIONS} command.

Normally the segment flags are set based on the sections.  The
@@code{FLAGS} keyword may be used to explicitly specify the segment
flags.  The value of @@var{flags} must be an integer.  It is used to

@@item CONSTRUCTORS
When linking using the @@code{a.out} object file format, the linker uses
an unusual set construct to support C++ global constructors and
destructors.  When linking object file formats which do not support
arbitrary sections, such as @@code{ECOFF} and @@code{XCOFF}, the linker
will automatically recognize C++ global constructors and destructors by
name.  For these object file formats, the @@code{CONSTRUCTORS} command
tells the linker where this information should be placed.  The
@@code{CONSTRUCTORS} command is ignored for other object file formats.

The symbol @@w{@@code{__CTOR_LIST__}} marks the start of the global
constructors, and the symbol @@w{@@code{__DTOR_LIST}} marks the end.  The
first word in the list is the number of entries, followed by the address
of each constructor or destructor, followed by a zero word.  The
compiler must arrange to actually run the code.  For these object file
formats @@sc{gnu} C++ calls constructors from a subroutine @@code{__main};
a call to @@code{__main} is automatically inserted into the startup code
for @@code{main}.  @@sc{gnu} C++ runs destructors either by using
@@code{atexit}, or directly from the function @@code{exit}.

For object file formats such as @@code{COFF} or @@code{ELF} which support
multiple sections, @@sc{gnu} C++ will normally arrange to put the
addresses of global constructors and destructors into the @@code{.ctors}
and @@code{.dtors} sections.  Placing the following sequence into your

runtime code expects to see.

Specify the full name for each @@var{file}, including @@samp{.a} if
required.

@@code{ld} searches for each @@var{file} through the archive-library

@@kindex OUTPUT ( @@var{filename} )
@@cindex naming the output file
@@item OUTPUT ( @@var{filename} )
Use this command to name the link output file @@var{filename}.  The
effect of @@code{OUTPUT(@@var{filename})} is identical to the effect of
@@w{@@samp{-o @@var{filename}}}, which overrides it.  You can use this
command to supply a default output-file name other than @@code{a.out}.

@@kindex OUTPUT_ARCH ( @@var{bfdname} )
@@cindex machine architecture, output
@@item OUTPUT_ARCH ( @@var{bfdname} )
Specify a particular output machine architecture, with one of the names
used by the BFD back-end routines (@@pxref{BFD}).  This command is often
unnecessary; the architecture is most often set implicitly by either the
system BFD configuration or as a side effect of the @@code{OUTPUT_FORMAT}
command.

@@kindex OUTPUT_FORMAT ( @@var{bfdname} )
@@cindex format, output file
@@item OUTPUT_FORMAT ( @@var{bfdname} )
When @@code{ld} is configured to support multiple object code formats,
you can use this command to specify a particular output format.
@@var{bfdname} is one of the names used by the BFD back-end routines
(@@pxref{BFD}).  The effect is identical to the effect of the
@@samp{--oformat} command-line option.  This selection affects only the
output file; the related command @@code{TARGET} affects primarily input

Add @@var{path} to the list of paths where @@code{ld} looks for

Ensure that @@var{filename} is the first input file used in the link

@@cindex input file format
@@kindex TARGET ( @@var{format} )
@@item TARGET ( @@var{format} )
When @@code{ld} is configured to support multiple object code formats,
you can use this command to change the input-file object code format
(like the command-line option @@samp{-b} or its synonym @@samp{--format}).
The argument @@var{format} is one of the strings used by BFD to name
binary formats.  If @@code{TARGET} is specified but @@code{OUTPUT_FORMAT}
is not, the last @@code{TARGET} argument is also used as the default
format for the @@code{ld} output file.  @@xref{BFD}.

@@kindex GNUTARGET
If you don't use the @@code{TARGET} command, @@code{ld} uses the value of
the environment variable @@code{GNUTARGET}, if available, to select the
output file format.  If that variable is also absent, @@code{ld} uses
the default format configured for your machine in the BFD libraries.
@@end ifclear

@@cindex cross references
@@kindex NOCROSSREFS ( @@var{sections} )
@@item NOCROSSREFS ( @@var{section} @@var{section} @@dots{} )
This command may be used to tell @@code{ld} to issue an error about any
references among certain sections.

In certain types of programs, particularly on embedded systems, when one
section is loaded into memory, another section will not be.  Any direct
references between the two sections would be errors.  For example, it
would be an error if code in one section called a function defined in
the other section.

The @@code{NOCROSSREFS} command takes a list of section names.  If
@@code{ld} detects any cross references between the sections, it reports
an error and returns a non-zero exit status.  The @@code{NOCROSSREFS}
command uses output section names, defined in the @@code{SECTIONS}
command.  It does not use the names of input sections.

This command ties up C++ style constructor and destructor records.  The
details of the constructor representation vary from one object format to
another, but usually lists of constructors and destructors appear as
special sections.  The @@code{CONSTRUCTORS} command specifies where the
linker is to place the data from these sections, relative to the rest of
the linked output.  Constructor data is marked by the symbol
@@w{@@code{__CTOR_LIST__}} at the start, and @@w{@@code{__CTOR_LIST_END}} at
the end; destructor data is bracketed similarly, between
@@w{@@code{__DTOR_LIST__}} and @@w{@@code{__DTOR_LIST_END}}.  (The compiler
must arrange to actually run this code; @@sc{gnu} C++ calls constructors from
a subroutine @@code{__main}, which it inserts automatically into the
startup code for @@code{main}, and destructors from @@code{_exit}.)

This is only meaningful for certain processors, such as the Alpha.
Specifically, some processors put large-valued constants in a special

of this section, so that constants can be loaded efficiently via a
base-register relative addressing mode.  Since the offset in
base-register relative mode is fixed and relatively small (e.g., 16
bits), this limits the maximum size of the constant pool.  Thus, in

values in order to be able to address all possible constants.  This

@@section ELF Program Headers
@@kindex PHDRS
@@kindex program headers
@@kindex ELF program headers

The ELF object file format uses @@dfn{program headers}, which are read by
the system loader and describe how the program should be loaded into
memory.  These program headers must be set correctly in order to run the
program on a native ELF system.  The linker will create reasonable
program headers by default.  However, in some cases, it is desirable to
specify the program headers more precisely; the @@code{PHDRS} command may
be used for this purpose.  When the @@code{PHDRS} command is used, the
linker will not generate any program headers itself.

The @@code{PHDRS} command is only meaningful when generating an ELF
output file.  It is ignored in other cases.  This manual does not
describe the details of how the system loader interprets program
headers; for more information, see the ELF ABI.  The program headers of
an ELF file may be displayed using the @@samp{-p} option of the
@@code{objdump} command.

This is the syntax of the @@code{PHDRS} command.  The words @@code{PHDRS},
@@code{FILEHDR}, @@code{AT}, and @@code{FLAGS} are keywords.

@@end group
@@end smallexample

The @@var{name} is used only for reference in the @@code{SECTIONS} command
of the linker script.  It does not get put into the output file.

Certain program header types describe segments of memory which are
loaded from the file by the system loader.  In the linker script, the
contents of these segments are specified by directing allocated output
sections to be placed in the segment.  To do this, the command
describing the output section in the @@code{SECTIONS} command should use
@@samp{:@@var{name}}, where @@var{name} is the name of the program header
as it appears in the @@code{PHDRS} command.  @@xref{Section Options}.

It is normal for certain sections to appear in more than one segment.
This merely implies that one segment of memory contains another.  This
is specified by repeating @@samp{:@@var{name}}, using it once for each
program header in which the section is to appear.

If a section is placed in one or more segments using @@samp{:@@var{name}},
then all subsequent allocated sections which do not specify
@@samp{:@@var{name}} are placed in the same segments.  This is for
convenience, since generally a whole set of contiguous sections will be
placed in a single segment.  To prevent a section from being assigned to
a segment when it would normally default to one, use @@code{:NONE}.

The @@code{FILEHDR} and @@code{PHDRS} keywords which may appear after the
program header type also indicate contents of the segment of memory.
The @@code{FILEHDR} keyword means that the segment should include the ELF
file header.  The @@code{PHDRS} keyword means that the segment should
include the ELF program headers themselves.

The @@var{type} may be one of the following.  The numbers indicate the
value of the keyword.

@@table @@asis
@@item @@code{PT_NULL} (0)
Indicates an unused program header.

@@item @@code{PT_LOAD} (1)
Indicates that this program header describes a segment to be loaded from
the file.

@@item @@code{PT_DYNAMIC} (2)
Indicates a segment where dynamic linking information can be found.

@@item @@code{PT_INTERP} (3)
Indicates a segment where the name of the program interpreter may be
found.

@@item @@code{PT_NOTE} (4)
Indicates a segment holding note information.

@@item @@code{PT_SHLIB} (5)
A reserved program header type, defined but not specified by the ELF
ABI.

@@item @@code{PT_PHDR} (6)
Indicates a segment where the program headers may be found.

@@item @@var{expression}
An expression giving the numeric type of the program header.  This may
be used for types not defined above.
@@end table

It is possible to specify that a segment should be loaded at a
particular address in memory.  This is done using an @@code{AT}
expression.  This is identical to the @@code{AT} command used in the
@@code{SECTIONS} command (@@pxref{Section Options}).  Using the @@code{AT}
command for a program header overrides any information in the
@@code{SECTIONS} command.

Normally the segment flags are set based on the sections.  The
@@code{FLAGS} keyword may be used to explicitly specify the segment
flags.  The value of @@var{flags} must be an integer.  It is used to
set the @@code{p_flags} field of the program header.

Here is an example of the use of @@code{PHDRS}.  This shows a typical set
of program headers used on a native ELF system.

When linking using the @@code{a.out} object file format, the linker uses
an unusual set construct to support C++ global constructors and
destructors.  When linking object file formats which do not support
arbitrary sections, such as @@code{ECOFF} and @@code{XCOFF}, the linker
will automatically recognize C++ global constructors and destructors by
name.  For these object file formats, the @@code{CONSTRUCTORS} command
tells the linker where this information should be placed.  The
@@code{CONSTRUCTORS} command is ignored for other object file formats.

The symbol @@w{@@code{__CTOR_LIST__}} marks the start of the global
constructors, and the symbol @@w{@@code{__DTOR_LIST}} marks the end.  The
first word in the list is the number of entries, followed by the address
of each constructor or destructor, followed by a zero word.  The
compiler must arrange to actually run the code.  For these object file
formats @@sc{gnu} C++ calls constructors from a subroutine @@code{__main};
a call to @@code{__main} is automatically inserted into the startup code
for @@code{main}.  @@sc{gnu} C++ runs destructors either by using
@@code{atexit}, or directly from the function @@code{exit}.

For object file formats such as @@code{COFF} or @@code{ELF} which support
multiple sections, @@sc{gnu} C++ will normally arrange to put the
addresses of global constructors and destructors into the @@code{.ctors}
and @@code{.dtors} sections.  Placing the following sequence into your
linker script will build the sort of table which the @@sc{gnu} C++
runtime code expects to see.

Normally the compiler and linker will handle these issues automatically,
and you will not need to concern yourself with them.  However, you may
need to consider this if you are using C++ and writing your own linker
scripts.

In any place where you may use a specific file or section name, you may
also use a wildcard pattern.  The linker handles wildcards much as the
Unix shell does.  A @@samp{*} character matches any number of characters.
A @@samp{?} character matches any single character.  The sequence
@@samp{[@@var{chars}]} will match a single instance of any of the
@@var{chars}; the @@samp{-} character may be used to specify a range of
characters, as in @@samp{[a-z]} to match any lower case letter.  A
@@samp{\} character may be used to quote the following character.

When a file name is matched with a wildcard, the wildcard characters
will not match a @@samp{/} character (used to separate directory names on
Unix).  A pattern consisting of a single @@samp{*} character is an
exception; it will always match any file name.  In a section name, the
wildcard characters will match a @@samp{/} character.

Wildcards only match files which are explicitly specified on the command
line.  The linker does not search directories to expand wildcards.
However, if you specify a simple file name---a name with no wildcard
characters---in a linker script, and the file name is not also specified
on the command line, the linker will attempt to open the file as though
it appeared on the command line.

In the following example, the command script arranges the output file
into three consecutive sections, named @@code{.text}, @@code{.data}, and

This example shows how wildcard patterns might be used to partition
files.  All @@code{.text} sections are placed in @@code{.text}, and all
@@code{.bss} sections are placed in @@code{.bss}.  For all files beginning

@@code{.DATA}; for all other files, the @@code{.data} section is placed
into @@code{.data}.

@@subsection Overlays
@@kindex OVERLAY
@@cindex overlays

The @@code{OVERLAY} command provides an easy way to describe sections
which are to be loaded as part of a single memory image but are to be
run at the same memory address.  At run time, some sort of overlay
manager will copy the overlaid sections in and out of the runtime memory
address as required, perhaps by simply manipulating addressing bits.
This approach can be useful, for example, when a certain region of
memory is faster than another.

The @@code{OVERLAY} command is used within a @@code{SECTIONS} command.  It
appears as follows:
@@smallexample
@@group
  OVERLAY @@var{start} : [ NOCROSSREFS ] AT ( @@var{ldaddr} )
   @@{
     @@var{secname1} @@{ @@var{contents} @@} :@@var{phdr} =@@var{fill}

     @@dots{}
   @@} >@@var{region} :@@var{phdr} =@@var{fill}
@@end group
@@end smallexample

Everything is optional except @@code{OVERLAY} (a keyword), and each
section must have a name (@@var{secname1} and @@var{secname2} above).  The
section definitions within the @@code{OVERLAY} construct are identical to
those within the general @@code{SECTIONS} contruct (@@pxref{SECTIONS}),
except that no addresses and no memory regions may be defined for
sections within an @@code{OVERLAY}.

The sections are all defined with the same starting address.  The load
addresses of the sections are arranged such that they are consecutive in
memory starting at the load address used for the @@code{OVERLAY} as a
whole (as with normal section definitions, the load address is optional,
and defaults to the start address; the start address is also optional,
and defaults to @@code{.}).

If the @@code{NOCROSSREFS} keyword is used, and there any references
among the sections, the linker will report an error.  Since the sections
all run at the same address, it normally does not make sense for one
section to refer directly to another.  @@xref{Option Commands,
NOCROSSREFS}.

For each section within the @@code{OVERLAY}, the linker automatically
defines two symbols.  The symbol @@code{__load_start_@@var{secname}} is
defined as the starting load address of the section.  The symbol
@@code{__load_stop_@@var{secname}} is defined as the final load address of
the section.  Any characters within @@var{secname} which are not legal
within C identifiers are removed.  C (or assembler) code may use these
symbols to move the overlaid sections around as necessary.

At the end of the overlay, the value of @@code{.} is set to the start
address of the overlay plus the size of the largest section.

Here is an example.  Remember that this would appear inside a
@@code{SECTIONS} construct.

@@smallexample
@@group

   @@{
     .text0 @@{ o1/*.o(.text) @@}

   @@}
@@end group
@@end smallexample

This will define both @@code{.text0} and @@code{.text1} to start at
address 0x1000.  @@code{.text0} will be loaded at address 0x4000, and
@@code{.text1} will be loaded immediately after @@code{.text0}.  The
following symbols will be defined: @@code{__load_start_text0},
@@code{__load_stop_text0}, @@code{__load_start_text1},
@@code{__load_stop_text1}.

C code to copy overlay @@code{.text1} into the overlay area might look
like the following.

@@smallexample
@@group
  extern char __load_start_text1, __load_stop_text1;

@@end group

Note that the @@code{OVERLAY} command is just syntactic sugar, since
everything it does can be done using the more basic commands.  The above
example could have been written identically as follows.

@@section How to report bugs
@@cindex bug reports
@@cindex @@code{ld} bugs, reporting

A number of companies and individuals offer support for @@sc{gnu}
products.  If you obtained @@code{ld} from a support organization, we
recommend you contact that organization first.

You can find contact information for many support companies and
individuals in the file @@file{etc/SERVICE} in the @@sc{gnu} Emacs
distribution.

In any event, we also recommend that you send bug reports for @@code{ld}
to @@samp{bug-gnu-utils@@@@prep.ai.mit.edu}.

The fundamental principle of reporting bugs usefully is this:
@@strong{report all the facts}.  If you are not sure whether to state a
fact or leave it out, state it!

Often people omit facts because they think they know what causes the
problem and assume that some details do not matter.  Thus, you might
assume that the name of a symbol you use in an example does not matter.
Well, probably it does not, but one cannot be sure.  Perhaps the bug is
a stray memory reference which happens to fetch from the location where
that name is stored in memory; perhaps, if the name were different, the
contents of that location would fool the linker into doing the right
thing despite the bug.  Play it safe and give a specific, complete
example.  That is the easiest thing for you to do, and the most helpful.

Keep in mind that the purpose of a bug report is to enable us to fix the bug if
it is new to us.  Therefore, always write your bug reports on the assumption
that the bug has not been reported previously.

Sometimes people give a few sketchy facts and ask, ``Does this ring a
bell?''  Those bug reports are useless, and we urge everyone to
@@emph{refuse to respond to them} except to chide the sender to report
bugs properly.

To enable us to fix the bug, you should include all these things:

@@itemize @@bullet
@@item
The version of @@code{ld}.  @@code{ld} announces it if you start it with
the @@samp{--version} argument.

Without this, we will not know whether there is any point in looking for
the bug in the current version of @@code{ld}.

@@item
Any patches you may have applied to the @@code{ld} source, including any
patches made to the @@code{BFD} library.

@@item
The type of machine you are using, and the operating system name and
version number.

@@item
What compiler (and its version) was used to compile @@code{ld}---e.g.
``@@code{gcc-2.7}''.

@@item
The command arguments you gave the linker to link your example and
observe the bug.  To guarantee you will not omit something important,
list them all.  A copy of the Makefile (or the output from make) is
sufficient.

If we were to try to guess the arguments, we would probably guess wrong
and then we might not encounter the bug.

@@item
A complete input file, or set of input files, that will reproduce the
bug.  It is generally most helpful to send the actual object files,
uuencoded if necessary to get them through the mail system.  Making them
available for anonymous FTP is not as good, but may be the only
reasonable choice for large object files.

If the source files were assembled using @@code{gas} or compiled using
@@code{gcc}, then it may be OK to send the source files rather than the
object files.  In this case, be sure to say exactly what version of
@@code{gas} or @@code{gcc} was used to produce the object files.  Also say
how @@code{gas} or @@code{gcc} were configured.

@@item
A description of what behavior you observe that you believe is
incorrect.  For example, ``It gets a fatal signal.''

Of course, if the bug is that @@code{ld} gets a fatal signal, then we
will certainly notice it.  But if the bug is incorrect output, we might
not notice unless it is glaringly wrong.  You might as well not give us
a chance to make a mistake.

Even if the problem you experience is a fatal signal, you should still
say so explicitly.  Suppose something strange is going on, such as, your
copy of @@code{ld} is out of synch, or you have encountered a bug in the
C library on your system.  (This has happened!)  Your copy might crash
and ours would not.  If you told us to expect a crash, then when ours
fails to crash, we would know that the bug was not happening for us.  If
you had not told us to expect a crash, then we would not be able to draw
any conclusion from our observations.

If you wish to suggest changes to the @@code{ld} source, send us context
diffs, as generated by @@code{diff} with the @@samp{-u}, @@samp{-c}, or
@@samp{-p} option.  Always send diffs from the old file to the new file.
If you even discuss something in the @@code{ld} source, refer to it by
context, not by line number.

The line numbers in our development sources will not match those in your
sources.  Your line numbers would convey no useful information to us.

@@itemize @@bullet
@@item
A description of the envelope of the bug.

Often people who encounter a bug spend a lot of time investigating
which changes to the input file will make the bug go away and which
changes will not affect it.

This is often time consuming and not very useful, because the way we
will find the bug is by running a single example under the debugger
with breakpoints, not by pure deduction from a series of examples.
We recommend that you save your time for something else.

Of course, if you can find a simpler example to report @@emph{instead}
of the original one, that is a convenience for us.  Errors in the
output will be easier to spot, running under the debugger will take
less time, and so on.

However, simplification is not vital; if you do not want to do this,
report the bug anyway and send us the entire test case you used.

@@item
A patch for the bug.

A patch for the bug does help us if it is a good one.  But do not omit
the necessary information, such as the test case, on the assumption that
a patch is all we need.  We might see problems with your patch and decide
to fix the problem another way, or we might not understand it at all.

Sometimes with a program as complicated as @@code{ld} it is very hard to
construct an example that will make the program follow a certain path
through the code.  If you do not send us the example, we will not be
able to construct one, so we will not be able to verify that the bug is
fixed.

And if we cannot understand what bug you are trying to fix, or why your
patch should be an improvement, we will not install it.  A test case will
help us to understand.

@@item
A guess about what the bug is or what it depends on.

Such guesses are usually wrong.  Even we cannot guess right about such
things without first using the debugger to find the facts.

The linker command script includes a command specifically for
specifying a version script, and is only meaningful for ELF platforms
that support shared libraries.  A version script can be
build directly into the linker script that you are using, or you
can supply the version script as just another input file to the linker
at the time that you link.  The command script syntax is:
@@smallexample
VERSION @@{ version script contents @@}
@@end smallexample
The version script can also be specified to the linker by means of the
@@samp{--version-script} linker command line option.
Version scripts are only meaningful when creating shared libraries.

The format of the version script itself is identical to that used by
Sun's linker in Solaris 2.5.  Versioning is done by defining a tree of
version nodes with the names and interdependencies specified in the
version script.  The version script can specify which symbols are bound
to which version nodes, and it can reduce a specified set of symbols to
local scope so that they are not globally visible outside of the shared
library.

The easiest way to demonstrate the version script language is with a few
examples.

@@smallexample
VERS_1.1 @@{
	 global:
		 foo1;
	 local:
		 old*; 
		 original*; 
		 new*; 
@@};

VERS_1.2 @@{
		 foo2;
@@} VERS_1.1;

VERS_2.0 @@{
		 bar1; bar2;
@@} VERS_1.2;
@@end smallexample

In this example, three version nodes are defined.  @@samp{VERS_1.1} is the
first version node defined, and has no other dependencies.  The symbol
@@samp{foo1} is bound to this version node, and a number of symbols
that have appeared within various object files are reduced in scope to
local so that they are not visible outside of the shared library.

Next, the node @@samp{VERS_1.2} is defined.  It depends upon
@@samp{VERS_1.1}.  The symbol @@samp{foo2} is bound to this version node.

Finally, the node @@samp{VERS_2.0} is defined.  It depends upon
@@samp{VERS_1.2}.  The symbols @@samp{bar1} and @@samp{bar2} are bound to
this version node.

Symbols defined in the library which aren't specifically bound to a
version node are effectively bound to an unspecified base version of the
library.  It is possible to bind all otherwise unspecified symbols to a
given version node using @@samp{global: *} somewhere in the version
script.

Lexically the names of the version nodes have no specific meaning other
than what they might suggest to the person reading them.  The @@samp{2.0}
version could just as well have appeared in between @@samp{1.1} and
@@samp{1.2}.  However, this would be a confusing way to write a version
script.

When you link an application against a shared library that has versioned
symbols, the application itself knows which version of each symbol it requires,
and it also knows which version nodes it needs from each shared library it is
linked against.  Thus at runtime, the dynamic loader can make a quick check to
make sure that the libraries you have linked against do in fact supply all
of the version nodes that the application will need to resolve all of the
dynamic symbols.  In this way it is possible for the dynamic linker to know
with certainty that all external symbols that it needs will be resolvable
without having to search for each symbol reference.

The symbol versioning is in effect a much more sophisticated way of
doing minor version checking that SunOS does.  The fundamental problem
that is being addressed here is that typically references to external
functions are bound on an as-needed basis, and are not all bound when
the application starts up.  If a shared library is out of date, a
required interface may be missing; when the application tries to use
that interface, it may suddenly and unexpectedly fail.  With symbol
versioning, the user will get a warning when they start their program if
the libraries being used with the application are too old.

There are several GNU extensions to Sun's versioning approach.  The
first of these is the ability to bind a symbol to a version node in the
source file where the symbol is defined instead of in the versioning
script.  This was done mainly to reduce the burden on the library
maintainer.  This can be done by putting something like:

@@smallexample
__asm__(".symver original_foo,foo@@@@VERS_1.1");
@@end smallexample

in the C source file.  This renamed the function @@samp{original_foo} to
be an alias for @@samp{foo} bound to the version node @@samp{VERS_1.1}.
The @@samp{local:} directive can be used to prevent the symbol
@@samp{original_foo} from being exported.

The second GNU extension is to allow multiple versions of the same function
to appear in a given shared library.  In this way an incompatible change to
an interface can take place without increasing the major version number of
the shared library, while still allowing applications linked against the old
interface to continue to function.

This can only be accomplished by using multiple @@samp{.symver}
directives in the assembler.  An example of this would be:

@@smallexample
__asm__(".symver original_foo,foo@@@@");
__asm__(".symver old_foo,foo@@@@VERS_1.1");
__asm__(".symver old_foo1,foo@@@@VERS_1.2");
__asm__(".symver new_foo,foo@@@@@@@@VERS_2.0");
@@end smallexample

In this example, @@samp{foo@@@@} represents the symbol @@samp{foo} bound to the
unspecified base version of the symbol.  The source file that contains this
example would define 4 C functions: @@samp{original_foo}, @@samp{old_foo},
@@samp{old_foo1}, and @@samp{new_foo}.

When you have multiple definitions of a given symbol, there needs to be
some way to specify a default version to which external references to
this symbol will be bound.  This can be accomplished with the
@@samp{foo@@@@@@@@VERS_2.0} type of @@samp{.symver} directive.  Only one version of
a symbol can be declared 'default' in this manner - otherwise you would
effectively have multiple definitions of the same symbol.

If you wish to bind a reference to a specific version of the symbol
within the shared library, you can use the aliases of convenience
(i.e. @@samp{old_foo}), or you can use the @@samp{.symver} directive to
specifically bind to an external version of the function in question.

The main purpose of the linker script is to describe how the sections in
the input files should be mapped into the output file, and to control
the memory layout of the output file.  Most linker scripts do nothing
more than this.  However, when necessary, the linker script can also
direct the linker to perform many other operations, using the commands
described below.

The linker always uses a linker script.  If you do not supply one
yourself, the linker will use a default script that is compiled into the
linker executable.  You can use the @@samp{--verbose} command line option
to display the default linker script.  Certain command line options,
such as @@samp{-r} or @@samp{-N}, will affect the default linker script.

You may supply your own linker script by using the @@samp{-T} command
line option.  When you do this, your linker script will replace the
default linker script.

You may also use linker scripts implicitly by naming them as input files
to the linker, as though they were files to be linked.  @@xref{Implicit
Linker Scripts}.

@@node Basic Script Concepts
@@section Basic Linker Script Concepts
@@cindex linker script concepts
We need to define some basic concepts and vocabulary in order to
describe the linker script language.

The linker combines input files into a single output file.  The output
file and each input file are in a special data format known as an
@@dfn{object file format}.  Each file is called an @@dfn{object file}.
The output file is often called an @@dfn{executable}, but for our
purposes we will also call it an object file.  Each object file has,
among other things, a list of @@dfn{sections}.  We sometimes refer to a
section in an input file as an @@dfn{input section}; similarly, a section
in the output file is an @@dfn{output section}.

Each section in an object file has a name and a size.  Most sections
also have an associated block of data, known as the @@dfn{section
contents}.  A section may be marked as @@dfn{loadable}, which mean that
the contents should be loaded into memory when the output file is run.
A section with no contents may be @@dfn{allocatable}, which means that an
area in memory should be set aside, but nothing in particular should be
loaded there (in some cases this memory must be zeroed out).  A section
which is neither loadable nor allocatable typically contains some sort
of debugging information.

Every loadable or allocatable output section has two addresses.  The
first is the @@dfn{VMA}, or virtual memory address.  This is the address
the section will have when the output file is run.  The second is the
@@dfn{LMA}, or load memory address.  This is the address at which the
section will be loaded.  In most cases the two addresses will be the
same.  An example of when they might be different is when a data section
is loaded into ROM, and then copied into RAM when the program starts up
(this technique is often used to initialize global variables in a ROM
based system).  In this case the ROM address would be the LMA, and the
RAM address would be the VMA.

You can see the sections in an object file by using the @@code{objdump}
program with the @@samp{-h} option.

Every object file also has a list of @@dfn{symbols}, known as the
@@dfn{symbol table}.  A symbol may be defined or undefined.  Each symbol
has a name, and each defined symbol has an address, among other
information.  If you compile a C or C++ program into an object file, you
will get a defined symbol for every defined function and global or
static variable.  Every undefined function or global variable which is
referenced in the input file will become an undefined symbol.

You can see the symbols in an object file by using the @@code{nm}
program, or by using the @@code{objdump} program with the @@samp{-t}
option.

@@node Script Format
@@section Linker Script Format
@@cindex linker script format
Linker scripts are text files.

You write a linker script as a series of commands.  Each command is
either a keyword, possibly followed by arguments, or an assignment to a
symbol.  You may separate commands using semicolons.  Whitespace is
generally ignored.

Strings such as file or format names can normally be entered directly.
If the file name contains a character such as a comma which would
otherwise serve to separate file names, you may put the file name in
double quotes.  There is no way to use a double quote character in a
file name.

You may include comments in linker scripts just as in C, delimited by
@@samp{/*} and @@samp{*/}.  As in C, comments are syntactically equivalent
to whitespace.

@@node Simple Example
@@section Simple Linker Script Example
@@cindex linker script example
@@cindex example of linker script
Many linker scripts are fairly simple.

The simplest possible linker script has just one command:
@@samp{SECTIONS}.  You use the @@samp{SECTIONS} command to describe the
memory layout of the output file.

The @@samp{SECTIONS} command is a powerful command.  Here we will
describe a simple use of it.  Let's assume your program consists only of
code, initialized data, and uninitialized data.  These will be in the
@@samp{.text}, @@samp{.data}, and @@samp{.bss} sections, respectively.
Let's assume further that these are the only sections which appear in
your input files.

For this example, let's say that the code should be loaded at address
0x10000, and that the data should start at address 0x8000000.  Here is a
linker script which will do that:
@@smallexample
SECTIONS
@@{
  . = 0x10000;
  .text : @@{ *(.text) @@}
  . = 0x8000000;
  .data : @@{ *(.data) @@}
  .bss : @@{ *(.bss) @@}
@@}
@@end smallexample
d1300 7
a1306 71
You write the @@samp{SECTIONS} command as the keyword @@samp{SECTIONS},
followed by a series of symbol assignments and output section
descriptions enclosed in curly braces.

The first line inside the @@samp{SECTIONS} command of the above example
sets the value of the special symbol @@samp{.}, which is the location
counter.  If you do not specify the address of an output section in some
other way (other ways are described later), the address is set from the
current value of the location counter.  The location counter is then
incremented by the size of the output section.  At the start of the
@@samp{SECTIONS} command, the location counter has the value @@samp{0}.

The second line defines an output section, @@samp{.text}.  The colon is
required syntax which may be ignored for now.  Within the curly braces
after the output section name, you list the names of the input sections
which should be placed into this output section.  The @@samp{*} is a
wildcard which matches any file name.  The expression @@samp{*(.text)}
means all @@samp{.text} input sections in all input files.

Since the location counter is @@samp{0x10000} when the output section
@@samp{.text} is defined, the linker will set the address of the
@@samp{.text} section in the output file to be @@samp{0x10000}.

The remaining lines define the @@samp{.data} and @@samp{.bss} sections in
the output file.  The linker will place the @@samp{.data} output section
at address @@samp{0x8000000}.  After the linker places the @@samp{.data}
output section, the value of the location counter will be
@@samp{0x8000000} plus the size of the @@samp{.data} output section.  The
effect is that the linker will place the @@samp{.bss} output section
immediately after the @@samp{.data} output section in memory

The linker will ensure that each output section has the required
alignment, by increasing the location counter if necessary.  In this
example, the specified addresses for the @@samp{.text} and @@samp{.data}
sections will probably satisfy any alignment constraints, but the linker
may have to create a small gap between the @@samp{.data} and @@samp{.bss}
sections.

That's it!  That's a simple and complete linker script.

@@node File Commands
@@subsection Commands dealing with files
@@cindex linker script file commands
Several linker script commands deal with files.

@@table @@code
@@item INCLUDE @@var{filename}
@@kindex INCLUDE @@var{filename}
@@cindex including a linker script
Include the linker script @@var{filename} at this point.  The file will
be searched for in the current directory, and in any directory specified
with the @@code{-L} option.  You can nest calls to @@code{INCLUDE} up to
10 levels deep.

@@item INPUT(@@var{file}, @@var{file}, @@dots{})
@@itemx INPUT(@@var{file} @@var{file} @@dots{})
@@kindex INPUT(@@var{files})
@@cindex input files in linker scripts
@@cindex input object files in linker scripts
@@cindex linker script input object files
The @@code{INPUT} command directs the linker to include the named files
in the link, as though they were named on the command line.

For example, if you always want to include @@file{subr.o} any time you do
a link, but you can't be bothered to put it on every link command line,
then you can put @@samp{INPUT (subr.o)} in your linker script.

In fact, if you like, you can list all of your input files in the linker
script, and then invoke the linker with nothing but a @@samp{-T} option.

The linker will first try to open the file in the current directory.  If
it is not found, the linker will search through the archive library
search path.  See the description of @@samp{-L} in @@ref{Options,,Command
Line Options}.

If you use @@samp{INPUT (-l@@var{file})}, @@code{ld} will transform the
name to @@code{lib@@var{file}.a}, as with the command line argument
@@samp{-l}.

When you use the @@code{INPUT} command in an implicit linker script, the
files will be included in the link at the point at which the linker
script file is included.  This can affect archive searching.

@@item GROUP(@@var{file}, @@var{file}, @@dots{})
@@itemx GROUP(@@var{file} @@var{file} @@dots{})
@@kindex GROUP(@@var{files})
@@cindex grouping input files
The @@code{GROUP} command is like @@code{INPUT}, except that the named
files should all be archives, and they are searched repeatedly until no
new undefined references are created.  See the description of @@samp{-(}
in @@ref{Options,,Command Line Options}.

@@item OUTPUT(@@var{filename})
@@kindex OUTPUT(@@var{filename})
@@cindex output file name in linker scripot
The @@code{OUTPUT} command names the output file.  Using
@@code{OUTPUT(@@var{filename})} in the linker script is exactly like using
@@samp{-o @@var{filename}} on the command line (@@pxref{Options,,Command
Line Options}).  If both are used, the command line option takes
precedence.

You can use the @@code{OUTPUT} command to define a default name for the
output file other than the usual default of @@file{a.out}.

@@item SEARCH_DIR(@@var{path})
@@kindex SEARCH_DIR(@@var{path})
@@cindex library search path in linker script
@@cindex archive search path in linker script
@@cindex search path in linker script
The @@code{SEARCH_DIR} command adds @@var{path} to the list of paths where
@@code{ld} looks for archive libraries.  Using
@@code{SEARCH_DIR(@@var{path})} is exactly like using @@samp{-L @@var{path}}
on the command line (@@pxref{Options,,Command Line Options}).  If both
are used, then the linker will search both paths.  Paths specified using
the command line option are searched first.

@@item STARTUP(@@var{filename})
@@kindex STARTUP(@@var{filename})
@@cindex first input file
The @@code{STARTUP} command is just like the @@code{INPUT} command, except
that @@var{filename} will become the first input file to be linked, as
though it were specified first on the command line.  This may be useful
when using a system in which the entry point is always the start of the
first file.
@@end table

@@ifclear SingleFormat
@@node Format Commands
@@subsection Commands dealing with object file formats
A couple of linker script commands deal with object file formats.

@@table @@code
@@item OUTPUT_FORMAT(@@var{bfdname})
@@itemx OUTPUT_FORMAT(@@var{default}, @@var{big}, @@var{little})
@@kindex OUTPUT_FORMAT(@@var{bfdname})
@@cindex output file format in linker script
The @@code{OUTPUT_FORMAT} command names the BFD format to use for the
output file (@@pxref{BFD}).  Using @@code{OUTPUT_FORMAT(@@var{bfdname})} is
exactly like using @@samp{-oformat @@var{bfdname}} on the command line
(@@pxref{Options,,Command Line Options}).  If both are used, the command
line option takes precedence.

You can use @@code{OUTPUT_FORMAT} with three arguments to use different
formats based on the @@samp{-EB} and @@samp{-EL} command line options.
This permits the linker script to set the output format based on the
desired endianness.

If neither @@samp{-EB} nor @@samp{-EL} are used, then the output format
will be the first argument, @@var{default}.  If @@samp{-EB} is used, the
output format will be the second argument, @@var{big}.  If @@samp{-EL} is
used, the output format will be the third argument, @@var{little}.

For example, the default linker script for the MIPS ELF target uses this
command:
@@smallexample
OUTPUT_FORMAT(elf32-bigmips, elf32-bigmips, elf32-littlemips)
@@end smallexample
This says that the default format for the output file is
@@samp{elf32-bigmips}, but if the user uses the @@samp{-EL} command line
option, the output file will be created in the @@samp{elf32-littlemips}
format.

@@item TARGET(@@var{bfdname})
@@kindex TARGET(@@var{bfdname})
@@cindex input file format in linker script
The @@code{TARGET} command names the BFD format to use when reading input
files.  It affects subsequent @@code{INPUT} and @@code{GROUP} commands.
This command is like using @@samp{-b @@var{bfdname}} on the command line
(@@pxref{Options,,Command Line Options}).  If the @@code{TARGET} command
is used but @@code{OUTPUT_FORMAT} is not, then the last @@code{TARGET}
command is also used to set the format for the output file.  @@xref{BFD}.

@@table @@code
@@item ASSERT(@@var{exp}, @@var{message})
@@kindex ASSERT
@@cindex assertion in linker script
Ensure that @@var{exp} is non-zero.  If it is zero, then exit the linker
with an error code, and print @@var{message}.

@@item EXTERN(@@var{symbol} @@var{symbol} @@dots{})
@@kindex EXTERN
@@cindex undefined symbol in linker script
Force @@var{symbol} to be entered in the output file as an undefined
symbol.  Doing this may, for example, trigger linking of additional
modules from standard libraries.  You may list several @@var{symbol}s for
each @@code{EXTERN}, and you may use @@code{EXTERN} multiple times.  This
command has the same effect as the @@samp{-u} command-line option.

@@item FORCE_COMMON_ALLOCATION
@@kindex FORCE_COMMON_ALLOCATION
@@cindex common allocation in linker script
This command has the same effect as the @@samp{-d} command-line option:
to make @@code{ld} assign space to common symbols even if a relocatable
output file is specified (@@samp{-r}).

@@item NOCROSSREFS(@@var{section} @@var{section} @@dots{})
@@kindex NOCROSSREFS(@@var{sections})
@@cindex cross references
This command may be used to tell @@code{ld} to issue an error about any
references among certain output sections.

In certain types of programs, particularly on embedded systems when
using overlays, when one section is loaded into memory, another section
will not be.  Any direct references between the two sections would be
errors.  For example, it would be an error if code in one section called
a function defined in the other section.

The @@code{NOCROSSREFS} command takes a list of output section names.  If
@@code{ld} detects any cross references between the sections, it reports
an error and returns a non-zero exit status.  Note that the
@@code{NOCROSSREFS} command uses output section names, not input section
names.

@@ifclear SingleFormat
@@item OUTPUT_ARCH(@@var{bfdarch})
@@kindex OUTPUT_ARCH(@@var{bfdarch})

In some cases, it is desirable for a linker script to define a symbol

@@samp{etext}.  However, ANSI C requires that the user be able to use
@@samp{etext} as a function name without encountering an error.  The
@@code{PROVIDE} keyword may be used to define a symbol, such as

If you do not use a @@code{SECTIONS} command in your linker script, the
linker will place each input section into an identically named output

@@cindex section name
The name of the output section is @@var{section}.  @@var{section} must
meet the constraints of your output format.  In formats which only
support a limited number of sections, such as @@code{a.out}, the name
must be one of the names supported by the format (@@code{a.out}, for
example, allows only @@samp{.text}, @@samp{.data} or @@samp{.bss}). If the
output format supports any number of sections, but with numbers and not
names (as is the case for Oasys), the name should be supplied as a
quoted numeric string.  A section name may consist of any sequence of
characters, but a name which contains any unusual characters such as
commas must be quoted.

The output section name @@samp{/DISCARD/} is special; @@ref{Output Section

@@cindex section address
The @@var{address} is an expression for the VMA (the virtual memory
address) of the output section.  If you do not provide @@var{address},
the linker will set it based on @@var{region} if present, or otherwise
based on the current value of the location counter.

If you provide @@var{address}, the address of the output section will be
set to precisely that.  If you provide neither @@var{address} nor
@@var{region}, then the address of the output section will be set to the
current value of the location counter aligned to the alignment
requirements of the output section.  The alignment requirement of the
output section is the strictest alignment of any input section contained
within the output section.

section.

The @@var{address} may be an arbitrary expression; @@ref{Expressions}.
For example, if you want to align the section on a 0x10 byte boundary,
so that the lowest four bits of the section address are zero, you could
do something like this:

The most common output section command is an input section description.

The input section description is the most basic linker script operation.

in memory.  You use input section descriptions to tell the linker how to
map the input files into your memory layout.

@@node Input Section Basics
@@subsubsection Input section basics
@@cindex input section basics
An input section description consists of a file name optionally followed
by a list of section names in parentheses.

The file name and the section name may be wildcard patterns, which we
describe further below (@@pxref{Input Section Wildcards}).

The most common input section description is to include all input
sections with a particular name in the output section.  For example, to
include all input @@samp{.text} sections, you would write:
d1938 5
a1942 1
*(.text)
d1944 1
d1946 24
a1969 4
Here the @@samp{*} is a wildcard which matches any file name.  To exclude a list
of files from matching the file name wildcard, EXCLUDE_FILE may be used to
match all files except the ones specified in the EXCLUDE_FILE list.  For
example:
d1971 1
a1971 1
(*(EXCLUDE_FILE (*crtend.o *otherfile.o) .ctors))
d1973 28
a2000 2
will cause all .ctors sections from all files except @@file{crtend.o} and
@@file{otherfile.o} to be included.
d2002 1
a2002 1
There are two ways to include more than one section:
d2004 1
a2004 2
*(.text .rdata)
*(.text) *(.rdata)
d2007 44
a2050 36
The difference between these is the order in which the @@samp{.text} and
@@samp{.rdata} input sections will appear in the output section.  In the
first example, they will be intermingled.  In the second example, all
@@samp{.text} input sections will appear first, followed by all
@@samp{.rdata} input sections.

You can specify a file name to include sections from a particular file.
You would do this if one or more of your files contain special data that
needs to be at a particular location in memory.  For example:
@@smallexample
data.o(.data)
@@end smallexample

If you use a file name without a list of sections, then all sections in
the input file will be included in the output section.  This is not
commonly done, but it may by useful on occasion.  For example:
@@smallexample
data.o
@@end smallexample

When you use a file name which does not contain any wild card
characters, the linker will first see if you also specified the file
name on the linker command line or in an @@code{INPUT} command.  If you
did not, the linker will attempt to open the file as an input file, as
though it appeared on the command line.  Note that this differs from an
@@code{INPUT} command, because the linker will not search for the file in
the archive search path.

@@node Input Section Wildcards
@@subsubsection Input section wildcard patterns
@@cindex input section wildcards
@@cindex wildcard file name patterns
@@cindex file name wildcard patterns
@@cindex section name wildcard patterns
In an input section description, either the file name or the section
name or both may be wildcard patterns.
d2052 21
a2072 2
The file name of @@samp{*} seen in many examples is a simple wildcard
pattern for the file name.
d2074 8
a2081 14
The wildcard patterns are like those used by the Unix shell.

@@table @@samp
@@item *
matches any number of characters
@@item ?
matches any single character
@@item [@@var{chars}]
matches a single instance of any of the @@var{chars}; the @@samp{-}
character may be used to specify a range of characters, as in
@@samp{[a-z]} to match any lower case letter
@@item \
quotes the following character
@@end table
d2086 14
a2099 29
exception; it will always match any file name, whether it contains a
@@samp{/} or not.  In a section name, the wildcard characters will match
a @@samp{/} character.

File name wildcard patterns only match files which are explicitly
specified on the command line or in an @@code{INPUT} command.  The linker
does not search directories to expand wildcards.

If a file name matches more than one wildcard pattern, or if a file name
appears explicitly and is also matched by a wildcard pattern, the linker
will use the first match in the linker script.  For example, this
sequence of input section descriptions is probably in error, because the
@@file{data.o} rule will not be used:
@@smallexample
.data : @@{ *(.data) @@}
.data1 : @@{ data.o(.data) @@}
@@end smallexample

@@cindex SORT
Normally, the linker will place files and sections matched by wildcards
in the order in which they are seen during the link.  You can change
this by using the @@code{SORT} keyword, which appears before a wildcard
pattern in parentheses (e.g., @@code{SORT(.text*)}).  When the
@@code{SORT} keyword is used, the linker will sort the files or sections
into ascending order by name before placing them in the output file.

If you ever get confused about where input sections are going, use the
@@samp{-M} linker option to generate a map file.  The map file shows
precisely how input sections are mapped to output sections.
a2100 6
This example shows how wildcard patterns might be used to partition
files.  This linker script directs the linker to place all @@samp{.text}
sections in @@samp{.text} and all @@samp{.bss} sections in @@samp{.bss}.
The linker will place the @@samp{.data} section from all files beginning
with an upper case character in @@samp{.DATA}; for all other files, the
linker will place the @@samp{.data} section in @@samp{.data}.

@@node Input Section Common
@@subsubsection Input section for common symbols
@@cindex common symbol placement
@@cindex uninitialized data placement
A special notation is needed for common symbols, because in many object
file formats common symbols do not have a particular input section.  The
linker treats common symbols as though they are in an input section
named @@samp{COMMON}.

You may use file names with the @@samp{COMMON} section just as with any
other input sections.  You can use this to place common symbols from a
particular input file in one section while common symbols from other
input files are placed in another section.

In most cases, common symbols in input files will be placed in the
@@samp{.bss} section in the output file.  For example:
@@smallexample
.bss @@{ *(.bss) *(COMMON) @@}
@@end smallexample

@@cindex scommon section
@@cindex small common symbols
Some object file formats have more than one type of common symbol.  For
example, the MIPS ELF object file format distinguishes standard common
symbols and small common symbols.  In this case, the linker will use a
different special section name for other types of common symbols.  In
the case of MIPS ELF, the linker uses @@samp{COMMON} for standard common
symbols and @@samp{.scommon} for small common symbols.  This permits you
to map the different types of common symbols into memory at different
locations.

@@cindex [COMMON]
You will sometimes see @@samp{[COMMON]} in old linker scripts.  This
notation is now considered obsolete.  It is equivalent to
@@samp{*(COMMON)}.

@@node Input Section Keep
@@subsubsection Input section and garbage collection
@@cindex KEEP
@@cindex garbage collection
When link-time garbage collection is in use (@@samp{--gc-sections}),
it is often useful to mark sections that should not be eliminated. 
This is accomplished by surrounding an input section's wildcard entry
with @@code{KEEP()}, as in @@code{KEEP(*(.init))} or
@@code{KEEP(SORT(*)(.ctors))}.

@@node Input Section Example
@@subsubsection Input section example
The following example is a complete linker script.  It tells the linker
to read all of the sections from file @@file{all.o} and place them at the
start of output section @@samp{outputa} which starts at location
@@samp{0x10000}.  All of section @@samp{.input1} from file @@file{foo.o}
follows immediately, in the same output section.  All of section
@@samp{.input2} from @@file{foo.o} goes into output section
@@samp{outputb}, followed by section @@samp{.input1} from @@file{foo1.o}.
All of the remaining @@samp{.input1} and @@samp{.input2} sections from any
files are written to output section @@samp{outputc}.

@@kindex BYTE(@@var{expression})
@@kindex SHORT(@@var{expression})
@@kindex LONG(@@var{expression})
@@kindex QUAD(@@var{expression})
@@kindex SQUAD(@@var{expression})
You can include explicit bytes of data in an output section by using
@@code{BYTE}, @@code{SHORT}, @@code{LONG}, @@code{QUAD}, or @@code{SQUAD} as
an output section command.  Each keyword is followed by an expression in
parentheses providing the value to store (@@pxref{Expressions}).  The
value of the expression is stored at the current value of the location
counter.

The @@code{BYTE}, @@code{SHORT}, @@code{LONG}, and @@code{QUAD} commands
store one, two, four, and eight bytes (respectively).  After storing the
bytes, the location counter is incremented by the number of bytes
stored.

For example, this will store the byte 1 followed by the four byte value
of the symbol @@samp{addr}:
@@smallexample
BYTE(1)
LONG(addr)
@@end smallexample

When using a 64 bit host or target, @@code{QUAD} and @@code{SQUAD} are the
same; they both store an 8 byte, or 64 bit, value.  When both host and
target are 32 bits, an expression is computed as 32 bits.  In this case
@@code{QUAD} stores a 32 bit value zero extended to 64 bits, and
@@code{SQUAD} stores a 32 bit value sign extended to 64 bits.

If the object file format of the output file has an explicit endianness,
which is the normal case, the value will be stored in that endianness.
When the object file format does not have an explicit endianness, as is
true of, for example, S-records, the value will be stored in the
endianness of the first input object file.

@@kindex FILL(@@var{expression})
@@cindex holes, filling
@@cindex unspecified memory
You may use the @@code{FILL} command to set the fill pattern for the
current section.  It is followed by an expression in parentheses.  Any
otherwise unspecified regions of memory within the section (for example,
gaps left due to the required alignment of input sections) are filled
with the two least significant bytes of the expression, repeated as
necessary.  A @@code{FILL} statement covers memory locations after the
point at which it occurs in the section definition; by including more
than one @@code{FILL} statement, you can have different fill patterns in
different parts of an output section.

This example shows how to fill unspecified regions of memory with the
value @@samp{0x9090}:
@@smallexample
FILL(0x9090)
@@end smallexample

The @@code{FILL} command is similar to the @@samp{=@@var{fillexp}} output
section attribute (@@pxref{Output Section Fill}), but it only affects the
part of the section following the @@code{FILL} command, rather than the
entire section.  If both are used, the @@code{FILL} command takes
precedence.

@@cindex constructors, arranging in link
@@item CONSTRUCTORS
When linking using the a.out object file format, the linker uses an
unusual set construct to support C++ global constructors and
destructors.  When linking object file formats which do not support
arbitrary sections, such as ECOFF and XCOFF, the linker will
automatically recognize C++ global constructors and destructors by name.
For these object file formats, the @@code{CONSTRUCTORS} command tells the
linker to place constructor information in the output section where the
@@code{CONSTRUCTORS} command appears.  The @@code{CONSTRUCTORS} command is
ignored for other object file formats.
d2210 25
a2234 10
The symbol @@w{@@code{__CTOR_LIST__}} marks the start of the global
constructors, and the symbol @@w{@@code{__DTOR_LIST}} marks the end.  The
first word in the list is the number of entries, followed by the address
of each constructor or destructor, followed by a zero word.  The
compiler must arrange to actually run the code.  For these object file
formats @@sc{gnu} C++ normally calls constructors from a subroutine
@@code{__main}; a call to @@code{__main} is automatically inserted into
the startup code for @@code{main}.  @@sc{gnu} C++ normally runs
destructors either by using @@code{atexit}, or directly from the function
@@code{exit}.
d2236 12
a2247 6
For object file formats such as @@code{COFF} or @@code{ELF} which support
arbitrary section names, @@sc{gnu} C++ will normally arrange to put the
addresses of global constructors and destructors into the @@code{.ctors}
and @@code{.dtors} sections.  Placing the following sequence into your
linker script will build the sort of table which the @@sc{gnu} C++
runtime code expects to see.
d2250 9
a2258 10
      __CTOR_LIST__ = .;

      __DTOR_END__ = .;
d2261 4
a2264 8
If you are using the @@sc{gnu} C++ support for initialization priority,
which provides some control over the order in which global constructors
are run, you must sort the constructors at link time to ensure that they
are executed in the correct order.  When using the @@code{CONSTRUCTORS}
command, use @@samp{SORT(CONSTRUCTORS)} instead.  When using the
@@code{.ctors} and @@code{.dtors} sections, use @@samp{*(SORT(.ctors))} and
@@samp{*(SORT(.dtors))} instead of just @@samp{*(.ctors)} and
@@samp{*(.dtors)}.

The linker will normally set the LMA equal to the VMA.  You can change
that by using the @@code{AT} keyword.  The expression @@var{lma} that
follows the @@code{AT} keyword specifies the load address of the

you may specify a memory region for the section's load address. @@xref{MEMORY}.

even though its VMA is @@code{0x2000}, and one called @@samp{.bss} to hold

An overlay description provides an easy way to describe sections which
are to be loaded as part of a single memory image but are to be run at
the same memory address.  At run time, some sort of overlay manager will
copy the overlaid sections in and out of the runtime memory address as
required, perhaps by simply manipulating addressing bits.  This approach
can be useful, for example, when a certain region of memory is faster
than another.

Overlays are described using the @@code{OVERLAY} command.  The

@@section MEMORY command
@@kindex MEMORY
@@cindex memory regions
@@cindex regions of memory
@@cindex allocating memory
@@cindex discontinuous memory
The linker's default configuration permits allocation of all available
memory.  You can override this by using the @@code{MEMORY} command.

The @@code{MEMORY} command describes the location and size of blocks of
memory in the target.  You can use it to describe which memory regions
may be used by the linker, and which memory regions it must avoid.  You
can then assign sections to particular memory regions.  The linker will
set section addresses based on the memory regions, and will warn about
regions that become too full.  The linker will not shuffle sections
around to fit into the available regions.

A linker script may contain at most one use of the @@code{MEMORY}
command.  However, you can define as many blocks of memory within it as
you wish.  The syntax is:
@@smallexample
@@group
MEMORY 
  @@{
    @@var{name} [(@@var{attr})] : ORIGIN = @@var{origin}, LENGTH = @@var{len}
    @@dots{}
  @@}
@@end group
@@end smallexample

The @@var{name} is a name used in the linker script to refer to the
region.  The region name has no meaning outside of the linker script.
Region names are stored in a separate name space, and will not conflict
with symbol names, file names, or section names.  Each memory region
must have a distinct name.

@@cindex memory region attributes
The @@var{attr} string is an optional list of attributes that specify
whether to use a particular memory region for an input section which is
not explicitly mapped in the linker script.  As described in
@@ref{SECTIONS}, if you do not specify an output section for some input
section, the linker will create an output section with the same name as
the input section.  If you define region attributes, the linker will use
them to select the memory region for the output section that it creates.

The @@var{attr} string must consist only of the following characters:
@@table @@samp
@@item R
Read-only section
@@item W
Read/write section
@@item X
Executable section
@@item A
Allocatable section
@@item I
Initialized section
@@item L
Same as @@samp{I}
@@item !
Invert the sense of any of the preceding attributes
@@end table

If a unmapped section matches any of the listed attributes other than
@@samp{!}, it will be placed in the memory region.  The @@samp{!}
attribute reverses this test, so that an unmapped section will be placed
in the memory region only if it does not match any of the listed
attributes.

@@kindex ORIGIN =
@@kindex o =
@@kindex org =
The @@var{origin} is an expression for the start address of the memory
region.  The expression must evaluate to a constant before memory
allocation is performed, which means that you may not use any section
relative symbols.  The keyword @@code{ORIGIN} may be abbreviated to
@@code{org} or @@code{o} (but not, for example, @@code{ORG}).

@@kindex LENGTH =
@@kindex len =
@@kindex l =
The @@var{len} is an expression for the size in bytes of the memory
region.  As with the @@var{origin} expression, the expression must
evaluate to a constant before memory allocation is performed.  The
keyword @@code{LENGTH} may be abbreviated to @@code{len} or @@code{l}.

In the following example, we specify that there are two memory regions
available for allocation: one starting at @@samp{0} for 256 kilobytes,
and the other starting at @@samp{0x40000000} for four megabytes.  The
linker will place into the @@samp{rom} memory region every section which
is not explicitly mapped into a memory region, and is either read-only
or executable.  The linker will place other sections which are not
explicitly mapped into a memory region into the @@samp{ram} memory
region.

Once you define a memory region, you can direct the linker to place
specific output sections into that memory region by using the
@@samp{>@@var{region}} output section attribute.  For example, if you have
a memory region named @@samp{mem}, you would use @@samp{>mem} in the
output section definition.  @@xref{Output Section Region}.  If no address
was specified for the output section, the linker will set the address to
the next available address within the memory region.  If the combined
output sections directed to a memory region are too large for the
region, the linker will issue an error message.

@@cindex program segments
@@cindex segments, ELF
The ELF object file format uses @@dfn{program headers}, also knows as
@@dfn{segments}.  The program headers describe how the program should be
loaded into memory.  You can print them out by using the @@code{objdump}
program with the @@samp{-p} option.

When you run an ELF program on a native ELF system, the system loader
reads the program headers in order to figure out how to load the
program.  This will only work if the program headers are set correctly.
This manual does not describe the details of how the system loader
interprets program headers; for more information, see the ELF ABI.

The linker will create reasonable program headers by default.  However,
in some cases, you may need to specify the program headers more
precisely.  You may use the @@code{PHDRS} command for this purpose.  When
the linker sees the @@code{PHDRS} command in the linker script, it will
not create any program headers other than the ones specified.

The linker only pays attention to the @@code{PHDRS} command when
generating an ELF output file.  In other cases, the linker will simply
ignore @@code{PHDRS}.

of the linker script.  It is not put into the output file.  Program
header names are stored in a separate name space, and will not conflict
with symbol names, file names, or section names.  Each program header
must have a distinct name.

Certain program header types describe segments of memory which the
system loader will load from the file.  In the linker script, you
specify the contents of these segments by placing allocatable output
sections in the segments.  You use the @@samp{:@@var{phdr}} output section
attribute to place a section in a particular segment.  @@xref{Output
Section Phdr}.

It is normal to put certain sections in more than one segment.  This
merely implies that one segment of memory contains another.  You may
repeat @@samp{:@@var{phdr}}, using it once for each segment which should
contain the section.

If you place a section in one or more segments using @@samp{:@@var{phdr}},
then the linker will place all subsequent allocatable sections which do
not specify @@samp{:@@var{phdr}} in the same segments.  This is for

You can specify that a segment should be loaded at a particular address
in memory by using an @@code{AT} expression.  This is identical to the
@@code{AT} command used as an output section attribute (@@pxref{Output
Section LMA}).  The @@code{AT} command for a program header overrides the
output section attribute.

The linker will normally set the segment flags based on the sections
which comprise the segment.  You may use the @@code{FLAGS} keyword to
explicitly specify the segment flags.  The value of @@var{flags} must be
an integer.  It is used to set the @@code{p_flags} field of the program

@@cindex symbol versions
@@cindex version script
@@cindex versions of symbols
The linker supports symbol versions when using ELF.  Symbol versions are
only useful when using shared libraries.  The dynamic linker can use
symbol versions to select a specific version of a function when it runs
a program that may have been linked against an earlier version of the
shared library.

You can include a version script directly in the main linker script, or
you can supply the version script as an implicit linker script.  You can
also use the @@samp{--version-script} linker option.

The syntax of the @@code{VERSION} command is simply
@@smallexample
VERSION @@{ version-script-commands @@}
@@end smallexample

The format of the version script commands is identical to that used by
Sun's linker in Solaris 2.5.  The version script defines a tree of
version nodes.  You specify the node names and interdependencies in the
version script.  You can specify which symbols are bound to which
version nodes, and you can reduce a specified set of symbols to local
scope so that they are not globally visible outside of the shared
library.

The easiest way to demonstrate the version script language is with a few
examples.

d2706 1

	 global:
		 foo1;
	 local:
		 old*; 
		 original*; 
		 new*;

@@} VERS_1.1;

VERS_2.0 @@{
		 bar1; bar2;
@@} VERS_1.2;
d2709 21
a2729 311
This example version script defines three version nodes.  The first
version node defined is @@samp{VERS_1.1}; it has no other dependencies.
The script binds the symbol @@samp{foo1} to @@samp{VERS_1.1}.  It reduces
a number of symbols to local scope so that they are not visible outside
of the shared library.

Next, the version script defines node @@samp{VERS_1.2}.  This node
depends upon @@samp{VERS_1.1}.  The script binds the symbol @@samp{foo2}
to the version node @@samp{VERS_1.2}.

Finally, the version script defines node @@samp{VERS_2.0}.  This node
depends upon @@samp{VERS_1.2}.  The scripts binds the symbols @@samp{bar1}
and @@samp{bar2} are bound to the version node @@samp{VERS_2.0}.

When the linker finds a symbol defined in a library which is not
specifically bound to a version node, it will effectively bind it to an
unspecified base version of the library.  You can bind all otherwise
unspecified symbols to a given version node by using @@samp{global: *}
somewhere in the version script.

The names of the version nodes have no specific meaning other than what
they might suggest to the person reading them.  The @@samp{2.0} version
could just as well have appeared in between @@samp{1.1} and @@samp{1.2}.
However, this would be a confusing way to write a version script.

When you link an application against a shared library that has versioned
symbols, the application itself knows which version of each symbol it
requires, and it also knows which version nodes it needs from each
shared library it is linked against.  Thus at runtime, the dynamic
loader can make a quick check to make sure that the libraries you have
linked against do in fact supply all of the version nodes that the
application will need to resolve all of the dynamic symbols.  In this
way it is possible for the dynamic linker to know with certainty that
all external symbols that it needs will be resolvable without having to
search for each symbol reference.

The symbol versioning is in effect a much more sophisticated way of
doing minor version checking that SunOS does.  The fundamental problem
that is being addressed here is that typically references to external
functions are bound on an as-needed basis, and are not all bound when
the application starts up.  If a shared library is out of date, a
required interface may be missing; when the application tries to use
that interface, it may suddenly and unexpectedly fail.  With symbol
versioning, the user will get a warning when they start their program if
the libraries being used with the application are too old.

There are several GNU extensions to Sun's versioning approach.  The
first of these is the ability to bind a symbol to a version node in the
source file where the symbol is defined instead of in the versioning
script.  This was done mainly to reduce the burden on the library
maintainer.  You can do this by putting something like:
@@smallexample
__asm__(".symver original_foo,foo@@@@VERS_1.1");
@@end smallexample
@@noindent
in the C source file.  This renames the function @@samp{original_foo} to
be an alias for @@samp{foo} bound to the version node @@samp{VERS_1.1}.
The @@samp{local:} directive can be used to prevent the symbol
@@samp{original_foo} from being exported.

The second GNU extension is to allow multiple versions of the same
function to appear in a given shared library.  In this way you can make
an incompatible change to an interface without increasing the major
version number of the shared library, while still allowing applications
linked against the old interface to continue to function.

To do this, you must use multiple @@samp{.symver} directives in the
source file.  Here is an example:

@@smallexample
__asm__(".symver original_foo,foo@@@@");
__asm__(".symver old_foo,foo@@@@VERS_1.1");
__asm__(".symver old_foo1,foo@@@@VERS_1.2");
__asm__(".symver new_foo,foo@@@@@@@@VERS_2.0");
@@end smallexample

In this example, @@samp{foo@@@@} represents the symbol @@samp{foo} bound to the
unspecified base version of the symbol.  The source file that contains this
example would define 4 C functions: @@samp{original_foo}, @@samp{old_foo},
@@samp{old_foo1}, and @@samp{new_foo}.

When you have multiple definitions of a given symbol, there needs to be
some way to specify a default version to which external references to
this symbol will be bound.  You can do this with the
@@samp{foo@@@@@@@@VERS_2.0} type of @@samp{.symver} directive.  You can only
declare one version of a symbol as the default in this manner; otherwise
you would effectively have multiple definitions of the same symbol.

If you wish to bind a reference to a specific version of the symbol
within the shared library, you can use the aliases of convenience
(i.e. @@samp{old_foo}), or you can use the @@samp{.symver} directive to
specifically bind to an external version of the function in question.

The linker evaluates expressions lazily.  It only computes the value of
an expression when absolutely necessary.
a2735 20
The linker needs some information, such as the value of the start
address of the first section, and the origins and lengths of memory
regions, in order to do any linking at all.  These values are computed
as soon as possible when the linker reads in the linker script.

However, other values (such as symbol values) are not known or needed
until after storage allocation.  Such values are evaluated later, when
other information (such as the sizes of output sections) is available
for use in the symbol assignment expression.

The sizes of sections cannot be known until after allocation, so
assignments dependent upon these are not performed until after
allocation.

Some expressions, such as those depending upon the location counter
@@samp{.}, must be evaluated during section allocation.

If the result of an expression is required, but the value is not
available, then an error results.  For example, a script like the
following

@@cindex symbols, relocatable and absolute
When the linker evaluates an expression, the result is either absolute
or relative to some section.  A relative expression is expressed as a
fixed offset from the base of a section.

The position of the expression within the linker script determines
whether it is absolute or relative.  An expression which appears within
an output section definition is relative to the base of the output
section.  An expression which appears elsewhere will be absolute.

A symbol set to a relative expression will be relocatable if you request
relocatable output using the @@samp{-r} option.  That means that a
further link operation may change the value of the symbol.  The symbol's
section will be the section of the relative expression.

A symbol set to an absolute expression will retain the same value
through any further link operation.  The symbol will be absolute, and
will not have any particular associated section.

You can use the builtin function @@code{ABSOLUTE} to force an expression
to be absolute when it would otherwise be relative.  For example, to
create an absolute symbol set to the address of the end of the output
section @@samp{.data}:

When generating a shared library, @@code{ld} will by default generate
import stubs suitable for use with a single sub-space application.

@@cindex HPPA stub grouping
@@kindex --stub-group-size=@@var{N}
Long branch stubs and import/export stubs are placed by @@code{ld} in
stub sections located between groups of input sections.
@@samp{--stub-group-size} specifies the maximum size of a group of input
sections handled by one stub section.  Since branch offsets are signed,
a stub section may serve two groups of input sections, one group before
the stub section, and one group after it.  However, when using
conditional branches that require stubs, it may be better (for branch
prediction) that stub sections only serve one group of input sections.
A negative value for @@samp{N} chooses this scheme, ensuring that
branches to stubs always use a negative offset.  Two special values of
@@samp{N} are recognized, @@samp{1} and @@samp{-1}.  These both instruct
@@code{ld} to automatically size input section groups for the branch types
detected, with the same behaviour regarding stub placement as other
positive or negative values of @@samp{N} respectively.

Note that @@samp{--stub-group-size} does not split input sections.  A
single input section larger than the group size specified will of course
create a larger group (of one section).  If input sections are too
large, it may not be possible for a branch to reach its stub.

                   Version 1.1, March 2000

 Copyright (C) 2000  Free Software Foundation, Inc.
  59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA

 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.


0. PREAMBLE

The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
written document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone
the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without
modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.  Secondarily,
this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get
credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for
modifications made by others.

This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
license designed for free software.

We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.


1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a
notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed
under the terms of this License.  The "Document", below, refers to any
such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a licensee, and is
addressed as "you".

A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.

A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject
(or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly
within that overall subject.  (For example, if the Document is in part a
textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any
mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.

The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.

The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.

A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly and
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage
subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.  A copy that is
not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML
or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple
HTML designed for human modification.  Opaque formats include
PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that can be read and edited only
by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
processing tools are not generally available, and the
machine-generated HTML produced by some word processors for output
purposes only.

The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.


2. VERBATIM COPYING

You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.


3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than 100,
and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose
the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.

If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.

If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a publicly-accessible computer-network location containing a complete
Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material, which the
general network-using public has access to download anonymously at no
charge using public-standard network protocols.  If you use the latter
option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin
distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this
Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location
until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque
copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to
the public.

It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.


4. MODIFICATIONS

You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
   from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
   (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
   of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
   if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
   responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
   Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
   Document (all of its principal authors, if it has less than five).
C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
   Modified Version, as the publisher.
D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
   adjacent to the other copyright notices.
F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
   giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
   terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
   and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.
H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
I. Preserve the section entitled "History", and its title, and add to
   it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
   publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
   there is no section entitled "History" in the Document, create one
   stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
   given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
   Version as stated in the previous sentence.
J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
   public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
   the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
   it was based on.  These may be placed in the "History" section.
   You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
   least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
   publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
K. In any section entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
   preserve the section's title, and preserve in the section all the
   substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
   and/or dedications given therein.
L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
   unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
   or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
M. Delete any section entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
   may not be included in the Modified Version.
N. Do not retitle any existing section as "Endorsements"
   or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.

If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

You may add a section entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.

You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.


5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice.

The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled "History"
in the various original documents, forming one section entitled
"History"; likewise combine any sections entitled "Acknowledgements",
and any sections entitled "Dedications".  You must delete all sections
entitled "Endorsements."


6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.

You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.


7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a Modified Version
of the Document, provided no compilation copyright is claimed for the
compilation.  Such a compilation is called an "aggregate", and this
License does not apply to the other self-contained works thus compiled
with the Document, on account of their being thus compiled, if they
are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one quarter
of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that surround only the Document within the aggregate.
Otherwise they must appear on covers around the whole aggregate.


8. TRANSLATION

Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License provided that you also include the
original English version of this License.  In case of a disagreement
between the translation and the original English version of this
License, the original English version will prevail.


9. TERMINATION

You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except
as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other attempt to
copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However,
parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.


10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.

Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.


ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and
license notices just after the title page:

@@smallexample
    Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
    Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
    under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.1
    or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
    with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
    Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.
    A copy of the license is included in the section entitled "GNU
    Free Documentation License".
@@end smallexample

If you have no Invariant Sections, write "with no Invariant Sections"
instead of saying which ones are invariant.  If you have no
Front-Cover Texts, write "no Front-Cover Texts" instead of
"Front-Cover Texts being LIST"; likewise for Back-Cover Texts.

If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
to permit their use in free software.

The @@samp{--no-define-common} option allows decoupling
the decision to assign addresses to Common symbols from the choice
of the output file type; otherwise a non-Relocatable output type
forces assigning addresses to Common symbols.
Using @@samp{--no-define-common} allows Common symbols that are referenced
from a shared library to be assigned addresses only in the main program.
This eliminates the unused duplicate space in the shared library,
and also prevents any possible confusion over resolving to the wrong

Allow (the default) or disallow undefined symbols in shared objects.
The setting of this switch overrides @@samp{--no-undefined} where

that undefined symbols in regular object files will trigger an error,
but undefined symbols in shared objects will be ignored.

The reason that @@samp{--allow-shlib-undefined} is the default is that
the shared object being specified at link time may not be the same one
that is available at load time, so the symbols might actually be
resolvable at load time.  Plus there are some systems, (eg BeOS) where
undefined symbols in shared libraries is normal since the kernel
patches them at load time to select which function is most appropriate
for the current architecture. eg. to dynamically select an appropriate
memset function.  Apparently it is also normal for HPPA shared

@@kindex --enable-auto-import
@@item --enable-auto-import
Do sophisticated linking of @@code{_symbol} to @@code{__imp__symbol} for 
DATA imports from DLLs, and create the necessary thunking symbols when 
building the import libraries with those DATA exports.  This generally 
will 'just work' -- but sometimes you may see this message:

"variable '<var>' can't be auto-imported. Please read the 
documentation for ld's @@code{--enable-auto-import} for details."

This message occurs when some (sub)expression accesses an address 
ultimately given by the sum of two constants (Win32 import tables only 
allow one).  Instances where this may occur include accesses to member 
fields of struct variables imported from a DLL, as well as using a 
constant index into an array variable imported from a DLL.  Any 
multiword variable (arrays, structs, long long, etc) may trigger
this error condition.  However, regardless of the exact data type
of the offending exported variable, ld will always detect it, issue
the warning, and exit.

There are several ways to address this difficulty, regardless of the
data type of the exported variable:

One way is to use --enable-runtime-pseudo-reloc switch. This leaves the task
of adjusting references in your client code for runtime environment, so
this method works only when runtime environtment supports this feature.

A second solution is to force one of the 'constants' to be a variable -- 
that is, unknown and un-optimizable at compile time.  For arrays, 
there are two possibilities: a) make the indexee (the array's address) 
a variable, or b) make the 'constant' index a variable.  Thus:

@@example
extern type extern_array[];
extern_array[1] --> 
   @@{ volatile type *t=extern_array; t[1] @@}
@@end example

or

@@example
extern type extern_array[];
extern_array[1] --> 
   @@{ volatile int t=1; extern_array[t] @@}
@@end example

For structs (and most other multiword data types) the only option 
is to make the struct itself (or the long long, or the ...) variable:

@@example
extern struct s extern_struct;
extern_struct.field --> 
   @@{ volatile struct s *t=&extern_struct; t->field @@}
@@end example

or

@@example
extern long long extern_ll;
extern_ll -->
  @@{ volatile long long * local_ll=&extern_ll; *local_ll @@}
@@end example

A third method of dealing with this difficulty is to abandon
'auto-import' for the offending symbol and mark it with 
@@code{__declspec(dllimport)}.  However, in practice that
requires using compile-time #defines to indicate whether you are
building a DLL, building client code that will link to the DLL, or 
merely building/linking to a static library.   In making the choice 
between the various methods of resolving the 'direct address with 
constant offset' problem, you should consider typical real-world usage:

Original:
@@example
--foo.h
extern int arr[];
--foo.c
#include "foo.h"
void main(int argc, char **argv)@@{
  printf("%d\n",arr[1]);
@@}

Solution 1:
@@example

extern int arr[];

#include "foo.h"
void main(int argc, char **argv)@@{
  /* This workaround is for win32 and cygwin; do not "optimize" */
  volatile int *parr = arr;
  printf("%d\n",parr[1]);
@@}
@@end example

Solution 2:
@@example
--foo.h
/* Note: auto-export is assumed (no __declspec(dllexport)) */
#if (defined(_WIN32) || defined(__CYGWIN__)) && \
  !(defined(FOO_BUILD_DLL) || defined(FOO_STATIC))
#define FOO_IMPORT __declspec(dllimport)
#else
#define FOO_IMPORT
#endif
extern FOO_IMPORT int arr[];
--foo.c
#include "foo.h"
void main(int argc, char **argv)@@{
  printf("%d\n",arr[1]);
@@}
@@end example

A fourth way to avoid this problem is to re-code your 
library to use a functional interface rather than a data interface
for the offending variables (e.g. set_foo() and get_foo() accessor
functions).

@@table @@emph
@@cindex import libraries 
@@item import libraries 
The standard Windows linker creates and uses so-called import
libraries, which contains information for linking to dll's.  They are
regular static archives and are handled as any other static
archive.  The cygwin and mingw ports of @@command{ld} have specific
support for creating such libraries provided with the
@@samp{--out-implib} command line option.

@@item   exporting DLL symbols 
@@cindex exporting DLL symbols 
The cygwin/mingw @@command{ld} has several ways to export symbols for dll's.

@@table @@emph
@@item   using auto-export functionality
@@cindex using auto-export functionality
By default @@command{ld} exports symbols with the auto-export functionality,
which is controlled by the following command line options:

@@itemize
@@item --export-all-symbols   [This is the default]
@@item --exclude-symbols
@@item --exclude-libs
@@end itemize

If, however, @@samp{--export-all-symbols} is not given explicitly on the 
command line, then the default auto-export behavior will be @@emph{disabled}
if either of the following are true:

@@itemize
@@item A DEF file is used.
@@item Any symbol in any object file was marked with the __declspec(dllexport) attribute.
@@end itemize

@@item   using a DEF file 
@@cindex using a DEF file 
Another way of exporting symbols is using a DEF file.  A DEF file is
an ASCII file containing definitions of symbols which should be
exported when a dll is created.  Usually it is named @@samp{<dll
name>.def} and is added as any other object file to the linker's
command line.  The file's name must end in @@samp{.def} or @@samp{.DEF}.

@@example
gcc -o <output> <objectfiles> <dll name>.def
@@end example

Using a DEF file turns off the normal auto-export behavior, unless the
@@samp{--export-all-symbols} option is also used.

Here is an example of a DEF file for a shared library called @@samp{xyz.dll}:

@@example
LIBRARY "xyz.dll" BASE=0x10000000

EXPORTS
foo
bar
_bar = bar
@@end example 

This example defines a base address and three symbols.  The third
symbol is an alias for the second.  For the complete format
specification see ld/deffilep.y in the binutils sources.

@@cindex creating a DEF file
While linking a shared dll, @@command{ld} is able to create a DEF file
with the @@samp{--output-def <file>} command line option.

@@item   Using decorations
@@cindex Using decorations
Another way of marking symbols for export is to modify the source code
itself, so that when building the DLL each symbol to be exported is
declared as:

@@example
__declspec(dllexport) int a_variable
__declspec(dllexport) void a_function(int with_args)
@@end example

All such symbols will be exported from the DLL.  If, however,
any of the object files in the DLL contain symbols decorated in
this way, then the normal auto-export behavior is disabled, unless
the @@samp{--export-all-symbols} option is also used.

Note that object files that wish to access these symbols must @@emph{not}
decorate them with dllexport.  Instead, they should use dllimport, 
instead:

@@example
__declspec(dllimport) int a_variable
__declspec(dllimport) void a_function(int with_args)
@@end example

This complicates the structure of library header files, because 
when included by the library itself the header must declare the 
variables and functions as dllexport, but when included by client
code the header must declare them as dllimport.  There are a number
of idioms that are typically used to do this; often client code can 
omit the __declspec() declaration completely.  See
@@samp{--enable-auto-import} and @@samp{automatic data imports} for more
imformation.
@@end table 

@@cindex automatic data imports
@@item automatic data imports
The standard Windows dll format supports data imports from dlls only
by adding special decorations (dllimport/dllexport), which let the
compiler produce specific assembler instructions to deal with this
issue.  This increases the effort necessary to port existing Un*x 
code to these platforms, especially for large
c++ libraries and applications.  The auto-import feature, which was
initially provided by Paul Sokolovsky, allows one to omit the 
decorations to archieve a behavior that conforms to that on POSIX/Un*x
platforms. This feature is enabled with the @@samp{--enable-auto-import} 
command-line option, although it is enabled by default on cygwin/mingw.
The @@samp{--enable-auto-import} option itself now serves mainly to
suppress any warnings that are ordinarily emitted when linked objects
trigger the feature's use.

auto-import of variables does not always work flawlessly without 
additional assistance.  Sometimes, you will see this message

"variable '<var>' can't be auto-imported. Please read the 
documentation for ld's @@code{--enable-auto-import} for details."

The @@samp{--enable-auto-import} documentation explains why this error 
occurs, and several methods that can be used to overcome this difficulty.  
One of these methods is the @@emph{runtime pseudo-relocs} feature, described 
below.

@@cindex runtime pseudo-relocation
For complex variables imported from DLLs (such as structs or classes), 
object files typically contain a base address for the variable and an 
offset (@@emph{addend}) within the variable--to specify a particular 
field or public member, for instance.  Unfortunately, the runtime loader used 
in win32 environments is incapable of fixing these references at runtime 
without the additional information supplied by dllimport/dllexport decorations.
The standard auto-import feature described above is unable to resolve these 
references.

The @@samp{--enable-runtime-pseudo-relocs} switch allows these references to 
be resolved without error, while leaving the task of adjusting the references 
themselves (with their non-zero addends) to specialized code provided by the 
runtime environment.  Recent versions of the cygwin and mingw environments and 
compilers provide this runtime support; older versions do not.  However, the 
support is only necessary on the developer's platform; the compiled result will 
run without error on an older system.

@@samp{--enable-runtime-pseudo-relocs} is not the default; it must be explicitly 
enabled as needed. 

@@cindex direct linking to a dll
@@item direct linking to a dll
The cygwin/mingw ports of @@command{ld} support the direct linking,
including data symbols, to a dll without the usage of any import
libraries.  This is much faster and uses much less memory than does the
traditional import library method, expecially when linking large
libraries or applications.  When @@command{ld} creates an import lib, each 
function or variable exported from the dll is stored in its own bfd, even 
though a single bfd could contain many exports.  The overhead involved in 
storing, loading, and processing so many bfd's is quite large, and explains the
tremendous time, memory, and storage needed to link against particularly 
large or complex libraries when using import libs.

Linking directly to a dll uses no extra command-line switches other than 
@@samp{-L} and @@samp{-l}, because @@command{ld} already searches for a number
of names to match each library.  All that is needed from the developer's 
perspective is an understanding of this search, in order to force ld to
select the dll instead of an import library.


For instance, when ld is called with the argument @@samp{-lxxx} it will attempt
to find, in the first directory of its search path,

@@example
libxxx.dll.a 
xxx.dll.a 
libxxx.a 
cygxxx.dll (*)
libxxx.dll 
xxx.dll 
@@end example

before moving on to the next directory in the search path.

(*) Actually, this is not @@samp{cygxxx.dll} but in fact is @@samp{<prefix>xxx.dll}, 
where @@samp{<prefix>} is set by the @@command{ld} option 
@@samp{--dll-search-prefix=<prefix>}. In the case of cygwin, the standard gcc spec 
file includes @@samp{--dll-search-prefix=cyg}, so in effect we actually search for 
@@samp{cygxxx.dll}.

Other win32-based unix environments, such as mingw or pw32, may use other 
@@samp{<prefix>}es, although at present only cygwin makes use of this feature.  It 
was originally intended to help avoid name conflicts among dll's built for the
various win32/un*x environments, so that (for example) two versions of a zlib dll
could coexist on the same machine.

The generic cygwin/mingw path layout uses a @@samp{bin} directory for
applications and dll's and a @@samp{lib} directory for the import
libraries (using cygwin nomenclature):

@@example
bin/
	cygxxx.dll
lib/
	libxxx.dll.a   (in case of dll's)
	libxxx.a       (in case of static archive) 
@@end example

Linking directly to a dll without using the import library can be 
done two ways: 

1. Use the dll directly by adding the @@samp{bin} path to the link line
@@example
gcc -Wl,-verbose  -o a.exe -L../bin/ -lxxx
@@end example 

However, as the dll's often have version numbers appended to their names
(@@samp{cygncurses-5.dll}) this will often fail, unless one specifies
@@samp{-L../bin -lncurses-5} to include the version.  Import libs are generally
not versioned, and do not have this difficulty.

2. Create a symbolic link from the dll to a file in the @@samp{lib}
directory according to the above mentioned search pattern.  This
should be used to avoid unwanted changes in the tools needed for
making the app/dll.

@@example
ln -s bin/cygxxx.dll lib/[cyg|lib|]xxx.dll[.a]
@@end example 

Then you can link without any make environment changes.

@@example
gcc -Wl,-verbose  -o a.exe -L../lib/ -lxxx
@@end example 

This technique also avoids the version number problems, because the following is
perfectly legal

@@example
bin/
	cygxxx-5.dll
lib/
	libxxx.dll.a -> ../bin/cygxxx-5.dll 
@@end example

Linking directly to a dll without using an import lib will work
even when auto-import features are exercised, and even when
@@samp{--enable-runtime-pseudo-relocs} is used.

Given the improvements in speed and memory usage, one might justifiably
wonder why import libraries are used at all.  There are two reasons:

1. Until recently, the link-directly-to-dll functionality did @@emph{not}
work with auto-imported data.

2. Sometimes it is necessary to include pure static objects within the
import library (which otherwise contains only bfd's for indirection
symbols that point to the exports of a dll).  Again, the import lib
for the cygwin kernel makes use of this ability, and it is not
possible to do this without an import lib.

So, import libs are not going away.  But the ability to replace
true import libs with a simple symbolic link to (or a copy of) 
a dll, in most cases, is a useful addition to the suite of tools 
binutils makes available to the win32 developer.  Given the 
massive improvements in memory requirements during linking, storage
requirements, and linking speed, we expect that many developers
will soon begin to use this feature whenever possible.

@@item symbol aliasing  
@@table @@emph
@@item adding additional names 
Sometimes, it is useful to export symbols with additional names.  
A symbol @@samp{foo} will be exported as @@samp{foo}, but it can also be
exported as @@samp{_foo} by using special directives in the DEF file
when creating the dll.  This will affect also the optional created
import library.  Consider the following DEF file: 

@@example 
LIBRARY "xyz.dll" BASE=0x61000000

EXPORTS
foo 
_foo = foo
@@end example 

The line @@samp{_foo = foo} maps the symbol @@samp{foo} to @@samp{_foo}.

Another method for creating a symbol alias is to create it in the
source code using the "weak" attribute:

@@example 
void foo () @@{ /* Do something.  */; @@} 
void _foo () __attribute__ ((weak, alias ("foo")));
@@end example 

See the gcc manual for more information about attributes and weak
symbols.

@@item renaming symbols
Sometimes it is useful to rename exports.  For instance, the cygwin
kernel does this regularly.  A symbol @@samp{_foo} can be exported as 
@@samp{foo} but not as @@samp{_foo} by using special directives in the
DEF file. (This will also affect the import library, if it is
created).  In the following example: 

@@example 
LIBRARY "xyz.dll" BASE=0x61000000

EXPORTS
_foo = foo
@@end example 

The line @@samp{_foo = foo} maps the exported symbol @@samp{foo} to
@@samp{_foo}.
@@end table 

Note: using a DEF file disables the default auto-export behavior,
unless the @@samp{--export-all-symbols} command line option is used. 
If, however, you are trying to rename symbols, then you should list
@@emph{all} desired exports in the DEF file, including the symbols 
that are not being renamed, and do @@emph{not} use the 
@@samp{--export-all-symbols} option.  If you list only the 
renamed symbols in the DEF file, and use @@samp{--export-all-symbols} 
to handle the other symbols, then the both the new names @@emph{and} 
the original names for the the renamed symbols will be exported.  
In effect, you'd be aliasing those symbols, not renaming them, 
which is probably not what you wanted.

keep literal pools within the range of PC-relative load offsets.  For

@@command{ld} may interleave some of the @@code{.literal}

group of files followed by the @@code{.text} sections of that group of

the relaxation algorithm ensures that a literal will only be merged with
another literal when the new merged literal location is within the
offset range of all of its uses.

The relaxation mechanism will also attempt to optimize
assembler-generated ``longcall'' sequences of
@@code{L32R}/@@code{CALLX@@var{n}} when the target is known to fit into a

This switch is similar to @@option{--no-undefined} except that it

how undefined symbols in regular object files are handled.

The reason that @@option{--allow-shlib-undefined} is the default is that

the one that is available at load time, so the symbols might actually be

Create a position independent executable.  This is currently only supported on
