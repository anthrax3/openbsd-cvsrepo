@/* Load and run a MIPS position independent ECOFF file.
   Written by Ian Lance Taylor <ian@@cygnus.com>
   Public domain.  */

/* This program will load an ECOFF file into memory and execute it.
   The file must have been compiled using the GNU -membedded-pic
   switch to produce position independent code.  This will only work
   if this program is run on a MIPS system with the same endianness as
   the ECOFF file.  The ECOFF file must be complete.  System calls may
   not work correctly.

   There are further restrictions on the file (they could be removed
   by doing some additional programming).  The file must be aligned
   such that it does not require any gaps introduced in the data
   segment; the GNU linker produces such files by default.  However,
   the file must not assume that the text or data segment is aligned
   on a page boundary.  The start address must be at the start of the
   text segment.

   The ECOFF file is run by calling it as though it were a function.
   The address of the data segment is passed as the only argument.
   The file is expected to return an integer value, which will be
   printed.  */
