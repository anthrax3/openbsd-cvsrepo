@Merge conflicts, bringing our changes back in:
- extra $(SHELL) and sugar for make (so that files not mode +x still work)
- safer temp file handling
- our W^X binary layout changes in ld
- OpenBSD policy for library file selection in ld
- arm and m88k changes which were not merged in time for official 2.15
- bfd core file handling
- a couple typos

New for 2.15:
- ld(1) and as(1) manpages now generated at build time
- binutils/stabs.c reverted to use our in-tree libiberty for now
- we still use our VIA C3 crypto code over stock binutils, as it recognizes
  more instructions
- new emulations for OpenBSD on mips64 machines, to help OpenBSD/sgi
- relaxed %f# handling in gas on OpenBSD/sparc64 (same as was in 2.14)

Tested on all platforms by various people; special thanks to sturm@@ and
otto@@.

.IX Title "LD 1"
.TH LD 1 "2003-06-12" "binutils-2.14" "GNU Development Tools"
.SH "NAME"
ld \- Using LD, the GNU linker
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
ld [\fBoptions\fR] \fIobjfile\fR ...
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\fBld\fR combines a number of object and archive files, relocates
their data and ties up symbol references. Usually the last step in
compiling a program is to run \fBld\fR.
.PP
\&\fBld\fR accepts Linker Command Language files written in
a superset of \s-1AT&T\s0's Link Editor Command Language syntax,
to provide explicit and total control over the linking process.
.PP
This man page does not describe the command language; see the 
\&\fBld\fR entry in \f(CW\*(C`info\*(C'\fR, or the manual
ld: the \s-1GNU\s0 linker, for full details on the command language and 
on other aspects of the \s-1GNU\s0 linker. 
.PP
This version of \fBld\fR uses the general purpose \s-1BFD\s0 libraries
to operate on object files. This allows \fBld\fR to read, combine, and
write object files in many different formats\-\-\-for example, \s-1COFF\s0 or
\&\f(CW\*(C`a.out\*(C'\fR.  Different formats may be linked together to produce any
available kind of object file.  
.PP
Aside from its flexibility, the \s-1GNU\s0 linker is more helpful than other
linkers in providing diagnostic information.  Many linkers abandon
execution immediately upon encountering an error; whenever possible,
\&\fBld\fR continues executing, allowing you to identify other errors
(or, in some cases, to get an output file in spite of the error).
.PP
The \s-1GNU\s0 linker \fBld\fR is meant to cover a broad range of situations,
and to be as compatible as possible with other linkers.  As a result,
you have many choices to control its behavior.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
The linker supports a plethora of command-line options, but in actual
practice few of them are used in any particular context.
For instance, a frequent use of \fBld\fR is to link standard Unix
object files on a standard, supported Unix system.  On such a system, to
link a file \f(CW\*(C`hello.o\*(C'\fR:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        ld -o <output> /lib/crt0.o hello.o -lc
.Ve
.PP
This tells \fBld\fR to produce a file called \fIoutput\fR as the
result of linking the file \f(CW\*(C`/lib/crt0.o\*(C'\fR with \f(CW\*(C`hello.o\*(C'\fR and
the library \f(CW\*(C`libc.a\*(C'\fR, which will come from the standard search
directories.  (See the discussion of the \fB\-l\fR option below.)
.PP
Some of the command-line options to \fBld\fR may be specified at any
point in the command line.  However, options which refer to files, such
as \fB\-l\fR or \fB\-T\fR, cause the file to be read at the point at
which the option appears in the command line, relative to the object
files and other file options.  Repeating non-file options with a
different argument will either have no further effect, or override prior
occurrences (those further to the left on the command line) of that
option.  Options which may be meaningfully specified more than once are
noted in the descriptions below.
.PP
Non-option arguments are object files or archives which are to be linked
together.  They may follow, precede, or be mixed in with command-line
options, except that an object file argument may not be placed between
an option and its argument.
.PP
Usually the linker is invoked with at least one object file, but you can
specify other forms of binary input files using \fB\-l\fR, \fB\-R\fR,
and the script command language.  If \fIno\fR binary input files at all
are specified, the linker does not produce any output, and issues the
message \fBNo input files\fR.
.PP
If the linker cannot recognize the format of an object file, it will
assume that it is a linker script.  A script specified in this way
augments the main linker script used for the link (either the default
linker script or the one specified by using \fB\-T\fR).  This feature
permits the linker to link against a file which appears to be an object
or an archive, but actually merely defines some symbol values, or uses
\&\f(CW\*(C`INPUT\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`GROUP\*(C'\fR to load other objects.  Note that
specifying a script in this way merely augments the main linker script;
use the \fB\-T\fR option to replace the default linker script entirely.
.PP
For options whose names are a single letter,
option arguments must either follow the option letter without intervening
whitespace, or be given as separate arguments immediately following the
option that requires them.
.PP
For options whose names are multiple letters, either one dash or two can
precede the option name; for example, \fB\-trace\-symbol\fR and
\&\fB\-\-trace\-symbol\fR are equivalent.  Note\-\-\-there is one exception to
this rule.  Multiple letter options that start with a lower case 'o' can
only be preceeded by two dashes.  This is to reduce confusion with the
\&\fB\-o\fR option.  So for example \fB\-omagic\fR sets the output file
name to \fBmagic\fR whereas \fB\-\-omagic\fR sets the \s-1NMAGIC\s0 flag on the
output.
.PP
Arguments to multiple-letter options must either be separated from the
option name by an equals sign, or be given as separate arguments
immediately following the option that requires them.  For example,
\&\fB\-\-trace\-symbol foo\fR and \fB\-\-trace\-symbol=foo\fR are equivalent.
Unique abbreviations of the names of multiple-letter options are
accepted.
.PP
Note\-\-\-if the linker is being invoked indirectly, via a compiler driver
(e.g. \fBgcc\fR) then all the linker command line options should be
prefixed by \fB\-Wl,\fR (or whatever is appropriate for the particular
compiler driver) like this:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&          gcc -Wl,--startgroup foo.o bar.o -Wl,--endgroup
.Ve
.PP
This is important, because otherwise the compiler driver program may
silently drop the linker options, resulting in a bad link.
.PP
Here is a table of the generic command line switches accepted by the \s-1GNU\s0
linker:
.IP "\fB\-a\fR\fIkeyword\fR" 4
.IX Item "-akeyword"
This option is supported for \s-1HP/UX\s0 compatibility.  The \fIkeyword\fR
argument must be one of the strings \fBarchive\fR, \fBshared\fR, or
\&\fBdefault\fR.  \fB\-aarchive\fR is functionally equivalent to
\&\fB\-Bstatic\fR, and the other two keywords are functionally equivalent
to \fB\-Bdynamic\fR.  This option may be used any number of times.
.IP "\fB\-A\fR\fIarchitecture\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Aarchitecture"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-architecture=\fR\fIarchitecture\fR" 4
.IX Item "--architecture=architecture"
.PD
In the current release of \fBld\fR, this option is useful only for the
Intel 960 family of architectures.  In that \fBld\fR configuration, the
\&\fIarchitecture\fR argument identifies the particular architecture in
the 960 family, enabling some safeguards and modifying the
archive-library search path.  
.Sp
Future releases of \fBld\fR may support similar functionality for
other architecture families.
.IP "\fB\-b\fR \fIinput-format\fR" 4
.IX Item "-b input-format"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-format=\fR\fIinput-format\fR" 4
.IX Item "--format=input-format"
.PD
\&\fBld\fR may be configured to support more than one kind of object
file.  If your \fBld\fR is configured this way, you can use the
\&\fB\-b\fR option to specify the binary format for input object files
that follow this option on the command line.  Even when \fBld\fR is
configured to support alternative object formats, you don't usually need
to specify this, as \fBld\fR should be configured to expect as a
default input format the most usual format on each machine.
\&\fIinput-format\fR is a text string, the name of a particular format
supported by the \s-1BFD\s0 libraries.  (You can list the available binary
formats with \fBobjdump \-i\fR.)
.Sp
You may want to use this option if you are linking files with an unusual
binary format.  You can also use \fB\-b\fR to switch formats explicitly (when
linking object files of different formats), by including
\&\fB\-b\fR \fIinput-format\fR before each group of object files in a
particular format.
.Sp
The default format is taken from the environment variable
\&\f(CW\*(C`GNUTARGET\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
You can also define the input format from a script, using the command
\&\f(CW\*(C`TARGET\*(C'\fR;
.IP "\fB\-c\fR \fIMRI-commandfile\fR" 4
.IX Item "-c MRI-commandfile"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-mri\-script=\fR\fIMRI-commandfile\fR" 4
.IX Item "--mri-script=MRI-commandfile"
.PD
For compatibility with linkers produced by \s-1MRI\s0, \fBld\fR accepts script
files written in an alternate, restricted command language, described in
the \s-1MRI\s0 Compatible Script Files section of \s-1GNU\s0 ld documentation.
Introduce \s-1MRI\s0 script files with
the option \fB\-c\fR; use the \fB\-T\fR option to run linker
scripts written in the general-purpose \fBld\fR scripting language.
If \fIMRI-cmdfile\fR does not exist, \fBld\fR looks for it in the directories
specified by any \fB\-L\fR options.
.IP "\fB\-d\fR" 4
.IX Item "-d"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-dc\fR" 4
.IX Item "-dc"
.IP "\fB\-dp\fR" 4
.IX Item "-dp"
.PD
These three options are equivalent; multiple forms are supported for
compatibility with other linkers.  They assign space to common symbols
even if a relocatable output file is specified (with \fB\-r\fR).  The
script command \f(CW\*(C`FORCE_COMMON_ALLOCATION\*(C'\fR has the same effect.
.IP "\fB\-e\fR \fIentry\fR" 4
.IX Item "-e entry"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-entry=\fR\fIentry\fR" 4
.IX Item "--entry=entry"
.PD
Use \fIentry\fR as the explicit symbol for beginning execution of your
program, rather than the default entry point.  If there is no symbol
named \fIentry\fR, the linker will try to parse \fIentry\fR as a number,
and use that as the entry address (the number will be interpreted in
base 10; you may use a leading \fB0x\fR for base 16, or a leading
\&\fB0\fR for base 8).  
.IP "\fB\-E\fR" 4
.IX Item "-E"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-export\-dynamic\fR" 4
.IX Item "--export-dynamic"
.PD
When creating a dynamically linked executable, add all symbols to the
dynamic symbol table.  The dynamic symbol table is the set of symbols
which are visible from dynamic objects at run time.
.Sp
If you do not use this option, the dynamic symbol table will normally
contain only those symbols which are referenced by some dynamic object
mentioned in the link.
.Sp
If you use \f(CW\*(C`dlopen\*(C'\fR to load a dynamic object which needs to refer
back to the symbols defined by the program, rather than some other
dynamic object, then you will probably need to use this option when
linking the program itself.
.Sp
You can also use the version script to control what symbols should
be added to the dynamic symbol table if the output format supports it.
See the description of \fB\-\-version\-script\fR in \f(CW@@ref\fR{\s-1VERSION\s0}.
.IP "\fB\-EB\fR" 4
.IX Item "-EB"
Link big-endian objects.  This affects the default output format.
.IP "\fB\-EL\fR" 4
.IX Item "-EL"
Link little-endian objects.  This affects the default output format.
.IP "\fB\-f\fR" 4
.IX Item "-f"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-auxiliary\fR \fIname\fR" 4
.IX Item "--auxiliary name"
.PD
When creating an \s-1ELF\s0 shared object, set the internal \s-1DT_AUXILIARY\s0 field
to the specified name.  This tells the dynamic linker that the symbol
table of the shared object should be used as an auxiliary filter on the
symbol table of the shared object \fIname\fR.
.Sp
If you later link a program against this filter object, then, when you
run the program, the dynamic linker will see the \s-1DT_AUXILIARY\s0 field.  If
the dynamic linker resolves any symbols from the filter object, it will
first check whether there is a definition in the shared object
\&\fIname\fR.  If there is one, it will be used instead of the definition
in the filter object.  The shared object \fIname\fR need not exist.
Thus the shared object \fIname\fR may be used to provide an alternative
implementation of certain functions, perhaps for debugging or for
machine specific performance.
.Sp
This option may be specified more than once.  The \s-1DT_AUXILIARY\s0 entries
will be created in the order in which they appear on the command line.
.IP "\fB\-F\fR \fIname\fR" 4
.IX Item "-F name"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-filter\fR \fIname\fR" 4
.IX Item "--filter name"
.PD
When creating an \s-1ELF\s0 shared object, set the internal \s-1DT_FILTER\s0 field to
the specified name.  This tells the dynamic linker that the symbol table
of the shared object which is being created should be used as a filter
on the symbol table of the shared object \fIname\fR.
.Sp
If you later link a program against this filter object, then, when you
run the program, the dynamic linker will see the \s-1DT_FILTER\s0 field.  The
dynamic linker will resolve symbols according to the symbol table of the
filter object as usual, but it will actually link to the definitions
found in the shared object \fIname\fR.  Thus the filter object can be
used to select a subset of the symbols provided by the object
\&\fIname\fR.

Some older linkers used the \fB\-F\fR option throughout a compilation
toolchain for specifying object-file format for both input and output
object files.
The \s-1GNU\s0 linker uses other mechanisms for this purpose: the
\&\fB\-b\fR, \fB\-\-format\fR, \fB\-\-oformat\fR options, the 
\&\f(CW\*(C`TARGET\*(C'\fR command in linker scripts, and the \f(CW\*(C`GNUTARGET\*(C'\fR
environment variable.
The \s-1GNU\s0 linker will ignore the \fB\-F\fR option when not
creating an \s-1ELF\s0 shared object.
.IP "\fB\-fini\fR \fIname\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fini name"
When creating an \s-1ELF\s0 executable or shared object, call \s-1NAME\s0 when the
executable or shared object is unloaded, by setting \s-1DT_FINI\s0 to the

the function to call.

When creating an \s-1ELF\s0 shared object, set the internal \s-1DT_SONAME\s0 field to
the specified name.  When an executable is linked with a shared object
which has a \s-1DT_SONAME\s0 field, then when the executable is run the dynamic
linker will attempt to load the shared object specified by the \s-1DT_SONAME\s0
field rather than the using the file name given to the linker.
.IP "\fB\-i\fR" 4
.IX Item "-i"
Perform an incremental link (same as option \fB\-r\fR).
.IP "\fB\-init\fR \fIname\fR" 4
.IX Item "-init name"
When creating an \s-1ELF\s0 executable or shared object, call \s-1NAME\s0 when the
executable or shared object is loaded, by setting \s-1DT_INIT\s0 to the address
of the function.  By default, the linker uses \f(CW\*(C`_init\*(C'\fR as the
function to call.

.IX Item "-larchive"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-library=\fR\fIarchive\fR" 4
.IX Item "--library=archive"
.PD
Add archive file \fIarchive\fR to the list of files to link.  This
option may be used any number of times.  \fBld\fR will search its
path-list for occurrences of \f(CW\*(C`lib\f(CIarchive\f(CW.a\*(C'\fR for every
\&\fIarchive\fR specified.
.Sp
On systems which support shared libraries, \fBld\fR may also search for
libraries with extensions other than \f(CW\*(C`.a\*(C'\fR.  Specifically, on \s-1ELF\s0
and SunOS systems, \fBld\fR will search a directory for a library with
an extension of \f(CW\*(C`.so\*(C'\fR before searching for one with an extension of
\&\f(CW\*(C`.a\*(C'\fR.  By convention, a \f(CW\*(C`.so\*(C'\fR extension indicates a shared
library.
.Sp
The linker will search an archive only once, at the location where it is
specified on the command line.  If the archive defines a symbol which
was undefined in some object which appeared before the archive on the
command line, the linker will include the appropriate file(s) from the
archive.  However, an undefined symbol in an object appearing later on
the command line will not cause the linker to search the archive again.
.Sp
See the \fB\-(\fR option for a way to force the linker to search
archives multiple times.
.Sp
You may list the same archive multiple times on the command line.
.Sp
This type of archive searching is standard for Unix linkers.  However,
if you are using \fBld\fR on \s-1AIX\s0, note that it is different from the
behaviour of the \s-1AIX\s0 linker.

.PD
Add path \fIsearchdir\fR to the list of paths that \fBld\fR will search
for archive libraries and \fBld\fR control scripts.  You may use this
option any number of times.  The directories are searched in the order
in which they are specified on the command line.  Directories specified
on the command line are searched before the default directories.  All
\&\fB\-L\fR options apply to all \fB\-l\fR options, regardless of the
order in which the options appear.
.Sp
If \fIsearchdir\fR begins with \f(CW\*(C`=\*(C'\fR, then the \f(CW\*(C`=\*(C'\fR will be replaced
by the \fIsysroot prefix\fR, a path specified when the linker is configured.
.Sp
The default set of paths searched (without being specified with
\&\fB\-L\fR) depends on which emulation mode \fBld\fR is using, and in
some cases also on how it was configured.  
.Sp
The paths can also be specified in a link script with the
\&\f(CW\*(C`SEARCH_DIR\*(C'\fR command.  Directories specified this way are searched
at the point in which the linker script appears in the command line.

Emulate the \fIemulation\fR linker.  You can list the available

.Sp
If the \fB\-m\fR option is not used, the emulation is taken from the

.IP "\fB\-\-no\-omagic\fR" 4

This option negates most of the effects of the \fB\-N\fR option.  It

Generate relocatable output\-\-\-i.e., generate an output file that can in
turn serve as input to \fBld\fR.  This is often called \fIpartial
linking\fR.  As a side effect, in environments that support standard Unix
magic numbers, this option also sets the output file's magic number to
\&\f(CW\*(C`OMAGIC\*(C'\fR.
If this option is not specified, an absolute file is produced.  When
linking \*(C+ programs, this option \fIwill not\fR resolve references to
constructors; to do that, use \fB\-Ur\fR.
.Sp
When an input file does not have the same format as the output file,
partial linking is only supported if that input file does not contain any
relocations.  Different output formats can have further restrictions; for
example some \f(CW\*(C`a.out\*(C'\fR\-based formats do not support partial linking
with input files in other formats at all.

Read symbol names and their addresses from \fIfilename\fR, but do not
relocate it or include it in the output.  This allows your output file
to refer symbolically to absolute locations of memory defined in other
programs.  You may use this option more than once.
.Sp
For compatibility with other \s-1ELF\s0 linkers, if the \fB\-R\fR option is

\&\fIcommandfile\fR must specify everything necessary to describe the

the current directory, \f(CW\*(C`ld\*(C'\fR looks for it in the directories

Force \fIsymbol\fR to be entered in the output file as an undefined

different option arguments to enter additional undefined symbols.  This
option is equivalent to the \f(CW\*(C`EXTERN\*(C'\fR linker script command.
.IP "\fB\-Ur\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Ur"
For anything other than \*(C+ programs, this option is equivalent to
\&\fB\-r\fR: it generates relocatable output\-\-\-i.e., an output file that can in
turn serve as input to \fBld\fR.  When linking \*(C+ programs, \fB\-Ur\fR
\&\fIdoes\fR resolve references to constructors, unlike \fB\-r\fR.
It does not work to use \fB\-Ur\fR on files that were themselves linked
with \fB\-Ur\fR; once the constructor table has been built, it cannot
be added to.  Use \fB\-Ur\fR only for the last partial link, and

The \fIarchives\fR should be a list of archive files.  They may be
either explicit file names, or \fB\-l\fR options.
.Sp
The specified archives are searched repeatedly until no new undefined
references are created.  Normally, an archive is searched only once in
the order that it is specified on the command line.  If a symbol in that
archive is needed to resolve an undefined symbol referred to by an
object in an archive that appears later on the command line, the linker
would not be able to resolve that reference.  By grouping the archives,
they all be searched repeatedly until all possible references are
resolved.

Using this option has a significant performance cost.  It is best to use
it only when there are unavoidable circular references between two or
more archives.

Tells the linker to accept input files whose architecture cannot be

and deliberately wants to link in these unknown input files.  This was
the default behaviour of the linker, before release 2.14.  The default
behaviour from release 2.14 onwards is to reject such input files, and

.IX Item "-Bgroup"
Set the \f(CW\*(C`DF_1_GROUP\*(C'\fR flag in the \f(CW\*(C`DT_FLAGS_1\*(C'\fR entry in the dynamic

When creating a shared library, bind references to global symbols to the

Asks the linker \fInot\fR to check section addresses after they have
been assigned to see if there any overlaps.  Normally the linker will
perform this check, and if it finds any overlaps it will produce
suitable error messages.  The linker does know about, and does make

.IX Item "--cref"
Output a cross reference table.  If a linker map file is being
generated, the cross reference table is printed to the map file.
Otherwise, it is printed on the standard output.
.Sp
The format of the table is intentionally simple, so that it may be
easily processed by a script if necessary.  The symbols are printed out,
sorted by name.  For each symbol, a list of file names is given.  If the
symbol is defined, the first file listed is the location of the
definition.  The remaining files contain references to the symbol.
.IP "\fB\-\-no\-define\-common\fR" 4
.IX Item "--no-define-common"
This option inhibits the assignment of addresses to common symbols.
The script command \f(CW\*(C`INHIBIT_COMMON_ALLOCATION\*(C'\fR has the same effect.
.Sp
The \fB\-\-no\-define\-common\fR option allows decoupling
the decision to assign addresses to Common symbols from the choice
of the output file type; otherwise a non-Relocatable output type
forces assigning addresses to Common symbols.
Using \fB\-\-no\-define\-common\fR allows Common symbols that are referenced
from a shared library to be assigned addresses only in the main program.
This eliminates the unused duplicate space in the shared library,
and also prevents any possible confusion over resolving to the wrong
duplicate when there are many dynamic modules with specialized search
paths for runtime symbol resolution.
.IP "\fB\-\-defsym\fR \fIsymbol\fR\fB=\fR\fIexpression\fR" 4
.IX Item "--defsym symbol=expression"
Create a global symbol in the output file, containing the absolute

times as necessary to define multiple symbols in the command line.  A
limited form of arithmetic is supported for the \fIexpression\fR in this
context: you may give a hexadecimal constant or the name of an existing
symbol, or use \f(CW\*(C`+\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`\-\*(C'\fR to add or subtract hexadecimal
constants or symbols.  If you need more elaborate expressions, consider

.IX Item "--no-demangle"
.PD
These options control whether to demangle symbol names in error messages
and other output.  When the linker is told to demangle, it tries to
present symbol names in a readable fashion: it strips leading
underscores if they are used by the object file format, and converts \*(C+
mangled symbol names into user readable names.  Different compilers have
different mangling styles.  The optional demangling style argument can be used
to choose an appropriate demangling style for your compiler.  The linker will
demangle by default unless the environment variable \fB\s-1COLLECT_NO_DEMANGLE\s0\fR
is set.  These options may be used to override the default.
.IP "\fB\-\-dynamic\-linker\fR \fIfile\fR" 4

This option is only meaningful when linking \s-1MIPS\s0 embedded \s-1PIC\s0 code,
generated by the \-membedded\-pic option to the \s-1GNU\s0 compiler and

.Sp
If a successfully built fully linked output file does not have a

the output file to one of the same name with a \f(CW\*(C`.exe\*(C'\fR suffix. This

\&\fBld\fR normally optimizes for speed over memory usage by caching the

Normally when creating a non-symbolic shared library, undefined symbols
are allowed and left to be resolved by the runtime loader.  This option

.IP "\fB\-\-no\-allow\-shlib\-undefined\fR" 4
.IX Item "--no-allow-shlib-undefined"
.PD
Allow (the default) or disallow undefined symbols in shared objects.
The setting of this switch overrides \fB\-\-no\-undefined\fR where
shared objects are concerned.  Thus if \fB\-\-no\-undefined\fR is set
but \fB\-\-no\-allow\-shlib\-undefined\fR is not, the net result will be
that undefined symbols in regular object files will trigger an error,
but undefined symbols in shared objects will be ignored.
.Sp
The reason that \fB\-\-allow\-shlib\-undefined\fR is the default is that
the shared object being specified at link time may not be the same one
that is available at load time, so the symbols might actually be
resolvable at load time.  Plus there are some systems, (eg BeOS) where
undefined symbols in shared libraries is normal since the kernel
patches them at load time to select which function is most appropriate
for the current architecture. eg. to dynamically select an appropriate
memset function.  Apparently it is also normal for \s-1HPPA\s0 shared
libraries to have undefined symbols.
.IP "\fB\-\-no\-undefined\-version\fR" 4
.IX Item "--no-undefined-version"
Normally when a symbol has an undefined version, the linker will ignore
it. This option disallows symbols with undefined version and a fatal error
will be issued instead.
.IP "\fB\-\-no\-warn\-mismatch\fR" 4
.IX Item "--no-warn-mismatch"
Normally \fBld\fR will give an error if you try to link together input
files that are mismatched for some reason, perhaps because they have
been compiled for different processors or for different endiannesses.
This option tells \fBld\fR that it should silently permit such possible
errors.  This option should only be used with care, in cases when you
have taken some special action that ensures that the linker errors are
inappropriate.

\&\fBld\fR may be configured to support more than one kind of object
file.  If your \fBld\fR is configured this way, you can use the
\&\fB\-\-oformat\fR option to specify the binary format for the output
object file.  Even when \fBld\fR is configured to support alternative
object formats, you don't usually need to specify this, as \fBld\fR
should be configured to produce as a default output format the most
usual format on each machine.  \fIoutput-format\fR is a text string, the
name of a particular format supported by the \s-1BFD\s0 libraries.  (You can
list the available binary formats with \fBobjdump \-i\fR.)  The script
command \f(CW\*(C`OUTPUT_FORMAT\*(C'\fR can also specify the output format, but
this option overrides it.

This option is ignored for \s-1SVR4\s0 compatibility.
.IP "\fB\-\-relax\fR" 4
.IX Item "--relax"
An option with machine dependent effects.
This option is only supported on a few targets.
.Sp
On some platforms, the \fB\-\-relax\fR option performs global
optimizations that become possible when the linker resolves addressing
in the program, such as relaxing address modes and synthesizing new
instructions in the output object file.
.Sp
On some platforms these link time global optimizations may make symbolic
debugging of the resulting executable impossible.
This is known to be
the case for the Matsushita \s-1MN10200\s0 and \s-1MN10300\s0 family of processors.
.Sp
On platforms where this is not supported, \fB\-\-relax\fR is accepted,
but ignored.
.IP "\fB\-\-retain\-symbols\-file\fR \fIfilename\fR" 4
.IX Item "--retain-symbols-file filename"
Retain \fIonly\fR the symbols listed in the file \fIfilename\fR,
discarding all others.  \fIfilename\fR is simply a flat file, with one
symbol name per line.  This option is especially useful in environments
(such as VxWorks)
where a large global symbol table is accumulated gradually, to conserve
run-time memory.
.Sp
\&\fB\-\-retain\-symbols\-file\fR does \fInot\fR discard undefined symbols,
or symbols needed for relocations.
.Sp
You may only specify \fB\-\-retain\-symbols\-file\fR once in the command
line.  It overrides \fB\-s\fR and \fB\-S\fR.
.IP "\fB\-rpath\fR \fIdir\fR" 4
.IX Item "-rpath dir"
Add a directory to the runtime library search path.  This is used when
linking an \s-1ELF\s0 executable with shared objects.  All \fB\-rpath\fR
arguments are concatenated and passed to the runtime linker, which uses
them to locate shared objects at runtime.  The \fB\-rpath\fR option is
also used when locating shared objects which are needed by shared
objects explicitly included in the link; see the description of the
\&\fB\-rpath\-link\fR option.  If \fB\-rpath\fR is not used when linking an
\&\s-1ELF\s0 executable, the contents of the environment variable
\&\f(CW\*(C`LD_RUN_PATH\*(C'\fR will be used if it is defined.
.Sp
The \fB\-rpath\fR option may also be used on SunOS.  By default, on
SunOS, the linker will form a runtime search patch out of all the
\&\fB\-L\fR options it is given.  If a \fB\-rpath\fR option is used, the
runtime search path will be formed exclusively using the \fB\-rpath\fR
options, ignoring the \fB\-L\fR options.  This can be useful when using
gcc, which adds many \fB\-L\fR options which may be on \s-1NFS\s0 mounted
filesystems.
.Sp
For compatibility with other \s-1ELF\s0 linkers, if the \fB\-R\fR option is
followed by a directory name, rather than a file name, it is treated as
the \fB\-rpath\fR option.
.IP "\fB\-rpath\-link\fR \fI\s-1DIR\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-rpath-link DIR"
When using \s-1ELF\s0 or SunOS, one shared library may require another.  This
happens when an \f(CW\*(C`ld \-shared\*(C'\fR link includes a shared library as one
of the input files.
.Sp
When the linker encounters such a dependency when doing a non\-shared,
non-relocatable link, it will automatically try to locate the required
shared library and include it in the link, if it is not included
explicitly.  In such a case, the \fB\-rpath\-link\fR option
specifies the first set of directories to search.  The
\&\fB\-rpath\-link\fR option may specify a sequence of directory names
either by specifying a list of names separated by colons, or by
appearing multiple times.
.Sp
This option should be used with caution as it overrides the search path
that may have been hard compiled into a shared library. In such a case it
is possible to use unintentionally a different search path than the
runtime linker would do.
.Sp
The linker uses the following search paths to locate required shared
libraries.
.RS 4
.IP "1." 4
Any directories specified by \fB\-rpath\-link\fR options.
.IP "2." 4
Any directories specified by \fB\-rpath\fR options.  The difference
between \fB\-rpath\fR and \fB\-rpath\-link\fR is that directories
specified by \fB\-rpath\fR options are included in the executable and
used at runtime, whereas the \fB\-rpath\-link\fR option is only effective
at link time. It is for the native linker only.
.IP "3." 4
On an \s-1ELF\s0 system, if the \fB\-rpath\fR and \f(CW\*(C`rpath\-link\*(C'\fR options

For a native \s-1ELF\s0 linker, the directories in \f(CW\*(C`DT_RUNPATH\*(C'\fR or

libraries needed by it. The \f(CW\*(C`DT_RPATH\*(C'\fR entries are ignored if
\&\f(CW\*(C`DT_RUNPATH\*(C'\fR entries exist.

Create a shared library.  This is currently only supported on \s-1ELF\s0, \s-1XCOFF\s0

undefined symbols in the link.
.IP "\fB\-\-sort\-common\fR" 4

This option tells \fBld\fR to sort the common symbols by size when it
places them in the appropriate output sections.  First come all the one
byte symbols, then all the two byte, then all the four byte, and then
everything else.  This is to prevent gaps between symbols due to
alignment constraints.

.IX Item "--split-by-reloc [count]"
Tries to creates extra sections in the output file so that no single

This is useful when generating huge relocatable files for downloading into
certain real time kernels with the \s-1COFF\s0 object file format; since \s-1COFF\s0
cannot represent more than 65535 relocations in a single section.  Note
that this will fail to work with object file formats which do not
support arbitrary sections.  The linker will not split up individual
input sections for redistribution, so if a single input section contains
more than \fIcount\fR relocations one output section will contain that
many relocations.  \fIcount\fR defaults to a value of 32768.

For example, on SunOS, \fBld\fR combines duplicate entries in the
symbol string table.  This can reduce the size of an output file with
full debugging information by over 30 percent.  Unfortunately, the SunOS
\&\f(CW\*(C`dbx\*(C'\fR program can not read the resulting program (\f(CW\*(C`gdb\*(C'\fR has no

Warn when a common symbol is combined with another common symbol or with
a symbol definition.  Unix linkers allow this somewhat sloppy practice,

you to find potential problems from combining global symbols.
Unfortunately, some C libraries use this practice, so you may get some
warnings about symbols in the libraries as well as in your programs.
.Sp
There are three kinds of global symbols, illustrated here by C examples:
.RS 4
.IP "\fBint i = 1;\fR" 4

A definition, which goes in the initialized data section of the output
file.
.IP "\fBextern int i;\fR" 4
.IX Item "extern int i;"
An undefined reference, which does not allocate space.
There must be either a definition or a common symbol for the
variable somewhere.
.IP "\fBint i;\fR" 4
.IX Item "int i;"
A common symbol.  If there are only (one or more) common symbols for a
variable, it goes in the uninitialized data area of the output file.
The linker merges multiple common symbols for the same variable into a
single symbol.  If they are of different sizes, it picks the largest
size.  The linker turns a common symbol into a declaration, if there is
a definition of the same variable.

The \fB\-\-warn\-common\fR option can produce five kinds of warnings.

a common symbol.

Warn if any global constructors are used.  This is only useful for a few

detect the use of global constructors.
.IP "\fB\-\-warn\-multiple\-gp\fR" 4
.IX Item "--warn-multiple-gp"
Warn if multiple global pointer values are required in the output file.
This is only meaningful for certain processors, such as the Alpha.
Specifically, some processors put large-valued constants in a special
section.  A special register (the global pointer) points into the middle
of this section, so that constants can be loaded efficiently via a
base-register relative addressing mode.  Since the offset in
base-register relative mode is fixed and relatively small (e.g., 16
bits), this limits the maximum size of the constant pool.  Thus, in
large programs, it is often necessary to use multiple global pointer
values in order to be able to address all possible constants.  This
option causes a warning to be issued whenever this case occurs.
.IP "\fB\-\-warn\-once\fR" 4
.IX Item "--warn-once"
Only warn once for each undefined symbol, rather than once per module
which refers to it.
.IP "\fB\-\-warn\-section\-align\fR" 4
.IX Item "--warn-section-align"
Warn if the address of an output section is changed because of
alignment.  Typically, the alignment will be set by an input section.
The address will only be changed if it not explicitly specified; that
is, if the \f(CW\*(C`SECTIONS\*(C'\fR command does not specify a start address for
the section.
.IP "\fB\-\-whole\-archive\fR" 4
.IX Item "--whole-archive"
For each archive mentioned on the command line after the
\&\fB\-\-whole\-archive\fR option, include every object file in the archive
in the link, rather than searching the archive for the required object
files.  This is normally used to turn an archive file into a shared
library, forcing every object to be included in the resulting shared
library.  This option may be used more than once.
.Sp
Two notes when using this option from gcc: First, gcc doesn't know
about this option, so you have to use \fB\-Wl,\-whole\-archive\fR.
Second, don't forget to use \fB\-Wl,\-no\-whole\-archive\fR after your
list of archives, because gcc will add its own list of archives to
your link and you may not want this flag to affect those as well.
.IP "\fB\-\-wrap\fR \fIsymbol\fR" 4

Use a wrapper function for \fIsymbol\fR.  Any undefined reference to
\&\fIsymbol\fR will be resolved to \f(CW\*(C`_\|_wrap_\f(CIsymbol\f(CW\*(C'\fR.  Any
undefined reference to \f(CW\*(C`_\|_real_\f(CIsymbol\f(CW\*(C'\fR will be resolved to
\&\fIsymbol\fR.
.Sp
This can be used to provide a wrapper for a system function.  The
wrapper function should be called \f(CW\*(C`_\|_wrap_\f(CIsymbol\f(CW\*(C'\fR.  If it
wishes to call the system function, it should call
\&\f(CW\*(C`_\|_real_\f(CIsymbol\f(CW\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
Here is a trivial example:
.Sp
.Vb 6
\&        void *
\&        __wrap_malloc (int c)
\&        {
\&          printf ("malloc called with %ld\en", c);
\&          return __real_malloc (c);
\&        }
.Ve
.Sp
If you link other code with this file using \fB\-\-wrap malloc\fR, then
all calls to \f(CW\*(C`malloc\*(C'\fR will call the function \f(CW\*(C`_\|_wrap_malloc\*(C'\fR
instead.  The call to \f(CW\*(C`_\|_real_malloc\*(C'\fR in \f(CW\*(C`_\|_wrap_malloc\*(C'\fR will
call the real \f(CW\*(C`malloc\*(C'\fR function.
.Sp
You may wish to provide a \f(CW\*(C`_\|_real_malloc\*(C'\fR function as well, so that
links without the \fB\-\-wrap\fR option will succeed.  If you do this,
you should not put the definition of \f(CW\*(C`_\|_real_malloc\*(C'\fR in the same
file as \f(CW\*(C`_\|_wrap_malloc\*(C'\fR; if you do, the assembler may resolve the
call before the linker has a chance to wrap it to \f(CW\*(C`malloc\*(C'\fR.

.PD
If the link finds a symbol that it cannot resolve, it will attempt to
do ``fuzzy linking'' by looking for another defined symbol that differs
only in the format of the symbol name (cdecl vs stdcall) and will
resolve that symbol by linking to the match.  For example, the
undefined symbol \f(CW\*(C`_foo\*(C'\fR might be linked to the function
\&\f(CW\*(C`_foo@@12\*(C'\fR, or the undefined symbol \f(CW\*(C`_bar@@16\*(C'\fR might be linked
to the function \f(CW\*(C`_bar\*(C'\fR.  When the linker does this, it prints a
warning, since it normally should have failed to link, but sometimes
import libraries generated from third-party dlls may need this feature
to be usable.  If you specify \fB\-\-enable\-stdcall\-fixup\fR, this
feature is fully enabled and warnings are not printed.  If you specify

be exported by the \s-1DLL\s0.  Note that this is the default if there
otherwise wouldn't be any exported symbols.  When symbols are
explicitly exported via \s-1DEF\s0 files or implicitly exported via function
attributes, the default is to not export anything else unless this
option is given.  Note that the symbols \f(CW\*(C`DllMain@@12\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`DllEntryPoint@@0\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`DllMainCRTStartup@@12\*(C'\fR, and 
\&\f(CW\*(C`impure_ptr\*(C'\fR will not be automatically
exported.  Also, symbols imported from other DLLs will not be 
re\-exported, nor will symbols specifying the \s-1DLL\s0's internal layout 
such as those beginning with \f(CW\*(C`_head_\*(C'\fR or ending with 
\&\f(CW\*(C`_iname\*(C'\fR.  In addition, no symbols from \f(CW\*(C`libgcc\*(C'\fR, 
\&\f(CW\*(C`libstd++\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`libmingw32\*(C'\fR, or \f(CW\*(C`crtX.o\*(C'\fR will be exported.
Symbols whose names begin with \f(CW\*(C`_\|_rtti_\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`_\|_builtin_\*(C'\fR will
not be exported, to help with \*(C+ DLLs.  Finally, there is an
extensive list of cygwin-private symbols that are not exported 
(obviously, this applies on when building DLLs for cygwin targets).
These cygwin-excludes are: \f(CW\*(C`_cygwin_dll_entry@@12\*(C'\fR, 
\&\f(CW\*(C`_cygwin_crt0_common@@8\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`_cygwin_noncygwin_dll_entry@@12\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`_fmode\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`_impure_ptr\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`cygwin_attach_dll\*(C'\fR, 
\&\f(CW\*(C`cygwin_premain0\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`cygwin_premain1\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`cygwin_premain2\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`cygwin_premain3\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`environ\*(C'\fR.

.IP "\fB\-\-exclude\-symbols\fR \fIsymbol\fR\fB,\fR\fIsymbol\fR\fB,...\fR" 4
.IX Item "--exclude-symbols symbol,symbol,..."
Specifies a list of symbols which should not be automatically
exported.  The symbol names may be delimited by commas or colons.
[This option is specific to the i386 \s-1PE\s0 targeted port of the linker]
.IP "\fB\-\-exclude\-libs\fR \fIlib\fR\fB,\fR\fIlib\fR\fB,...\fR" 4
.IX Item "--exclude-libs lib,lib,..."
Specifies a list of archive libraries from which symbols should not be automatically
exported. The library names may be delimited by commas or colons.  Specifying
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-\-exclude\-libs ALL\*(C'\fR excludes symbols in all archive libraries from
automatic export. Symbols explicitly listed in a .def file are still exported,
regardless of this option. 
[This option is specific to the i386 \s-1PE\s0 targeted port of the linker]
.IP "\fB\-\-file\-alignment\fR" 4
.IX Item "--file-alignment"
Specify the file alignment.  Sections in the file will always begin at
file offsets which are multiples of this number.  This defaults to
512.
[This option is specific to the i386 \s-1PE\s0 targeted port of the linker]
.IP "\fB\-\-heap\fR \fIreserve\fR" 4
.IX Item "--heap reserve"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-heap\fR \fIreserve\fR\fB,\fR\fIcommit\fR" 4
.IX Item "--heap reserve,commit"
.PD
Specify the amount of memory to reserve (and optionally commit) to be
used as heap for this program.  The default is 1Mb reserved, 4K
committed.
[This option is specific to the i386 \s-1PE\s0 targeted port of the linker]
.IP "\fB\-\-image\-base\fR \fIvalue\fR" 4
.IX Item "--image-base value"
Use \fIvalue\fR as the base address of your program or dll.  This is
the lowest memory location that will be used when your program or dll
is loaded.  To reduce the need to relocate and improve performance of
your dlls, each should have a unique base address and not overlap any
other dlls.  The default is 0x400000 for executables, and 0x10000000
for dlls.
[This option is specific to the i386 \s-1PE\s0 targeted port of the linker]
.IP "\fB\-\-kill\-at\fR" 4
.IX Item "--kill-at"
If given, the stdcall suffixes (@@\fInn\fR) will be stripped from
symbols before they are exported.

[This option is specific to the i386 \s-1PE\s0 targeted port of the linker]
.IP "\fB\-\-output\-def\fR \fIfile\fR" 4
.IX Item "--output-def file"
The linker will create the file \fIfile\fR which will contain a \s-1DEF\s0
file corresponding to the \s-1DLL\s0 the linker is generating.  This \s-1DEF\s0 file
(which should be called \f(CW\*(C`*.def\*(C'\fR) may be used to create an import
library with \f(CW\*(C`dlltool\*(C'\fR or may be used as a reference to
automatically or implicitly exported symbols.
[This option is specific to the i386 \s-1PE\s0 targeted port of the linker]
.IP "\fB\-\-out\-implib\fR \fIfile\fR" 4
.IX Item "--out-implib file"
The linker will create the file \fIfile\fR which will contain an
import lib corresponding to the \s-1DLL\s0 the linker is generating. This
import lib (which should be called \f(CW\*(C`*.dll.a\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`*.a\*(C'\fR
may be used to link clients against the generated \s-1DLL\s0; this behavior
makes it possible to skip a separate \f(CW\*(C`dlltool\*(C'\fR import library
creation step.
[This option is specific to the i386 \s-1PE\s0 targeted port of the linker]
.IP "\fB\-\-enable\-auto\-image\-base\fR" 4
.IX Item "--enable-auto-image-base"
Automatically choose the image base for DLLs, unless one is specified
using the \f(CW\*(C`\-\-image\-base\*(C'\fR argument.  By using a hash generated
from the dllname to create unique image bases for each \s-1DLL\s0, in-memory
collisions and relocations which can delay program execution are
avoided.
[This option is specific to the i386 \s-1PE\s0 targeted port of the linker]
.IP "\fB\-\-disable\-auto\-image\-base\fR" 4
.IX Item "--disable-auto-image-base"
Do not automatically generate a unique image base.  If there is no
user-specified image base (\f(CW\*(C`\-\-image\-base\*(C'\fR) then use the platform
default.
[This option is specific to the i386 \s-1PE\s0 targeted port of the linker]
.IP "\fB\-\-dll\-search\-prefix\fR \fIstring\fR" 4
.IX Item "--dll-search-prefix string"
When linking dynamically to a dll without an import library,
search for \f(CW\*(C`<string><basename>.dll\*(C'\fR in preference to 
\&\f(CW\*(C`lib<basename>.dll\*(C'\fR. This behavior allows easy distinction
between DLLs built for the various \*(L"subplatforms\*(R": native, cygwin,
uwin, pw, etc.  For instance, cygwin DLLs typically use
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-\-dll\-search\-prefix=cyg\*(C'\fR. 
[This option is specific to the i386 \s-1PE\s0 targeted port of the linker]
.IP "\fB\-\-enable\-auto\-import\fR" 4
.IX Item "--enable-auto-import"
Do sophisticated linking of \f(CW\*(C`_symbol\*(C'\fR to \f(CW\*(C`_\|_imp_\|_symbol\*(C'\fR for 
\&\s-1DATA\s0 imports from DLLs, and create the necessary thunking symbols when 
building the import libraries with those \s-1DATA\s0 exports.  This generally 
will 'just work' \*(-- but sometimes you may see this message:
.Sp
"variable '<var>' can't be auto\-imported. Please read the 
documentation for ld's \f(CW\*(C`\-\-enable\-auto\-import\*(C'\fR for details."
.Sp
This message occurs when some (sub)expression accesses an address 
ultimately given by the sum of two constants (Win32 import tables only 
allow one).  Instances where this may occur include accesses to member 
fields of struct variables imported from a \s-1DLL\s0, as well as using a 
constant index into an array variable imported from a \s-1DLL\s0.  Any 
multiword variable (arrays, structs, long long, etc) may trigger
this error condition.  However, regardless of the exact data type
of the offending exported variable, ld will always detect it, issue
the warning, and exit.
.Sp
There are several ways to address this difficulty, regardless of the
data type of the exported variable:
.Sp
One way is to use \-\-enable\-runtime\-pseudo\-reloc switch. This leaves the task
of adjusting references in your client code for runtime environment, so
this method works only when runtime environtment supports this feature.
.Sp
A second solution is to force one of the 'constants' to be a variable \*(-- 
that is, unknown and un-optimizable at compile time.  For arrays, 
there are two possibilities: a) make the indexee (the array's address) 
a variable, or b) make the 'constant' index a variable.  Thus:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&        extern type extern_array[];
\&        extern_array[1] --> 
\&           { volatile type *t=extern_array; t[1] }
.Ve
.Sp
or
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&        extern type extern_array[];
\&        extern_array[1] --> 
\&           { volatile int t=1; extern_array[t] }
.Ve
.Sp
For structs (and most other multiword data types) the only option 
is to make the struct itself (or the long long, or the ...) variable:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&        extern struct s extern_struct;
\&        extern_struct.field --> 
\&           { volatile struct s *t=&extern_struct; t->field }
.Ve
.Sp
or
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&        extern long long extern_ll;
\&        extern_ll -->
\&          { volatile long long * local_ll=&extern_ll; *local_ll }
.Ve
.Sp
A third method of dealing with this difficulty is to abandon
\&'auto\-import' for the offending symbol and mark it with 
\&\f(CW\*(C`_\|_declspec(dllimport)\*(C'\fR.  However, in practice that
requires using compile-time #defines to indicate whether you are
building a \s-1DLL\s0, building client code that will link to the \s-1DLL\s0, or 
merely building/linking to a static library.   In making the choice 
between the various methods of resolving the 'direct address with 
constant offset' problem, you should consider typical real-world usage:
.Sp
Original:
.Sp
.Vb 7
\&        --foo.h
\&        extern int arr[];
\&        --foo.c
\&        #include "foo.h"
\&        void main(int argc, char **argv){
\&          printf("%d\en",arr[1]);
\&        }
.Ve
.Sp
Solution 1:
.Sp
.Vb 9
\&        --foo.h
\&        extern int arr[];
\&        --foo.c
\&        #include "foo.h"
\&        void main(int argc, char **argv){
\&          /* This workaround is for win32 and cygwin; do not "optimize" */
\&          volatile int *parr = arr;
\&          printf("%d\en",parr[1]);
\&        }
.Ve
.Sp
Solution 2:
.Sp
.Vb 14
\&        --foo.h
\&        /* Note: auto-export is assumed (no __declspec(dllexport)) */
\&        #if (defined(_WIN32) || defined(__CYGWIN__)) && \e
\&          !(defined(FOO_BUILD_DLL) || defined(FOO_STATIC))
\&        #define FOO_IMPORT __declspec(dllimport)
\&        #else
\&        #define FOO_IMPORT
\&        #endif
\&        extern FOO_IMPORT int arr[];
\&        --foo.c
\&        #include "foo.h"
\&        void main(int argc, char **argv){
\&          printf("%d\en",arr[1]);
\&        }
.Ve
.Sp
A fourth way to avoid this problem is to re-code your 
library to use a functional interface rather than a data interface
for the offending variables (e.g. \fIset_foo()\fR and \fIget_foo()\fR accessor
functions).
[This option is specific to the i386 \s-1PE\s0 targeted port of the linker]
.IP "\fB\-\-disable\-auto\-import\fR" 4
.IX Item "--disable-auto-import"
Do not attempt to do sophisticalted linking of \f(CW\*(C`_symbol\*(C'\fR to 
\&\f(CW\*(C`_\|_imp_\|_symbol\*(C'\fR for \s-1DATA\s0 imports from DLLs.
[This option is specific to the i386 \s-1PE\s0 targeted port of the linker]
.IP "\fB\-\-enable\-runtime\-pseudo\-reloc\fR" 4
.IX Item "--enable-runtime-pseudo-reloc"
If your code contains expressions described in \-\-enable\-auto\-import section,
that is, \s-1DATA\s0 imports from \s-1DLL\s0 with non-zero offset, this switch will create
a vector of 'runtime pseudo relocations' which can be used by runtime
environment to adjust references to such data in your client code. 
[This option is specific to the i386 \s-1PE\s0 targeted port of the linker]
.IP "\fB\-\-disable\-runtime\-pseudo\-reloc\fR" 4
.IX Item "--disable-runtime-pseudo-reloc"
Do not create pseudo relocations for non-zero offset \s-1DATA\s0 imports from
DLLs.  This is the default.
[This option is specific to the i386 \s-1PE\s0 targeted port of the linker]
.IP "\fB\-\-enable\-extra\-pe\-debug\fR" 4
.IX Item "--enable-extra-pe-debug"

[This option is specific to the i386 \s-1PE\s0 targeted port of the linker]
.IP "\fB\-\-section\-alignment\fR" 4
.IX Item "--section-alignment"
Sets the section alignment.  Sections in memory will always begin at
addresses which are a multiple of this number.  Defaults to 0x1000.

.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
.IX Header "ENVIRONMENT"
You can change the behavior of \fBld\fR with the environment variables
\&\f(CW\*(C`GNUTARGET\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`LDEMULATION\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`COLLECT_NO_DEMANGLE\*(C'\fR.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`GNUTARGET\*(C'\fR determines the input-file object format if you don't
use \fB\-b\fR (or its synonym \fB\-\-format\fR).  Its value should be one
of the \s-1BFD\s0 names for an input format.  If there is no
\&\f(CW\*(C`GNUTARGET\*(C'\fR in the environment, \fBld\fR uses the natural format
of the target. If \f(CW\*(C`GNUTARGET\*(C'\fR is set to \f(CW\*(C`default\*(C'\fR then \s-1BFD\s0
attempts to discover the input format by examining binary input files;
this method often succeeds, but there are potential ambiguities, since
there is no method of ensuring that the magic number used to specify
object-file formats is unique.  However, the configuration procedure for
\&\s-1BFD\s0 on each system places the conventional format for that system first
in the search\-list, so ambiguities are resolved in favor of convention.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`LDEMULATION\*(C'\fR determines the default emulation if you don't use the
\&\fB\-m\fR option.  The emulation can affect various aspects of linker
behaviour, particularly the default linker script.  You can list the
available emulations with the \fB\-\-verbose\fR or \fB\-V\fR options.  If
the \fB\-m\fR option is not used, and the \f(CW\*(C`LDEMULATION\*(C'\fR environment
variable is not defined, the default emulation depends upon how the
linker was configured.
.PP
Normally, the linker will default to demangling symbols.  However, if
\&\f(CW\*(C`COLLECT_NO_DEMANGLE\*(C'\fR is set in the environment, then it will
default to not demangling symbols.  This environment variable is used in
a similar fashion by the \f(CW\*(C`gcc\*(C'\fR linker wrapper program.  The default
may be overridden by the \fB\-\-demangle\fR and \fB\-\-no\-demangle\fR
options.

.SH DESCRIPTION
\c
.B ld\c
\& combines a number of object and archive files, relocates
their data and ties up symbol references. Often the last step in
building a new compiled program to run is a call to \c
.B ld\c
\&.

\c
.B ld\c
\& accepts Linker Command Language files 
d146 13
a158 26
This man page does not describe the command language; see the `\|\c
.B ld\c
\|' entry in `\|\c
.B info\c
\|', or the manual
.I
ld: the GNU linker
\&, for full details on the command language and on other aspects of
the GNU linker. 

This version of \c
.B ld\c
\& uses the general purpose BFD libraries
to operate on object files. This allows \c
.B ld\c
\& to read, combine, and
write object files in many different formats\(em\&for example, COFF or
\c
.B a.out\c
\&.  Different formats may be linked together to produce any
available kind of object file.  You can use `\|\c
.B objdump \-i\c
\|' to get a list of formats supported on various architectures; see 
.BR objdump ( 1 ).

Aside from its flexibility, the GNU linker is more helpful than other
d161 1
a161 3
\c
.B ld\c
\& continues executing, allowing you to identify other errors
d163 2
a164 4

The GNU linker \c
.B ld\c
\& is meant to cover a broad range of situations,
d166 6
a171 9
you have many choices to control its behavior through the command line,
and through environment variables.

.SH OPTIONS
The plethora of command-line options may seem intimidating, but in
actual practice few of them are used in any particular context.
For instance, a frequent use of \c
.B ld\c
\& is to link standard Unix
d173 16
a188 27
link a file \c
.B hello.o\c
\&:
.sp
.br
$\ ld\ \-o\ output\ /lib/crt0.o\ hello.o\ \-lc
.br
.sp
This tells \c
.B ld\c
\& to produce a file called \c
.B output\c
\& as the
result of linking the file \c
.B /lib/crt0.o\c
\& with \c
.B hello.o\c
\& and
the library \c
.B libc.a\c
\& which will come from the standard search
directories.

The command-line options to \c
.B ld\c
\& may be specified in any order, and
may be repeated at will.  For the most part, repeating an option with a
d190 27
a216 48
occurrences (those further to the left on the command line) of an
option.  

The exceptions\(em\&which may meaningfully be used more than once\(em\&are
\c
.B \-A\c
\&, \c
.B \-b\c
\& (or its synonym \c
.B \-format\c
\&), \c
.B \-defsym\c
\&, \c
.B \-\-section\-start\c
\&, \c
.B \-L\c
\&, \c
.B \-l\c
\&, \c
.B \-R\c
\&, and \c
.B \-u\c
\&.

The list of object files to be linked together, shown as \c
.I objfile\c
\&,
may follow, precede, or be mixed in with command-line options; save that
an \c
.I objfile\c
\& argument may not be placed between an option flag and
its argument.

Usually the linker is invoked with at least one object file, but other
forms of binary input files can also be specified with \c
.B \-l\c
\&,
\c
.B \-R\c
\&, and the script command language.  If \c
.I no\c
\& binary input
files at all are specified, the linker does not produce any output, and
issues the message `\|\c
.B No input files\c
\|'.

Option arguments must either follow the option letter without intervening
d219 51
a269 51

.TP
.BI "-A" "architecture"
In the current release of \c
.B ld\c
\&, this option is useful only for the
Intel 960 family of architectures.  In that \c
.B ld\c
\& configuration, the
\c
.I architecture\c
\& argument is one of the two-letter names identifying
members of the 960 family; the option specifies the desired output
target, and warns of any incompatible instructions in the input files.
It also modifies the linker's search strategy for archive libraries, to
support the use of libraries specific to each particular
architecture, by including in the search loop names suffixed with the
string identifying the architecture.

For example, if your \c
.B ld\c
\& command line included `\|\c
.B \-ACA\c
\|' as
well as `\|\c
.B \-ltry\c
\|', the linker would look (in its built-in search
paths, and in any paths you specify with \c
.B \-L\c
\&) for a library with
the names
.sp
.br
try
.br
libtry.a
.br
tryca
.br
libtryca.a
.br
.sp

The first two possibilities would be considered in any event; the last
two are due to the use of `\|\c
.B \-ACA\c
\|'.

Future releases of \c
.B ld\c
\& may support similar functionality for
d271 17
a287 27

You can meaningfully use \c
.B \-A\c
\& more than once on a command line, if
an architecture family allows combination of target architectures; each
use will add another pair of name variants to search for when \c
.B \-l
specifies a library.

.TP
.BI "\-b " "input-format"
Specify the binary format for input object files that follow this option
on the command line.  You don't usually need to specify this, as
\c
.B ld\c
\& is configured to expect as a default input format the most
usual format on each machine.  \c
.I input-format\c
\& is a text string, the
name of a particular format supported by the BFD libraries.  
\c
.B \-format \c
.I input-format\c
\&\c
\& has the same effect, as does the script command
.BR TARGET .

d289 1
a289 3
binary format.  You can also use \c
.B \-b\c
\& to switch formats explicitly (when
d291 3
a293 7
\c
.B \-b \c
.I input-format\c
\&\c
\& before each group of object files in a
particular format.  

d295 512
a806 13
.B GNUTARGET\c
\&.  You can also define the input
format from a script, using the command \c
.B TARGET\c
\&.

.TP
.B \-Bstatic 
Do not link against shared libraries.  This is only meaningful on
platforms for which shared libraries are supported.

.TP
.B \-Bdynamic
d809 47
a855 48
default on such platforms.

.TP
.B \-Bgroup
Set the \c
.B DF_1_GROUP
\c
flag in the \c
.B DT_FLAGS_1
\c
entry in the dynamic section.  This causes the runtime linker to handle
lookups in this object and its dependencies to be performed only inside
the group.  No undefined symbols are allowed.  This option is only
meaningful on ELF platforms which support shared libraries.

.TP
.B \-Bsymbolic
When creating a shared library, bind references to global symbols to
the definition within the shared library, if any.  Normally, it is
possible for a program linked against a shared library to override the
definition within the shared library.  This option is only meaningful
on ELF platforms which support shared libraries.

.TP
.BI "\-c " "commandfile"
Directs \c
.B ld\c
\& to read link commands from the file
\c
.I commandfile\c
\&.  These commands will completely override \c
.B ld\c
\&'s
default link format (rather than adding to it); \c
.I commandfile\c
\& must
specify everything necessary to describe the target format.


You may also include a script of link commands directly in the command
line by bracketing it between `\|\c
.B {\c
\|' and `\|\c
.B }\c
\|' characters.

.TP
.B \-d 
.TP
.B \-dc
.TP
.B \-dp
These three options are equivalent; multiple forms are supported for
compatibility with other linkers.  Use any of them to make \c
.B ld
assign space to common symbols even if a relocatable output file is
specified (\c
.B \-r\c
\&).  The script command
\c
.B FORCE_COMMON_ALLOCATION\c
\& has the same effect.

.TP
.BI "-defsym " "symbol" "\fR=\fP" expression

d889 17

using the linker command language from a script.

.TP
.B \-\-demangle
.TP
.B \-\-no\-demangle
These options control whether to demangle symbol names in error
messages and other output.  When the linker is told to demangle, it
tries to present symbol names in a readable fashion: it strips leading
underscores if they are used by the object file format, and converts
C++ mangled symbol names into user readable names.  The linker will
demangle by default unless the environment variable
.B COLLECT_NO_DEMANGLE
d907 39
a945 85

.TP
.BI "-e " "entry"\c
\& 
Use \c
.I entry\c
\& as the explicit symbol for beginning execution of your
program, rather than the default entry point.  See the `\|\c
.B ld\c
\|' entry in `\|\c
.B info\c
\|' for a
discussion of defaults and other ways of specifying the
entry point.

.TP
.B \-embedded\-relocs
This option is only meaningful when linking MIPS embedded PIC code,
generated by the
.B \-membedded\-pic
option to the GNU compiler and assembler.  It causes the linker to
create a table which may be used at runtime to relocate any data which
was statically initialized to pointer values.  See the code in
testsuite/ld-empic for details.

.TP
.B \-E
.TP
.B \-export\-dynamic
When creating an ELF file, add all symbols to the dynamic symbol table.
Normally, the dynamic symbol table contains only symbols which are used
by a dynamic object.  This option is needed for some uses of
.I dlopen.

.TP
.BI "-f " "name"
.TP
.BI "--auxiliary " "name"
When creating an ELF shared object, set the internal DT_AUXILIARY field
to the specified name.  This tells the dynamic linker that the symbol
table of the shared object should be used as an auxiliary filter on the
symbol table of the shared object
.I name.

.TP
.BI "-F " "name"
.TP
.BI "--filter " "name"
When creating an ELF shared object, set the internal DT_FILTER field to
the specified name.  This tells the dynamic linker that the symbol table
of the shared object should be used as a filter on the symbol table of
the shared object
.I name.

.TP
.BI "\-format " "input\-format"
Synonym for \c
.B \-b\c
\& \c
.I input\-format\c
\&.

.TP
.B \-g
Accepted, but ignored; provided for compatibility with other tools.

.TP
.BI "\-G " "size"\c
Set the maximum size of objects to be optimized using the GP register
to
.I size
under MIPS ECOFF.  Ignored for other object file formats.

.TP
.BI "-h " "name"
.TP
.BI "-soname " "name"
When creating an ELF shared object, set the internal DT_SONAME field to
the specified name.  When an executable is linked with a shared object
which has a DT_SONAME field, then when the executable is run the dynamic
linker will attempt to load the shared object specified by the DT_SONAME
field rather than the using the file name given to the linker.

.TP
.B \-\-help
d947 77
a1023 106
This option and
.B \-\-version
begin with two dashes instead of one
for compatibility with other GNU programs.  The other options start with
only one dash for compatibility with other linkers.

.TP
.B \-i
Perform an incremental link (same as option \c
.B \-r\c
\&).

.TP
.BI "\-l" "ar"\c
\& 
Add an archive file \c
.I ar\c
\& to the list of files to link.  This 
option may be used any number of times.  \c
.B ld\c
\& will search its
path-list for occurrences of \c
.B lib\c
.I ar\c
\&.a\c
\& for every \c
.I ar
specified.

.TP
.BI "\-L" "searchdir"
This command adds path \c
.I searchdir\c
\& to the list of paths that
\c
.B ld\c
\& will search for archive libraries.  You may use this option
any number of times.

The default set of paths searched (without being specified with
\c
.B \-L\c
\&) depends on what emulation mode \c
.B ld\c
\& is using, and in
some cases also on how it was configured.    The
paths can also be specified in a link script with the \c
.B SEARCH_DIR
command.

.TP
.B \-M 
Print (to the standard output file) a link map\(em\&diagnostic information
about where symbols are mapped by \c
.B ld\c
\&, and information on global
common storage allocation.

.TP
.BI "\-Map " "mapfile"\c
Print to the file
.I mapfile
a link map\(em\&diagnostic information
about where symbols are mapped by \c
.B ld\c
\&, and information on global
common storage allocation.

.TP
.BI "\-m " "emulation"\c
Emulate the
.I emulation
linker.  You can list the available emulations with the
.I \-\-verbose
or
.I \-V
options.  This option overrides the compiled-in default, which is the
system for which you configured
.BR ld .

.TP
.B \-N 
specifies readable and writable \c
.B text\c
\& and \c
.B data\c
\& sections. If
the output format supports Unix style magic numbers, the output is
marked as \c
.B OMAGIC\c
\&.

When you use the `\|\c
.B \-N\c
\&\|' option, the linker does not page-align the
data segment.

.TP
.B \-n 
sets the text segment to be read only, and \c
.B NMAGIC\c
\& is written
if possible.

.TP
.B \-noinhibit\-exec
d1025 59
a1083 109
errors during the link process.  With this flag, you can specify that
you wish the output file retained even after non-fatal errors.

.TP
.B \-no\-keep\-memory
The linker normally optimizes for speed over memory usage by caching
the symbol tables of input files in memory.  This option tells the
linker to instead optimize for memory usage, by rereading the symbol
tables as necessary.  This may be required if the linker runs out of
memory space while linking a large executable.

.TP
.B \-no\-warn\-mismatch
Normally the linker will give an error if you try to link together
input files that are mismatched for some reason, perhaps because they
have been compiled for different processors or for different
endiannesses.  This option tells the linker that it should silently
permit such possible errors.  This option should only be used with
care, in cases when you have taken some special action that ensures
that the linker errors are inappropriate.

.TP
.BI "\-o " "output"
.I output\c
\& is a name for the program produced by \c
.B ld\c
\&; if this
option is not specified, the name `\|\c
.B a.out\c
\|' is used by default.  The
script command \c
.B OUTPUT\c
\& can also specify the output file name.

.TP
.BI "\-O" "level"
Generate optimized output files.  This might use significantly more
time and therefore probably should be enabled only for generating the
final binary.
\c
.I level\c
\& is supposed to be a numeric value.  Any value greater than zero enables
the optimizations.

.TP
.BI "\--oformat " "output\-format"
Specify the binary format for the output object file.
You don't usually need to specify this, as
\c
.B ld\c
\& is configured to produce as a default output format the most
usual format on each machine.  \c
.I output-format\c
\& is a text string, the
name of a particular format supported by the BFD libraries.  
The script command
.B OUTPUT_FORMAT
can also specify the output format, but this option overrides it.

.TP
.BI "\-R " "filename"
Read symbol names and their addresses from \c
.I filename\c
\&, but do not
relocate it or include it in the output.  This allows your output file
to refer symbolically to absolute locations of memory defined in other
programs.

.TP
.B \-relax
An option with machine dependent effects.  Currently this option is only
supported on the H8/300.

On some platforms, use this option to perform global optimizations that
become possible when the linker resolves addressing in your program, such
as relaxing address modes and synthesizing new instructions in the
output object file.  

On platforms where this is not supported, `\|\c
.B \-relax\c
\&\|' is accepted, but has no effect.

.TP
.B \-r 
Generates relocatable output\(em\&i.e., generate an output file that can in
turn serve as input to \c
.B ld\c
\&.  This is often called \c
.I partial
linking\c
\&.  As a side effect, in environments that support standard Unix
magic numbers, this option also sets the output file's magic number to
\c
.B OMAGIC\c
\&.
If this option is not specified, an absolute file is produced.  When
linking C++ programs, this option \c
.I will not\c
\& resolve references to
constructors; \c
.B \-Ur\c
\& is an alternative. 

This option does the same as \c
.B \-i\c
\&.

.TP
.B \-rpath\ \fIdirectory
d1085 1
a1085 2
linking an ELF executable with shared objects.  All 
.B \-rpath
d1087 26
a1112 39
them to locate shared objects at runtime.  The
.B \-rpath
option is also used when locating shared objects which are needed by
shared objects explicitly included in the link; see the description of
the
.B \-rpath\-link
option.  If
.B \-rpath
is not used when linking an ELF executable, the contents of the
environment variable
.B LD_RUN_PATH
will be used if it is defined.

The
.B \-rpath
option may also be used on SunOS.  By default, on SunOS, the linker
will form a runtime search path out of all the
.B \-L
options it is given.  If a
.B \-rpath
option is used, the runtime search path will be formed exclusively
using the
.B \-rpath
options, ignoring
the
.B \-L
options.  This can be useful when using gcc, which adds many
.B \-L
options which may be on NFS mounted filesystems.

.TP
.B \-rpath\-link\ \fIdirectory
When using ELF or SunOS, one shared library may require another.  This
happens when an
.B ld\ \-shared
link includes a shared library as one of the input files.

When the linker encounters such a dependency when doing a non-shared,
non-relocateable link, it will automatically try to locate the required
d1114 45
a1158 7
explicitly.  In such a case, the
.B \-rpath\-link
option specifies the first set of directories to search.  The
.B \-rpath\-link
option may specify a sequence of directory names either by specifying
a list of names separated by colons, or by appearing multiple times.

d1161 31
a1191 38

.TP
.B \-S 
Omits debugger symbol information (but not all symbols) from the output file.

.TP
.B \-s 
Omits all symbol information from the output file.

.TP
.B \-shared
Create a shared library.  This is currently only supported on ELF and
SunOS platforms (on SunOS it is not required, as the linker will
automatically create a shared library when there are undefined symbols
and the
.B \-e
option is not used).

.TP
.B \-sort\-common
Normally, when
.B ld
places the global common symbols in the appropriate output sections,
it sorts them by size.  First come all the one byte symbols, then all
the two bytes, then all the four bytes, and then everything else.
This is to prevent gaps between symbols due to
alignment constraints.  This option disables that sorting.

.TP
.B \-split\-by\-reloc\ \fIcount
Trys to creates extra sections in the output file so that no single
output section in the file contains more than
.I count
relocations.
This is useful when generating huge relocatable for downloading into
certain real time kernels with the COFF object file format; since COFF
cannot represent more than 65535 relocations in a single section.
Note that this will fail to work with object file formats which do not
d1193 21
a1213 13
input sections for redistribution, so if a single input section
contains more than
.I count
relocations one output section will contain that many relocations.

but creates a new output section for each input file.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
\c
You can change the behavior of
.B ld\c
\& with the environment variable \c
.B GNUTARGET\c
\&.

\c
.B GNUTARGET\c
\& determines the input-file object format if you don't
use \c
.B \-b\c
\& (or its synonym \c
.B \-format\c
\&).  Its value should be one
of the BFD names for an input format.  If there is no
\c

\& in the environment, \c
.B ld\c
\& uses the natural format
of the host. If \c
.B GNUTARGET\c
\& is set to \c

\& then BFD attempts to discover the
input format by examining binary input files; this method often
succeeds, but there are potential ambiguities, since there is no method
of ensuring that the magic number used to flag object-file formats is
unique.  However, the configuration procedure for BFD on each system
places the conventional format for that system first in the search-list,
so ambiguities are resolved in favor of convention.

\"    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim
\"    copies of this license document, but changing it is
\"    not allowed.
\"  .PP
\"  0. PREAMBLE
\"  .PP
\"  The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
\"  written document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone
\"  the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without
\"  modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.  Secondarily,
\"  this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get
\"  credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for
\"  modifications made by others.
\"  .PP
\"  This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
\"  works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
\"  complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
\"  license designed for free software.
\"  .PP
\"  We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
\"  software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
\"  program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
\"  software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
\"  it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
\"  whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
\"  principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.
\"  .PP
\"  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS
\"  .PP
\"  This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a
\"  notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed
\"  under the terms of this License.  The "Document", below, refers to any
\"  such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a licensee, and is
\"  addressed as "you".
\"  .PP
\"  A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
\"  Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
\"  modifications and/or translated into another language.
\"  .PP
\"  A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
\"  the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
\"  publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject
\"  (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly
\"  within that overall subject.  (For example, if the Document is in part a
\"  textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any
\"  mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
\"  connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
\"  commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
\"  them.
\"  .PP
\"  The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
\"  are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
\"  that says that the Document is released under this License.
\"  .PP
\"  The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed,
\"  as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
\"  the Document is released under this License.
\"  .PP
\"  A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
\"  represented in a format whose specification is available to the
\"  general public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly and
\"  straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
\"  pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
\"  drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
\"  for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
\"  to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
\"  format whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage
\"  subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.  A copy that is
\"  not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".
\"  .PP
\"  Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
\"  ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML
\"  or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple
\"  HTML designed for human modification.  Opaque formats include
\"  PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that can be read and edited only
\"  by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
\"  processing tools are not generally available, and the
\"  machine-generated HTML produced by some word processors for output
\"  purposes only.
\"  .PP
\"  The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
\"  plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
\"  this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
\"  formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means
\"  the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
\"  preceding the beginning of the body of the text.
\"  .PP
\"  2. VERBATIM COPYING
\"  .PP
\"  You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
\"  commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
\"  copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
\"  to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
\"  conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
\"  technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
\"  copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
\"  compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
\"  number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.
\"  .PP
\"  You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
\"  you may publicly display copies.
\"  .PP
\"  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY
\"  .PP
\"  If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than 100,
\"  and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose
\"  the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
\"  Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
\"  the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
\"  you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
\"  the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
\"  visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.
\"  Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
\"  the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
\"  as verbatim copying in other respects.
\"  .PP
\"  If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
\"  legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
\"  reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
\"  pages.
\"  .PP
\"  If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
\"  more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
\"  copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
\"  a publicly-accessible computer-network location containing a complete
\"  Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material, which the
\"  general network-using public has access to download anonymously at no
\"  charge using public-standard network protocols.  If you use the latter
\"  option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin
\"  distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this
\"  Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location
\"  until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque
\"  copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to
\"  the public.
\"  .PP
\"  It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
\"  Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
\"  them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.
\"  .PP
\"  4. MODIFICATIONS
\"  .PP
\"  You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
\"  the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
\"  the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
\"  Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
\"  and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
\"  of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:
\"  .PP
\"  A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
\"  from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
\"  (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
\"  of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
\"  if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
\"  .PP
\"  B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
\"  responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
\"  Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
\"  Document (all of its principal authors, if it has less than five).
\"  .PP
\"  C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
\"  Modified Version, as the publisher.
\"  .PP
\"  D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
\"  .PP
\"  E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
\"  adjacent to the other copyright notices.
\"  .PP
\"  F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
\"  giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
\"  terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
\"  Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
\"  and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.
\"  .PP
\"  H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
\"  .PP
\"  I. Preserve the section entitled "History", and its title, and add to
\"  it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
\"  publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
\"  there is no section entitled "History" in the Document, create one
\"  stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
\"  given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
\"  Version as stated in the previous sentence.
\"  .PP
\"  J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
\"  public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
\"  the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
\"  it was based on.  These may be placed in the "History" section.
\"  You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
\"  least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
\"  publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
\"  .PP
\"  K. In any section entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
\"  preserve the section's title, and preserve in the section all the
\"  substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
\"  and/or dedications given therein.
\"  .PP
\"  L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
\"  unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
\"  or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
\"  .PP
\"  M. Delete any section entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
\"  may not be included in the Modified Version.
\"  .PP
\"  N. Do not retitle any existing section as "Endorsements"
\"  or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.
\"  .PP
\"  If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
\"  appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
\"  copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
\"  of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
\"  list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.
\"  These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.
\"  .PP
\"  You may add a section entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
\"  nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
\"  parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
\"  been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
\"  standard.
\"  .PP
\"  You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
\"  passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
\"  of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
\"  Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
\"  through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
\"  includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
\"  by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
\"  you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
\"  permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.
\"  .PP
\"  The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
\"  give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
\"  imply endorsement of any Modified Version.
\"  .PP

\"  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS
\"  .PP
\"  You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
\"  License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
\"  versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
\"  Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
\"  list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
\"  license notice.
\"  .PP
\"  The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
\"  multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
\"  copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
\"  different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
\"  adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
\"  author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
\"  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
\"  Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.
\"  .PP
\"  In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled "History"
\"  in the various original documents, forming one section entitled
\"  "History"; likewise combine any sections entitled "Acknowledgements",
\"  and any sections entitled "Dedications".  You must delete all sections
\"  entitled "Endorsements."
\"  .PP

\"  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS
\"  .PP
\"  You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
\"  released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
\"  License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
\"  the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
\"  verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.
\"  .PP
\"  You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
\"  it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
\"  License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
\"  other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.
\"  .PP

\"  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS
\"  .PP
\"  A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
\"  and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
\"  distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a Modified Version
\"  of the Document, provided no compilation copyright is claimed for the
\"  compilation.  Such a compilation is called an "aggregate", and this
\"  License does not apply to the other self-contained works thus compiled
\"  with the Document, on account of their being thus compiled, if they
\"  are not themselves derivative works of the Document.
\"  .PP
\"  If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
\"  copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one quarter
\"  of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
\"  covers that surround only the Document within the aggregate.
\"  Otherwise they must appear on covers around the whole aggregate.
\"  .PP

\"  8. TRANSLATION
\"  .PP
\"  Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
\"  distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
\"  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
\"  permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
\"  translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
\"  original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
\"  translation of this License provided that you also include the
\"  original English version of this License.  In case of a disagreement
\"  between the translation and the original English version of this
\"  License, the original English version will prevail.
\"  .PP

\"  9. TERMINATION
\"  .PP
\"  You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except
\"  as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other attempt to
\"  copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will
\"  automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However,
\"  parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
\"  License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
\"  parties remain in full compliance.
\"  .PP

\"  10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE
\"  .PP
\"  The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
\"  of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
\"  versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
\"  differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
\"  http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.
\"  .PP
\"  Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
\"  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
\"  License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
\"  following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
\"  of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
\"  Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
\"  number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
\"  as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.
\"  .PP

\"  ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
\"  .PP
\"  To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
\"  the License in the document and put the following copyright and
\"  license notices just after the title page:
\"  .PP
\"      Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
\"      Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or
\"      modify this document under the terms of the GNU
\"      Free Documentation License, Version 1.1 or any later
\"      version published by the Free Software Foundation;
\"      with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES,
\"      with the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the
\"      Back-Cover Texts being LIST.  A copy of the license
\"      is included in the section entitled "GNU Free
\"      Documentation License".
\"  .PP
\"  If you have no Invariant Sections, write "with no Invariant Sections"
\"  instead of saying which ones are invariant.  If you have no
\"  Front-Cover Texts, write "no Front-Cover Texts" instead of
\"  "Front-Cover Texts being LIST"; likewise for Back-Cover Texts.
\"  .PP
\"  If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
\"  recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
\"  free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
\"  to permit their use in free software.

to the specified name.  This tells the dynamic linker that the symbol
table of the shared object should be used as an auxiliary filter on the
symbol table of the shared object
.I name.

When creating an ELF shared object, set the internal DT_SONAME field to
the specified name.  When an executable is linked with a shared object
which has a DT_SONAME field, then when the executable is run the dynamic
linker will attempt to load the shared object specified by the DT_SONAME
field rather than the using the file name given to the linker.

These options control whether to demangle symbol names in error
messages and other output.  When the linker is told to demangle, it
tries to present symbol names in a readable fashion: it strips leading
underscores if they are used by the object file format, and converts
C++ mangled symbol names into user readable names.  The linker will
demangle by default unless the environment variable
.B COLLECT_NO_DEMANGLE
is set.  These options may be used to override the default.

Normally the linker will give an error if you try to link together
input files that are mismatched for some reason, perhaps because they
have been compiled for different processors or for different
endiannesses.  This option tells the linker that it should silently
permit such possible errors.  This option should only be used with

that the linker errors are inappropriate.

\"    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim
\"    copies of this license document, but changing it is
\"    not allowed.
\"  .PP
\"  0. PREAMBLE
\"  .PP
\"  The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
\"  written document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone
\"  the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without
\"  modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.  Secondarily,
\"  this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get
\"  credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for
\"  modifications made by others.
\"  .PP
\"  This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
\"  works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
\"  complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
\"  license designed for free software.
\"  .PP
\"  We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
\"  software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
\"  program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
\"  software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
\"  it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
\"  whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
\"  principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.
\"  .PP
\"  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS
\"  .PP
\"  This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a
\"  notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed
\"  under the terms of this License.  The "Document", below, refers to any
\"  such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a licensee, and is
\"  addressed as "you".
\"  .PP
\"  A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
\"  Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
\"  modifications and/or translated into another language.
\"  .PP
\"  A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
\"  the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
\"  publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject
\"  (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly
\"  within that overall subject.  (For example, if the Document is in part a
\"  textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any
\"  mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
\"  connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
\"  commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
\"  them.
\"  .PP
\"  The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
\"  are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
\"  that says that the Document is released under this License.
\"  .PP
\"  The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed,
\"  as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
\"  the Document is released under this License.
\"  .PP
\"  A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
\"  represented in a format whose specification is available to the
\"  general public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly and
\"  straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
\"  pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
\"  drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
\"  for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
\"  to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
\"  format whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage
\"  subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.  A copy that is
\"  not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".
\"  .PP
\"  Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
\"  ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML
\"  or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple
\"  HTML designed for human modification.  Opaque formats include
\"  PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that can be read and edited only
\"  by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
\"  processing tools are not generally available, and the
\"  machine-generated HTML produced by some word processors for output
\"  purposes only.
\"  .PP
\"  The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
\"  plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
\"  this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
\"  formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means
\"  the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
\"  preceding the beginning of the body of the text.
\"  .PP
\"  2. VERBATIM COPYING
\"  .PP
\"  You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
\"  commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
\"  copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
\"  to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
\"  conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
\"  technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
\"  copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
\"  compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
\"  number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.
\"  .PP
\"  You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
\"  you may publicly display copies.
\"  .PP
\"  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY
\"  .PP
\"  If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than 100,
\"  and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose
\"  the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
\"  Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
\"  the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
\"  you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
\"  the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
\"  visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.
\"  Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
\"  the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
\"  as verbatim copying in other respects.
\"  .PP
\"  If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
\"  legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
\"  reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
\"  pages.
\"  .PP
\"  If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
\"  more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
\"  copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
\"  a publicly-accessible computer-network location containing a complete
\"  Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material, which the
\"  general network-using public has access to download anonymously at no
\"  charge using public-standard network protocols.  If you use the latter
\"  option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin
\"  distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this
\"  Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location
\"  until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque
\"  copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to
\"  the public.
\"  .PP
\"  It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
\"  Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
\"  them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.
\"  .PP
\"  4. MODIFICATIONS
\"  .PP
\"  You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
\"  the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
\"  the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
\"  Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
\"  and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
\"  of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:
\"  .PP
\"  A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
\"  from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
\"  (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
\"  of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
\"  if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
\"  .PP
\"  B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
\"  responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
\"  Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
\"  Document (all of its principal authors, if it has less than five).
\"  .PP
\"  C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
\"  Modified Version, as the publisher.
\"  .PP
\"  D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
\"  .PP
\"  E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
\"  adjacent to the other copyright notices.
\"  .PP
\"  F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
\"  giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
\"  terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
\"  Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
\"  and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.
\"  .PP
\"  H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
\"  .PP
\"  I. Preserve the section entitled "History", and its title, and add to
\"  it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
\"  publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
\"  there is no section entitled "History" in the Document, create one
\"  stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
\"  given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
\"  Version as stated in the previous sentence.
\"  .PP
\"  J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
\"  public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
\"  the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
\"  it was based on.  These may be placed in the "History" section.
\"  You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
\"  least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
\"  publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
\"  .PP
\"  K. In any section entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
\"  preserve the section's title, and preserve in the section all the
\"  substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
\"  and/or dedications given therein.
\"  .PP
\"  L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
\"  unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
\"  or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
\"  .PP
\"  M. Delete any section entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
\"  may not be included in the Modified Version.
\"  .PP
\"  N. Do not retitle any existing section as "Endorsements"
\"  or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.
\"  .PP
\"  If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
\"  appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
\"  copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
\"  of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
\"  list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.
\"  These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.
\"  .PP
\"  You may add a section entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
\"  nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
\"  parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
\"  been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
\"  standard.
\"  .PP
\"  You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
\"  passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
\"  of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
\"  Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
\"  through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
\"  includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
\"  by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
\"  you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
\"  permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.
\"  .PP
\"  The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
\"  give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
\"  imply endorsement of any Modified Version.
\"  .PP

\"  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS
\"  .PP
\"  You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
\"  License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
\"  versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
\"  Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
\"  list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
\"  license notice.
\"  .PP
\"  The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
\"  multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
\"  copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
\"  different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
\"  adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
\"  author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
\"  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
\"  Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.
\"  .PP
\"  In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled "History"
\"  in the various original documents, forming one section entitled
\"  "History"; likewise combine any sections entitled "Acknowledgements",
\"  and any sections entitled "Dedications".  You must delete all sections
\"  entitled "Endorsements."
\"  .PP

\"  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS
\"  .PP
\"  You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
\"  released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
\"  License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
\"  the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
\"  verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.
\"  .PP
\"  You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
\"  it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
\"  License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
\"  other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.
\"  .PP

\"  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS
\"  .PP
\"  A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
\"  and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
\"  distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a Modified Version
\"  of the Document, provided no compilation copyright is claimed for the
\"  compilation.  Such a compilation is called an "aggregate", and this
\"  License does not apply to the other self-contained works thus compiled
\"  with the Document, on account of their being thus compiled, if they
\"  are not themselves derivative works of the Document.
\"  .PP
\"  If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
\"  copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one quarter
\"  of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
\"  covers that surround only the Document within the aggregate.
\"  Otherwise they must appear on covers around the whole aggregate.
\"  .PP

\"  8. TRANSLATION
\"  .PP
\"  Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
\"  distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
\"  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
\"  permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
\"  translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
\"  original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
\"  translation of this License provided that you also include the
\"  original English version of this License.  In case of a disagreement
\"  between the translation and the original English version of this
\"  License, the original English version will prevail.
\"  .PP

\"  9. TERMINATION
\"  .PP
\"  You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except
\"  as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other attempt to
\"  copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will
\"  automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However,
\"  parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
\"  License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
\"  parties remain in full compliance.
\"  .PP

\"  10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE
\"  .PP
\"  The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
\"  of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
\"  versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
\"  differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
\"  http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.
\"  .PP
\"  Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
\"  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
\"  License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
\"  following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
\"  of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
\"  Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
\"  number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
\"  as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.
\"  .PP

\"  ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
\"  .PP
\"  To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
\"  the License in the document and put the following copyright and
\"  license notices just after the title page:
\"  .PP
\"      Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
\"      Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or
\"      modify this document under the terms of the GNU
\"      Free Documentation License, Version 1.1 or any later
\"      version published by the Free Software Foundation;
\"      with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES,
\"      with the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the
\"      Back-Cover Texts being LIST.  A copy of the license
\"      is included in the section entitled "GNU Free
\"      Documentation License".
\"  .PP
\"  If you have no Invariant Sections, write "with no Invariant Sections"
\"  instead of saying which ones are invariant.  If you have no
\"  Front-Cover Texts, write "no Front-Cover Texts" instead of
\"  "Front-Cover Texts being LIST"; likewise for Back-Cover Texts.
\"  .PP
\"  If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
\"  recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
\"  free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
\"  to permit their use in free software.

.IX Title "LD 1"
.TH LD 1 "2003-06-12" "binutils-2.14" "GNU Development Tools"
.SH "NAME"
ld \- Using LD, the GNU linker
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
ld [\fBoptions\fR] \fIobjfile\fR ...
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\fBld\fR combines a number of object and archive files, relocates
their data and ties up symbol references. Usually the last step in
compiling a program is to run \fBld\fR.
.PP
\&\fBld\fR accepts Linker Command Language files written in
a superset of \s-1AT&T\s0's Link Editor Command Language syntax,
d176 26
a201 13
.PP
This man page does not describe the command language; see the 
\&\fBld\fR entry in \f(CW\*(C`info\*(C'\fR, or the manual
ld: the \s-1GNU\s0 linker, for full details on the command language and 
on other aspects of the \s-1GNU\s0 linker. 
.PP
This version of \fBld\fR uses the general purpose \s-1BFD\s0 libraries
to operate on object files. This allows \fBld\fR to read, combine, and
write object files in many different formats\-\-\-for example, \s-1COFF\s0 or
\&\f(CW\*(C`a.out\*(C'\fR.  Different formats may be linked together to produce any
available kind of object file.  
.PP
Aside from its flexibility, the \s-1GNU\s0 linker is more helpful than other
d204 3
a206 1
\&\fBld\fR continues executing, allowing you to identify other errors
d208 4
a211 2
.PP
The \s-1GNU\s0 linker \fBld\fR is meant to cover a broad range of situations,
d213 9
a221 6
you have many choices to control its behavior.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
The linker supports a plethora of command-line options, but in actual
practice few of them are used in any particular context.
For instance, a frequent use of \fBld\fR is to link standard Unix
d223 27
a249 16
link a file \f(CW\*(C`hello.o\*(C'\fR:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        ld -o <output> /lib/crt0.o hello.o -lc
.Ve
.PP
This tells \fBld\fR to produce a file called \fIoutput\fR as the
result of linking the file \f(CW\*(C`/lib/crt0.o\*(C'\fR with \f(CW\*(C`hello.o\*(C'\fR and
the library \f(CW\*(C`libc.a\*(C'\fR, which will come from the standard search
directories.  (See the discussion of the \fB\-l\fR option below.)
.PP
Some of the command-line options to \fBld\fR may be specified at any
point in the command line.  However, options which refer to files, such
as \fB\-l\fR or \fB\-T\fR, cause the file to be read at the point at
which the option appears in the command line, relative to the object
files and other file options.  Repeating non-file options with a
d251 48
a298 27
occurrences (those further to the left on the command line) of that
option.  Options which may be meaningfully specified more than once are
noted in the descriptions below.
.PP
Non-option arguments are object files or archives which are to be linked
together.  They may follow, precede, or be mixed in with command-line
options, except that an object file argument may not be placed between
an option and its argument.
.PP
Usually the linker is invoked with at least one object file, but you can
specify other forms of binary input files using \fB\-l\fR, \fB\-R\fR,
and the script command language.  If \fIno\fR binary input files at all
are specified, the linker does not produce any output, and issues the
message \fBNo input files\fR.
.PP
If the linker cannot recognize the format of an object file, it will
assume that it is a linker script.  A script specified in this way
augments the main linker script used for the link (either the default
linker script or the one specified by using \fB\-T\fR).  This feature
permits the linker to link against a file which appears to be an object
or an archive, but actually merely defines some symbol values, or uses
\&\f(CW\*(C`INPUT\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`GROUP\*(C'\fR to load other objects.  Note that
specifying a script in this way merely augments the main linker script;
use the \fB\-T\fR option to replace the default linker script entirely.
.PP
For options whose names are a single letter,
option arguments must either follow the option letter without intervening
d301 51
a351 51
.PP
For options whose names are multiple letters, either one dash or two can
precede the option name; for example, \fB\-trace\-symbol\fR and
\&\fB\-\-trace\-symbol\fR are equivalent.  Note\-\-\-there is one exception to
this rule.  Multiple letter options that start with a lower case 'o' can
only be preceeded by two dashes.  This is to reduce confusion with the
\&\fB\-o\fR option.  So for example \fB\-omagic\fR sets the output file
name to \fBmagic\fR whereas \fB\-\-omagic\fR sets the \s-1NMAGIC\s0 flag on the
output.
.PP
Arguments to multiple-letter options must either be separated from the
option name by an equals sign, or be given as separate arguments
immediately following the option that requires them.  For example,
\&\fB\-\-trace\-symbol foo\fR and \fB\-\-trace\-symbol=foo\fR are equivalent.
Unique abbreviations of the names of multiple-letter options are
accepted.
.PP
Note\-\-\-if the linker is being invoked indirectly, via a compiler driver
(e.g. \fBgcc\fR) then all the linker command line options should be
prefixed by \fB\-Wl,\fR (or whatever is appropriate for the particular
compiler driver) like this:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&          gcc -Wl,--startgroup foo.o bar.o -Wl,--endgroup
.Ve
.PP
This is important, because otherwise the compiler driver program may
silently drop the linker options, resulting in a bad link.
.PP
Here is a table of the generic command line switches accepted by the \s-1GNU\s0
linker:
.IP "\fB\-a\fR\fIkeyword\fR" 4
.IX Item "-akeyword"
This option is supported for \s-1HP/UX\s0 compatibility.  The \fIkeyword\fR
argument must be one of the strings \fBarchive\fR, \fBshared\fR, or
\&\fBdefault\fR.  \fB\-aarchive\fR is functionally equivalent to
\&\fB\-Bstatic\fR, and the other two keywords are functionally equivalent
to \fB\-Bdynamic\fR.  This option may be used any number of times.
.IP "\fB\-A\fR\fIarchitecture\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Aarchitecture"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-architecture=\fR\fIarchitecture\fR" 4
.IX Item "--architecture=architecture"
.PD
In the current release of \fBld\fR, this option is useful only for the
Intel 960 family of architectures.  In that \fBld\fR configuration, the
\&\fIarchitecture\fR argument identifies the particular architecture in
the 960 family, enabling some safeguards and modifying the
archive-library search path.  
.Sp
Future releases of \fBld\fR may support similar functionality for
d353 27
a379 17
.IP "\fB\-b\fR \fIinput-format\fR" 4
.IX Item "-b input-format"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-format=\fR\fIinput-format\fR" 4
.IX Item "--format=input-format"
.PD
\&\fBld\fR may be configured to support more than one kind of object
file.  If your \fBld\fR is configured this way, you can use the
\&\fB\-b\fR option to specify the binary format for input object files
that follow this option on the command line.  Even when \fBld\fR is
configured to support alternative object formats, you don't usually need
to specify this, as \fBld\fR should be configured to expect as a
default input format the most usual format on each machine.
\&\fIinput-format\fR is a text string, the name of a particular format
supported by the \s-1BFD\s0 libraries.  (You can list the available binary
formats with \fBobjdump \-i\fR.)
.Sp
d381 3

binary format.  You can also use \fB\-b\fR to switch formats explicitly (when
d385 7

\&\fB\-b\fR \fIinput-format\fR before each group of object files in a
particular format.
.Sp
d393 13

\&\f(CW\*(C`GNUTARGET\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
You can also define the input format from a script, using the command
\&\f(CW\*(C`TARGET\*(C'\fR;
.IP "\fB\-c\fR \fIMRI-commandfile\fR" 4
.IX Item "-c MRI-commandfile"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-mri\-script=\fR\fIMRI-commandfile\fR" 4
.IX Item "--mri-script=MRI-commandfile"
.PD
For compatibility with linkers produced by \s-1MRI\s0, \fBld\fR accepts script
files written in an alternate, restricted command language, described in
the \s-1MRI\s0 Compatible Script Files section of \s-1GNU\s0 ld documentation.
Introduce \s-1MRI\s0 script files with
the option \fB\-c\fR; use the \fB\-T\fR option to run linker
scripts written in the general-purpose \fBld\fR scripting language.
If \fIMRI-cmdfile\fR does not exist, \fBld\fR looks for it in the directories
specified by any \fB\-L\fR options.
.IP "\fB\-d\fR" 4
.IX Item "-d"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-dc\fR" 4
.IX Item "-dc"
.IP "\fB\-dp\fR" 4
.IX Item "-dp"
.PD
These three options are equivalent; multiple forms are supported for
compatibility with other linkers.  They assign space to common symbols
even if a relocatable output file is specified (with \fB\-r\fR).  The
script command \f(CW\*(C`FORCE_COMMON_ALLOCATION\*(C'\fR has the same effect.
.IP "\fB\-e\fR \fIentry\fR" 4
.IX Item "-e entry"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-entry=\fR\fIentry\fR" 4
.IX Item "--entry=entry"
.PD
Use \fIentry\fR as the explicit symbol for beginning execution of your
program, rather than the default entry point.  If there is no symbol
named \fIentry\fR, the linker will try to parse \fIentry\fR as a number,
and use that as the entry address (the number will be interpreted in
base 10; you may use a leading \fB0x\fR for base 16, or a leading
\&\fB0\fR for base 8).  
.IP "\fB\-E\fR" 4
.IX Item "-E"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-export\-dynamic\fR" 4
.IX Item "--export-dynamic"
.PD
When creating a dynamically linked executable, add all symbols to the
dynamic symbol table.  The dynamic symbol table is the set of symbols
which are visible from dynamic objects at run time.
.Sp
If you do not use this option, the dynamic symbol table will normally
contain only those symbols which are referenced by some dynamic object
mentioned in the link.
.Sp
If you use \f(CW\*(C`dlopen\*(C'\fR to load a dynamic object which needs to refer
back to the symbols defined by the program, rather than some other
dynamic object, then you will probably need to use this option when
linking the program itself.
.Sp
You can also use the version script to control what symbols should
be added to the dynamic symbol table if the output format supports it.
See the description of \fB\-\-version\-script\fR in \f(CW@@ref\fR{\s-1VERSION\s0}.
.IP "\fB\-EB\fR" 4
.IX Item "-EB"
Link big-endian objects.  This affects the default output format.
.IP "\fB\-EL\fR" 4
.IX Item "-EL"
Link little-endian objects.  This affects the default output format.
.IP "\fB\-f\fR" 4
.IX Item "-f"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-auxiliary\fR \fIname\fR" 4
.IX Item "--auxiliary name"
.PD
When creating an \s-1ELF\s0 shared object, set the internal \s-1DT_AUXILIARY\s0 field
to the specified name.  This tells the dynamic linker that the symbol
table of the shared object should be used as an auxiliary filter on the
symbol table of the shared object \fIname\fR.
.Sp
If you later link a program against this filter object, then, when you
run the program, the dynamic linker will see the \s-1DT_AUXILIARY\s0 field.  If
the dynamic linker resolves any symbols from the filter object, it will
first check whether there is a definition in the shared object
\&\fIname\fR.  If there is one, it will be used instead of the definition
in the filter object.  The shared object \fIname\fR need not exist.
Thus the shared object \fIname\fR may be used to provide an alternative
implementation of certain functions, perhaps for debugging or for
machine specific performance.
.Sp
This option may be specified more than once.  The \s-1DT_AUXILIARY\s0 entries
will be created in the order in which they appear on the command line.
.IP "\fB\-F\fR \fIname\fR" 4
.IX Item "-F name"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-filter\fR \fIname\fR" 4
.IX Item "--filter name"
.PD
When creating an \s-1ELF\s0 shared object, set the internal \s-1DT_FILTER\s0 field to
the specified name.  This tells the dynamic linker that the symbol table
of the shared object which is being created should be used as a filter
on the symbol table of the shared object \fIname\fR.
.Sp
If you later link a program against this filter object, then, when you
run the program, the dynamic linker will see the \s-1DT_FILTER\s0 field.  The
dynamic linker will resolve symbols according to the symbol table of the
filter object as usual, but it will actually link to the definitions
found in the shared object \fIname\fR.  Thus the filter object can be
used to select a subset of the symbols provided by the object
\&\fIname\fR.
.Sp
Some older linkers used the \fB\-F\fR option throughout a compilation
toolchain for specifying object-file format for both input and output
object files.
The \s-1GNU\s0 linker uses other mechanisms for this purpose: the
\&\fB\-b\fR, \fB\-\-format\fR, \fB\-\-oformat\fR options, the 
\&\f(CW\*(C`TARGET\*(C'\fR command in linker scripts, and the \f(CW\*(C`GNUTARGET\*(C'\fR
environment variable.
The \s-1GNU\s0 linker will ignore the \fB\-F\fR option when not
creating an \s-1ELF\s0 shared object.
.IP "\fB\-fini\fR \fIname\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fini name"
When creating an \s-1ELF\s0 executable or shared object, call \s-1NAME\s0 when the
executable or shared object is unloaded, by setting \s-1DT_FINI\s0 to the
address of the function.  By default, the linker uses \f(CW\*(C`_fini\*(C'\fR as
the function to call.
.IP "\fB\-g\fR" 4
.IX Item "-g"
Ignored.  Provided for compatibility with other tools.
.IP "\fB\-G\fR\fIvalue\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Gvalue"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-gpsize=\fR\fIvalue\fR" 4
.IX Item "--gpsize=value"
.PD
Set the maximum size of objects to be optimized using the \s-1GP\s0 register to
\&\fIsize\fR.  This is only meaningful for object file formats such as
\&\s-1MIPS\s0 \s-1ECOFF\s0 which supports putting large and small objects into different
sections.  This is ignored for other object file formats.
.IP "\fB\-h\fR\fIname\fR" 4
.IX Item "-hname"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-soname=\fR\fIname\fR" 4
.IX Item "-soname=name"
.PD
When creating an \s-1ELF\s0 shared object, set the internal \s-1DT_SONAME\s0 field to
the specified name.  When an executable is linked with a shared object
which has a \s-1DT_SONAME\s0 field, then when the executable is run the dynamic
linker will attempt to load the shared object specified by the \s-1DT_SONAME\s0
field rather than the using the file name given to the linker.
.IP "\fB\-i\fR" 4
.IX Item "-i"
Perform an incremental link (same as option \fB\-r\fR).
.IP "\fB\-init\fR \fIname\fR" 4
.IX Item "-init name"
When creating an \s-1ELF\s0 executable or shared object, call \s-1NAME\s0 when the
executable or shared object is loaded, by setting \s-1DT_INIT\s0 to the address
of the function.  By default, the linker uses \f(CW\*(C`_init\*(C'\fR as the
function to call.
.IP "\fB\-l\fR\fIarchive\fR" 4
.IX Item "-larchive"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-library=\fR\fIarchive\fR" 4
.IX Item "--library=archive"
.PD
Add archive file \fIarchive\fR to the list of files to link.  This
option may be used any number of times.  \fBld\fR will search its
path-list for occurrences of \f(CW\*(C`lib\f(CIarchive\f(CW.a\*(C'\fR for every
\&\fIarchive\fR specified.
.Sp
On systems which support shared libraries, \fBld\fR may also search for
libraries with extensions other than \f(CW\*(C`.a\*(C'\fR.  Specifically, on \s-1ELF\s0
and SunOS systems, \fBld\fR will search a directory for a library with
an extension of \f(CW\*(C`.so\*(C'\fR before searching for one with an extension of
\&\f(CW\*(C`.a\*(C'\fR.  By convention, a \f(CW\*(C`.so\*(C'\fR extension indicates a shared
library.
.Sp
The linker will search an archive only once, at the location where it is
specified on the command line.  If the archive defines a symbol which
was undefined in some object which appeared before the archive on the
command line, the linker will include the appropriate file(s) from the
archive.  However, an undefined symbol in an object appearing later on
the command line will not cause the linker to search the archive again.
.Sp
See the \fB\-(\fR option for a way to force the linker to search
archives multiple times.
.Sp
You may list the same archive multiple times on the command line.
.Sp
This type of archive searching is standard for Unix linkers.  However,
if you are using \fBld\fR on \s-1AIX\s0, note that it is different from the
behaviour of the \s-1AIX\s0 linker.
.IP "\fB\-L\fR\fIsearchdir\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Lsearchdir"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-library\-path=\fR\fIsearchdir\fR" 4
.IX Item "--library-path=searchdir"
.PD
Add path \fIsearchdir\fR to the list of paths that \fBld\fR will search
for archive libraries and \fBld\fR control scripts.  You may use this
option any number of times.  The directories are searched in the order
in which they are specified on the command line.  Directories specified
on the command line are searched before the default directories.  All
\&\fB\-L\fR options apply to all \fB\-l\fR options, regardless of the
order in which the options appear.
.Sp
If \fIsearchdir\fR begins with \f(CW\*(C`=\*(C'\fR, then the \f(CW\*(C`=\*(C'\fR will be replaced
by the \fIsysroot prefix\fR, a path specified when the linker is configured.
.Sp
The default set of paths searched (without being specified with
\&\fB\-L\fR) depends on which emulation mode \fBld\fR is using, and in
some cases also on how it was configured.  
.Sp
The paths can also be specified in a link script with the
\&\f(CW\*(C`SEARCH_DIR\*(C'\fR command.  Directories specified this way are searched
at the point in which the linker script appears in the command line.
.IP "\fB\-m\fR\fIemulation\fR" 4
.IX Item "-memulation"
Emulate the \fIemulation\fR linker.  You can list the available
emulations with the \fB\-\-verbose\fR or \fB\-V\fR options.
.Sp
If the \fB\-m\fR option is not used, the emulation is taken from the
\&\f(CW\*(C`LDEMULATION\*(C'\fR environment variable, if that is defined.
.Sp
Otherwise, the default emulation depends upon how the linker was
configured.

.IP "\fB\-\-no\-omagic\fR" 4
.IX Item "--no-omagic"
This option negates most of the effects of the \fB\-N\fR option.  It
sets the text section to be read\-only, and forces the data segment to
be page\-aligned.  Note \- this option does not enable linking against
shared libraries.  Use \fB\-Bdynamic\fR for this.

.IX Item "--relocateable"
.PD
Generate relocatable output\-\-\-i.e., generate an output file that can in
turn serve as input to \fBld\fR.  This is often called \fIpartial
linking\fR.  As a side effect, in environments that support standard Unix
magic numbers, this option also sets the output file's magic number to
\&\f(CW\*(C`OMAGIC\*(C'\fR.
If this option is not specified, an absolute file is produced.  When
linking \*(C+ programs, this option \fIwill not\fR resolve references to
constructors; to do that, use \fB\-Ur\fR.
.Sp
When an input file does not have the same format as the output file,
partial linking is only supported if that input file does not contain any
relocations.  Different output formats can have further restrictions; for
example some \f(CW\*(C`a.out\*(C'\fR\-based formats do not support partial linking
with input files in other formats at all.
.Sp

Use \fIscriptfile\fR as the linker script.  This script replaces

For anything other than \*(C+ programs, this option is equivalent to

turn serve as input to \fBld\fR.  When linking \*(C+ programs, \fB\-Ur\fR
\&\fIdoes\fR resolve references to constructors, unlike \fB\-r\fR.
It does not work to use \fB\-Ur\fR on files that were themselves linked

.PD
The \fIarchives\fR should be a list of archive files.  They may be
either explicit file names, or \fB\-l\fR options.
.Sp
The specified archives are searched repeatedly until no new undefined
references are created.  Normally, an archive is searched only once in
the order that it is specified on the command line.  If a symbol in that
archive is needed to resolve an undefined symbol referred to by an
object in an archive that appears later on the command line, the linker
would not be able to resolve that reference.  By grouping the archives,
they all be searched repeatedly until all possible references are
resolved.

Using this option has a significant performance cost.  It is best to use
it only when there are unavoidable circular references between two or
more archives.

Tells the linker to accept input files whose architecture cannot be

The format of the table is intentionally simple, so that it may be
easily processed by a script if necessary.  The symbols are printed out,
sorted by name.  For each symbol, a list of file names is given.  If the
symbol is defined, the first file listed is the location of the
definition.  The remaining files contain references to the symbol.
.IP "\fB\-\-no\-define\-common\fR" 4
.IX Item "--no-define-common"
This option inhibits the assignment of addresses to common symbols.
The script command \f(CW\*(C`INHIBIT_COMMON_ALLOCATION\*(C'\fR has the same effect.
.Sp
The \fB\-\-no\-define\-common\fR option allows decoupling
the decision to assign addresses to Common symbols from the choice
of the output file type; otherwise a non-Relocatable output type
forces assigning addresses to Common symbols.
Using \fB\-\-no\-define\-common\fR allows Common symbols that are referenced
from a shared library to be assigned addresses only in the main program.
This eliminates the unused duplicate space in the shared library,
and also prevents any possible confusion over resolving to the wrong
duplicate when there are many dynamic modules with specialized search
paths for runtime symbol resolution.

These options control whether to demangle symbol names in error messages

present symbol names in a readable fashion: it strips leading
underscores if they are used by the object file format, and converts \*(C+
mangled symbol names into user readable names.  Different compilers have
different mangling styles.  The optional demangling style argument can be used

This option is only meaningful when linking \s-1MIPS\s0 embedded \s-1PIC\s0 code,

.Sp
If a successfully built fully linked output file does not have a

the output file to one of the same name with a \f(CW\*(C`.exe\*(C'\fR suffix. This

Allow (the default) or disallow undefined symbols in shared objects.
The setting of this switch overrides \fB\-\-no\-undefined\fR where
shared objects are concerned.  Thus if \fB\-\-no\-undefined\fR is set
but \fB\-\-no\-allow\-shlib\-undefined\fR is not, the net result will be
that undefined symbols in regular object files will trigger an error,
but undefined symbols in shared objects will be ignored.
.Sp
The reason that \fB\-\-allow\-shlib\-undefined\fR is the default is that
the shared object being specified at link time may not be the same one
that is available at load time, so the symbols might actually be
resolvable at load time.  Plus there are some systems, (eg BeOS) where
undefined symbols in shared libraries is normal since the kernel
patches them at load time to select which function is most appropriate
for the current architecture. eg. to dynamically select an appropriate
memset function.  Apparently it is also normal for \s-1HPPA\s0 shared
libraries to have undefined symbols.
.IP "\fB\-\-no\-undefined\-version\fR" 4

runtime search path will be formed exclusively using the \fB\-rpath\fR
options, ignoring the \fB\-L\fR options.  This can be useful when using
gcc, which adds many \fB\-L\fR options which may be on \s-1NFS\s0 mounted
filesystems.

When using \s-1ELF\s0 or SunOS, one shared library may require another.  This
happens when an \f(CW\*(C`ld \-shared\*(C'\fR link includes a shared library as one
of the input files.
.Sp
When the linker encounters such a dependency when doing a non\-shared,
non-relocatable link, it will automatically try to locate the required

specifies the first set of directories to search.  The
\&\fB\-rpath\-link\fR option may specify a sequence of directory names
either by specifying a list of names separated by colons, or by
appearing multiple times.
.Sp
This option should be used with caution as it overrides the search path
that may have been hard compiled into a shared library. In such a case it

Create a shared library.  This is currently only supported on \s-1ELF\s0, \s-1XCOFF\s0

shared library if the \fB\-e\fR option is not used and there are
undefined symbols in the link.

This option tells \fBld\fR to sort the common symbols by size when it
places them in the appropriate output sections.  First come all the one
byte symbols, then all the two byte, then all the four byte, and then
everything else.  This is to prevent gaps between symbols due to
alignment constraints.

This is useful when generating huge relocatable files for downloading into

cannot represent more than 65535 relocations in a single section.  Note
that this will fail to work with object file formats which do not

For example, on SunOS, \fBld\fR combines duplicate entries in the
symbol string table.  This can reduce the size of an output file with
full debugging information by over 30 percent.  Unfortunately, the SunOS

Unfortunately, some C libraries use this practice, so you may get some

.Sp
There are three kinds of global symbols, illustrated here by C examples:
.RS 4
.IP "\fBint i = 1;\fR" 4
.IX Item "int i = 1;"
A definition, which goes in the initialized data section of the output
file.
.IP "\fBextern int i;\fR" 4
.IX Item "extern int i;"
An undefined reference, which does not allocate space.
There must be either a definition or a common symbol for the
variable somewhere.
.IP "\fBint i;\fR" 4
.IX Item "int i;"
A common symbol.  If there are only (one or more) common symbols for a
variable, it goes in the uninitialized data area of the output file.
The linker merges multiple common symbols for the same variable into a
single symbol.  If they are of different sizes, it picks the largest
size.  The linker turns a common symbol into a declaration, if there is
a definition of the same variable.

The \fB\-\-warn\-common\fR option can produce five kinds of warnings.
Each warning consists of a pair of lines: the first describes the symbol
just encountered, and the second describes the previous symbol

a common symbol.

.IX Item "--warn-constructors"
Warn if any global constructors are used.  This is only useful for a few
object file formats.  For formats like \s-1COFF\s0 or \s-1ELF\s0, the linker can not
detect the use of global constructors.
.IP "\fB\-\-warn\-multiple\-gp\fR" 4
.IX Item "--warn-multiple-gp"
Warn if multiple global pointer values are required in the output file.
This is only meaningful for certain processors, such as the Alpha.
Specifically, some processors put large-valued constants in a special
section.  A special register (the global pointer) points into the middle
of this section, so that constants can be loaded efficiently via a
base-register relative addressing mode.  Since the offset in
base-register relative mode is fixed and relatively small (e.g., 16
bits), this limits the maximum size of the constant pool.  Thus, in
large programs, it is often necessary to use multiple global pointer
values in order to be able to address all possible constants.  This
option causes a warning to be issued whenever this case occurs.

\&\fB\-\-whole\-archive\fR option, include every object file in the archive
in the link, rather than searching the archive for the required object
files.  This is normally used to turn an archive file into a shared
library, forcing every object to be included in the resulting shared
library.  This option may be used more than once.
.Sp
Two notes when using this option from gcc: First, gcc doesn't know
about this option, so you have to use \fB\-Wl,\-whole\-archive\fR.
Second, don't forget to use \fB\-Wl,\-no\-whole\-archive\fR after your
list of archives, because gcc will add its own list of archives to
your link and you may not want this flag to affect those as well.
.IP "\fB\-\-wrap\fR \fIsymbol\fR" 4
.IX Item "--wrap symbol"
Use a wrapper function for \fIsymbol\fR.  Any undefined reference to
\&\fIsymbol\fR will be resolved to \f(CW\*(C`_\|_wrap_\f(CIsymbol\f(CW\*(C'\fR.  Any
undefined reference to \f(CW\*(C`_\|_real_\f(CIsymbol\f(CW\*(C'\fR will be resolved to
\&\fIsymbol\fR.
.Sp
This can be used to provide a wrapper for a system function.  The
wrapper function should be called \f(CW\*(C`_\|_wrap_\f(CIsymbol\f(CW\*(C'\fR.  If it
wishes to call the system function, it should call
\&\f(CW\*(C`_\|_real_\f(CIsymbol\f(CW\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
Here is a trivial example:
.Sp
.Vb 6
\&        void *
\&        __wrap_malloc (int c)
\&        {
\&          printf ("malloc called with %ld\en", c);
\&          return __real_malloc (c);
\&        }
.Ve
.Sp
If you link other code with this file using \fB\-\-wrap malloc\fR, then
all calls to \f(CW\*(C`malloc\*(C'\fR will call the function \f(CW\*(C`_\|_wrap_malloc\*(C'\fR
instead.  The call to \f(CW\*(C`_\|_real_malloc\*(C'\fR in \f(CW\*(C`_\|_wrap_malloc\*(C'\fR will
call the real \f(CW\*(C`malloc\*(C'\fR function.
.Sp
You may wish to provide a \f(CW\*(C`_\|_real_malloc\*(C'\fR function as well, so that
links without the \fB\-\-wrap\fR option will succeed.  If you do this,
you should not put the definition of \f(CW\*(C`_\|_real_malloc\*(C'\fR in the same
file as \f(CW\*(C`_\|_wrap_malloc\*(C'\fR; if you do, the assembler may resolve the
call before the linker has a chance to wrap it to \f(CW\*(C`malloc\*(C'\fR.

use this option.  In addition, the linker fully supports the standard
\&\f(CW\*(C`*.def\*(C'\fR files, which may be specified on the linker command line
like an object file (in fact, it should precede archives it exports
symbols from, to ensure that they get linked in, just like a normal

If the link finds a symbol that it cannot resolve, it will attempt to
do ``fuzzy linking'' by looking for another defined symbol that differs
only in the format of the symbol name (cdecl vs stdcall) and will
resolve that symbol by linking to the match.  For example, the
undefined symbol \f(CW\*(C`_foo\*(C'\fR might be linked to the function
\&\f(CW\*(C`_foo@@12\*(C'\fR, or the undefined symbol \f(CW\*(C`_bar@@16\*(C'\fR might be linked
to the function \f(CW\*(C`_bar\*(C'\fR.  When the linker does this, it prints a
warning, since it normally should have failed to link, but sometimes
import libraries generated from third-party dlls may need this feature
to be usable.  If you specify \fB\-\-enable\-stdcall\-fixup\fR, this
feature is fully enabled and warnings are not printed.  If you specify
\&\fB\-\-disable\-stdcall\-fixup\fR, this feature is disabled and such
mismatches are considered to be errors.

otherwise wouldn't be any exported symbols.  When symbols are
explicitly exported via \s-1DEF\s0 files or implicitly exported via function

option is given.  Note that the symbols \f(CW\*(C`DllMain@@12\*(C'\fR,

constant index into an array variable imported from a \s-1DLL\s0.  Any 
multiword variable (arrays, structs, long long, etc) may trigger
this error condition.  However, regardless of the exact data type
of the offending exported variable, ld will always detect it, issue
the warning, and exit.
.Sp
There are several ways to address this difficulty, regardless of the
data type of the exported variable:
.Sp
One way is to use \-\-enable\-runtime\-pseudo\-reloc switch. This leaves the task
of adjusting references in your client code for runtime environment, so
this method works only when runtime environtment supports this feature.
.Sp
A second solution is to force one of the 'constants' to be a variable \*(-- 
that is, unknown and un-optimizable at compile time.  For arrays, 
there are two possibilities: a) make the indexee (the array's address) 
a variable, or b) make the 'constant' index a variable.  Thus:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&        extern type extern_array[];
\&        extern_array[1] --> 
\&           { volatile type *t=extern_array; t[1] }
.Ve
.Sp
or
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&        extern type extern_array[];
\&        extern_array[1] --> 
\&           { volatile int t=1; extern_array[t] }
.Ve
.Sp
For structs (and most other multiword data types) the only option 
is to make the struct itself (or the long long, or the ...) variable:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&        extern struct s extern_struct;
\&        extern_struct.field --> 
\&           { volatile struct s *t=&extern_struct; t->field }
.Ve
.Sp
or
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&        extern long long extern_ll;
\&        extern_ll -->
\&          { volatile long long * local_ll=&extern_ll; *local_ll }
.Ve
.Sp
A third method of dealing with this difficulty is to abandon
\&'auto\-import' for the offending symbol and mark it with 
\&\f(CW\*(C`_\|_declspec(dllimport)\*(C'\fR.  However, in practice that
requires using compile-time #defines to indicate whether you are
building a \s-1DLL\s0, building client code that will link to the \s-1DLL\s0, or 
merely building/linking to a static library.   In making the choice 
between the various methods of resolving the 'direct address with 
constant offset' problem, you should consider typical real-world usage:
.Sp
Original:
.Sp
.Vb 7
\&        --foo.h
\&        extern int arr[];
\&        --foo.c
\&        #include "foo.h"
\&        void main(int argc, char **argv){
\&          printf("%d\en",arr[1]);
\&        }
.Ve
.Sp
Solution 1:
.Sp
.Vb 9
\&        --foo.h
\&        extern int arr[];
\&        --foo.c
\&        #include "foo.h"
\&        void main(int argc, char **argv){
\&          /* This workaround is for win32 and cygwin; do not "optimize" */
\&          volatile int *parr = arr;
\&          printf("%d\en",parr[1]);
\&        }
.Ve
.Sp
Solution 2:
.Sp
.Vb 14
\&        --foo.h
\&        /* Note: auto-export is assumed (no __declspec(dllexport)) */
\&        #if (defined(_WIN32) || defined(__CYGWIN__)) && \e
\&          !(defined(FOO_BUILD_DLL) || defined(FOO_STATIC))
\&        #define FOO_IMPORT __declspec(dllimport)
\&        #else
\&        #define FOO_IMPORT
\&        #endif
\&        extern FOO_IMPORT int arr[];
\&        --foo.c
\&        #include "foo.h"
\&        void main(int argc, char **argv){
\&          printf("%d\en",arr[1]);
\&        }
.Ve
.Sp
A fourth way to avoid this problem is to re-code your 
library to use a functional interface rather than a data interface
for the offending variables (e.g. \fIset_foo()\fR and \fIget_foo()\fR accessor
functions).

.IX Header "ENVIRONMENT"
You can change the behavior of \fBld\fR with the environment variables
\&\f(CW\*(C`GNUTARGET\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`LDEMULATION\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`COLLECT_NO_DEMANGLE\*(C'\fR.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`GNUTARGET\*(C'\fR determines the input-file object format if you don't
use \fB\-b\fR (or its synonym \fB\-\-format\fR).  Its value should be one
of the \s-1BFD\s0 names for an input format.  If there is no
\&\f(CW\*(C`GNUTARGET\*(C'\fR in the environment, \fBld\fR uses the natural format
of the target. If \f(CW\*(C`GNUTARGET\*(C'\fR is set to \f(CW\*(C`default\*(C'\fR then \s-1BFD\s0
attempts to discover the input format by examining binary input files;
this method often succeeds, but there are potential ambiguities, since
there is no method of ensuring that the magic number used to specify
object-file formats is unique.  However, the configuration procedure for
\&\s-1BFD\s0 on each system places the conventional format for that system first
in the search\-list, so ambiguities are resolved in favor of convention.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`LDEMULATION\*(C'\fR determines the default emulation if you don't use the
\&\fB\-m\fR option.  The emulation can affect various aspects of linker
behaviour, particularly the default linker script.  You can list the
available emulations with the \fB\-\-verbose\fR or \fB\-V\fR options.  If
the \fB\-m\fR option is not used, and the \f(CW\*(C`LDEMULATION\*(C'\fR environment
variable is not defined, the default emulation depends upon how the
linker was configured.
.PP
Normally, the linker will default to demangling symbols.  However, if
\&\f(CW\*(C`COLLECT_NO_DEMANGLE\*(C'\fR is set in the environment, then it will
default to not demangling symbols.  This environment variable is used in
a similar fashion by the \f(CW\*(C`gcc\*(C'\fR linker wrapper program.  The default
may be overridden by the \fB\-\-demangle\fR and \fB\-\-no\-demangle\fR
options.
