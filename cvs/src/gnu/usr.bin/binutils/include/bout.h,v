  If non-zero, the 'n_other' fields indicates either a leaf procedure or
  a system procedure, as follows:
 
 	1 <= n_other <= 32 :
 		The symbol is the entry point to a system procedure.
 		'n_value' is the address of the entry, as for any other
 		procedure.  The system procedure number (which can be used in
 		a 'calls' instruction) is (n_other-1).  These entries come from
 		'.sysproc' directives.
 
 	n_other == N_CALLNAME
 		the symbol is the 'call' entry point to a leaf procedure.
 		The *next* symbol in the symbol table must be the corresponding
 		'bal' entry point to the procedure (see following).  These
 		entries come from '.leafproc' directives in which two different
 		symbols are specified (the first one is represented here).
 	
 
 	n_other == N_BALNAME
 		the symbol is the 'bal' entry point to a leaf procedure.
 		These entries result from '.leafproc' directives in which only
 		one symbol is specified, or in which the same symbol is
 		specified twice.
 
  Note that an N_CALLNAME entry *must* have a corresponding N_BALNAME entry,
  but not every N_BALNAME entry must have an N_CALLNAME entry.  */
