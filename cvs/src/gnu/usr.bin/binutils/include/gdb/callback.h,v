/* This interface isn't intended to be specific to any particular kind
   of remote (hardware, simulator, whatever).  As such, support for it
   (e.g. sim/common/callback.c) should *not* live in the simulator source
   tree, nor should it live in the gdb source tree.  */

/* There are various ways to handle system calls:

   1) Have a simulator intercept the appropriate trap instruction and
   directly perform the system call on behalf of the target program.
   This is the typical way of handling system calls for embedded targets.
   [Handling system calls for embedded targets isn't that much of an
   oxymoron as running compiler testsuites make use of the capability.]

   This method of system call handling is done when STATE_ENVIRONMENT
   is ENVIRONMENT_USER.

   2) Have a simulator emulate the hardware as much as possible.
   If the program running on the real hardware communicates with some sort
   of target manager, one would want to be able to run this program on the
   simulator as well.

   This method of system call handling is done when STATE_ENVIRONMENT
   is ENVIRONMENT_OPERATING.
