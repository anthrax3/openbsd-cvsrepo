@doschk - check filenames for DOS (and SYSV) compatibility

This program is intended as a utility to help software developers
ensure that their source file names are distinguishable on MS-DOS and
14-character SYSV platforms.  To perform this task, doschk reads a
list of filenames and produces a report of all the conflicts that
would arise if the files were transferred to a MS-DOS or SYSV
platform.

To use this program, you must feed it a list of filenames in this
format:

	dir
	dir/file1.ext
	dir/file2.exe
	dir/dir2
	dir/dir2/file3.ext

If the list does not include the directory-only lines (like dir/dir2)
then their names will not be checked for uniqueness, else they will
be.  Typical uses of this program are like these:

	find . -print | doschk
	tar tf file.tar | doschk

If this program produces no output, then all your files are MS-DOS
compatible.  Any output messages are designed to be self-explanatory
and indicate cases where the files will not transfer to MS-DOS without
problems.

Please report bugs to bug-gnu-utils@@prep.ai.mit.edu.
