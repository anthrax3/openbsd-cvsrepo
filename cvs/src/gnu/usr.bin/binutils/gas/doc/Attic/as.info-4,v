HPPA Assembler Directives
-------------------------

   `as' for the HPPA supports many additional directives for
compatibility with the native assembler.  This section describes them
only briefly.  For detailed information on HPPA-specific assembler
directives, see `HP9000 Series 800 Assembly Language Reference Manual'
(HP 92432-90001).

   `as' does *not* support the following assembler directives described
in the HP manual:

     .endm           .liston
     .enter          .locct
     .leave          .macro
     .listoff

   Beyond those implemented for compatibility, `as' supports one
additional assembler directive for the HPPA: `.param'.  It conveys
register argument locations for static functions.  Its syntax closely
follows the `.export' directive.

   These are the additional directives in `as' for the HPPA:

`.block N'
`.blockz N'
     Reserve N bytes of storage, and initialize them to zero.

`.call'
     Mark the beginning of a procedure call.  Only the special case
     with *no arguments* is allowed.

`.callinfo [ PARAM=VALUE, ... ]  [ FLAG, ... ]'
     Specify a number of parameters and flags that define the
     environment for a procedure.

     PARAM may be any of `frame' (frame size), `entry_gr' (end of
     general register range), `entry_fr' (end of float register range),
     `entry_sr' (end of space register range).

     The values for FLAG are `calls' or `caller' (proc has
     subroutines), `no_calls' (proc does not call subroutines),
     `save_rp' (preserve return pointer), `save_sp' (proc preserves
     stack pointer), `no_unwind' (do not unwind this proc), `hpux_int'
     (proc is interrupt routine).

`.code'
     Assemble into the standard section called `$TEXT$', subsection
     `$CODE$'.

`.copyright "STRING"'
     In the SOM object format, insert STRING into the object code,
     marked as a copyright string.

`.copyright "STRING"'
     In the ELF object format, insert STRING into the object code,
     marked as a version string.

`.enter'
     Not yet supported; the assembler rejects programs containing this
     directive.

`.entry'
     Mark the beginning of a procedure.

`.exit'
     Mark the end of a procedure.

`.export NAME [ ,TYP ]  [ ,PARAM=R ]'
     Make a procedure NAME available to callers.  TYP, if present, must
     be one of `absolute', `code' (ELF only, not SOM), `data', `entry',
     `data', `entry', `millicode', `plabel', `pri_prog', or `sec_prog'.

     PARAM, if present, provides either relocation information for the
     procedure arguments and result, or a privilege level.  PARAM may be
     `argwN' (where N ranges from `0' to `3', and indicates one of four
     one-word arguments); `rtnval' (the procedure's result); or
     `priv_lev' (privilege level).  For arguments or the result, R
     specifies how to relocate, and must be one of `no' (not
     relocatable), `gr' (argument is in general register), `fr' (in
     floating point register), or `fu' (upper half of float register).
     For `priv_lev', R is an integer.

`.half N'
     Define a two-byte integer constant N; synonym for the portable
     `as' directive `.short'.

`.import NAME [ ,TYP ]'
     Converse of `.export'; make a procedure available to call.  The
     arguments use the same conventions as the first two arguments for
     `.export'.

`.label NAME'
     Define NAME as a label for the current assembly location.

`.leave'
     Not yet supported; the assembler rejects programs containing this
     directive.

`.origin LC'
     Advance location counter to LC. Synonym for the `{No Value For
     "as"}' portable directive `.org'.

`.param NAME [ ,TYP ]  [ ,PARAM=R ]'
     Similar to `.export', but used for static procedures.

`.proc'
     Use preceding the first statement of a procedure.

`.procend'
     Use following the last statement of a procedure.

`LABEL .reg EXPR'
     Synonym for `.equ'; define LABEL with the absolute expression EXPR
     as its value.

`.space SECNAME [ ,PARAMS ]'
     Switch to section SECNAME, creating a new section by that name if
     necessary.  You may only use PARAMS when creating a new section,
     not when switching to an existing one.  SECNAME may identify a
     section by number rather than by name.

     If specified, the list PARAMS declares attributes of the section,
     identified by keywords.  The keywords recognized are `spnum=EXP'
     (identify this section by the number EXP, an absolute expression),
     `sort=EXP' (order sections according to this sort key when linking;
     EXP is an absolute expression), `unloadable' (section contains no
     loadable data), `notdefined' (this section defined elsewhere), and
     `private' (data in this section not available to other programs).

`.spnum SECNAM'
     Allocate four bytes of storage, and initialize them with the
     section number of the section named SECNAM.  (You can define the
     section number with the HPPA `.space' directive.)

`.string "STR"'
     Copy the characters in the string STR to the object file.  *Note
     Strings: Strings, for information on escape sequences you can use
     in `as' strings.

     *Warning!* The HPPA version of `.string' differs from the usual
     `as' definition: it does *not* write a zero byte after copying STR.

`.stringz "STR"'
     Like `.string', but appends a zero byte after copying STR to object
     file.

`.subspa NAME [ ,PARAMS ]'
`.nsubspa NAME [ ,PARAMS ]'
     Similar to `.space', but selects a subsection NAME within the
     current section.  You may only specify PARAMS when you create a
     subsection (in the first instance of `.subspa' for this NAME).

     If specified, the list PARAMS declares attributes of the
     subsection, identified by keywords.  The keywords recognized are
     `quad=EXPR' ("quadrant" for this subsection), `align=EXPR'
     (alignment for beginning of this subsection; a power of two),
     `access=EXPR' (value for "access rights" field), `sort=EXPR'
     (sorting order for this subspace in link), `code_only' (subsection
     contains only code), `unloadable' (subsection cannot be loaded
     into memory), `common' (subsection is common block), `dup_comm'
     (initialized data may have duplicate names), or `zero' (subsection
     is all zeros, do not write in object file).

     `.nsubspa' always creates a new subspace with the given name, even
     if one with the same name already exists.

`.version "STR"'
     Write STR as version identifier in object code.

Special Characters
..................

   `!' is the line comment character.

   You can use `;' instead of a newline to separate statements.

   Since `$' has no special meaning, you may use it in symbol names.


File: as.info,  Node: SH-Regs,  Next: SH-Addressing,  Prev: SH-Chars,  Up: SH Syntax

Register Names
..............

   You can use the predefined symbols `r0', `r1', `r2', `r3', `r4',
`r5', `r6', `r7', `r8', `r9', `r10', `r11', `r12', `r13', `r14', and
`r15' to refer to the SH registers.

   The SH also has these control registers:

`pr'
     procedure register (holds return address)

`pc'
     program counter

`mach'
`macl'
     high and low multiply accumulator registers

`sr'
     status register

`gbr'
     global base register

`vbr'
     vector base register (for interrupt vectors)


File: as.info,  Node: SH-Addressing,  Prev: SH-Regs,  Up: SH Syntax

Addressing Modes
................

   `as' understands the following addressing modes for the SH.  `RN' in
the following refers to any of the numbered registers, but *not* the
control registers.

`RN'
     Register direct

`@@RN'
     Register indirect

`@@-RN'
     Register indirect with pre-decrement

`@@RN+'
     Register indirect with post-increment

`@@(DISP, RN)'
     Register indirect with displacement

`@@(R0, RN)'
     Register indexed

`@@(DISP, GBR)'
     `GBR' offset

`@@(R0, GBR)'
     GBR indexed

`ADDR'
`@@(DISP, PC)'
     PC relative address (for branch or for addressing memory).  The
     `as' implementation allows you to use the simpler form ADDR
     anywhere a PC relative address is called for; the alternate form
     is supported for compatibility with other assemblers.

`#IMM'
     Immediate data


File: as.info,  Node: SH Floating Point,  Next: SH Directives,  Prev: SH Syntax,  Up: SH-Dependent

Floating Point
--------------

   The SH family has no hardware floating point, but the `.float'
directive generates IEEE floating-point numbers for compatibility with
other development tools.

SH Machine Directives
---------------------

   `as' has no machine-dependent directives for the SH.

Opcodes
-------

   For detailed information on the SH machine instruction set, see
`SH-Microcomputer User's Manual' (Hitachi Micro Systems, Inc.).

   `as' implements all the standard SH opcodes.  No additional
pseudo-instructions are needed on this family.  Note, however, that
because `as' supports a simpler form of PC-relative addressing, you may
simply write (for example)

     mov.l  bar,r0

where other assemblers might require an explicit displacement to `bar'
from the program counter:

     mov.l  @@(DISP, PC)

File: as.info,  Node: Options-i960,  Next: Floating Point-i960,  Up: i960-Dependent

i960 Command-line Options
-------------------------

`-ACA | -ACA_A | -ACB | -ACC | -AKA | -AKB | -AKC | -AMC'
     Select the 80960 architecture.  Instructions or features not
     supported by the selected architecture cause fatal errors.

     `-ACA' is equivalent to `-ACA_A'; `-AKC' is equivalent to `-AMC'.
     Synonyms are provided for compatibility with other tools.

     If you do not specify any of these options, `as' generates code
     for any instruction or feature that is supported by *some* version
     of the 960 (even if this means mixing architectures!).  In
     principle, `as' attempts to deduce the minimal sufficient
     processor type if none is specified; depending on the object code
     format, the processor type may be recorded in the object file.  If
     it is critical that the `as' output match a specific architecture,
     specify that architecture explicitly.

`-b'
     Add code to collect information about conditional branches taken,
     for later optimization using branch prediction bits.  (The
     conditional branch instructions have branch prediction bits in the
     CA, CB, and CC architectures.)  If BR represents a conditional
     branch instruction, the following represents the code generated by
     the assembler when `-b' is specified:

                  call    INCREMENT ROUTINE
                  .word   0       # pre-counter
          Label:  BR
                  call    INCREMENT ROUTINE
                  .word   0       # post-counter

     The counter following a branch records the number of times that
     branch was *not* taken; the differenc between the two counters is
     the number of times the branch *was* taken.

     A table of every such `Label' is also generated, so that the
     external postprocessor `gbr960' (supplied by Intel) can locate all
     the counters.  This table is always labelled `__BRANCH_TABLE__';
     this is a local symbol to permit collecting statistics for many
     separate object files.  The table is word aligned, and begins with
     a two-word header.  The first word, initialized to 0, is used in
     maintaining linked lists of branch tables.  The second word is a
     count of the number of entries in the table, which follow
     immediately: each is a word, pointing to one of the labels
     illustrated above.

                         __BRANCH_TABLE__ layout

     The first word of the header is used to locate multiple branch
     tables, since each object file may contain one. Normally the links
     are maintained with a call to an initialization routine, placed at
     the beginning of each function in the file.  The GNU C compiler
     generates these calls automatically when you give it a `-b' option.
     For further details, see the documentation of `gbr960'.

`-no-relax'
     Normally, Compare-and-Branch instructions with targets that require
     displacements greater than 13 bits (or that have external targets)
     are replaced with the corresponding compare (or `chkbit') and
     branch instructions.  You can use the `-no-relax' option to
     specify that `as' should generate errors instead, if the target
     displacement is larger than 13 bits.

     This option does not affect the Compare-and-Jump instructions; the
     code emitted for them is *always* adjusted when necessary
     (depending on displacement size), regardless of whether you use
     `-no-relax'.

i960 Machine Directives
-----------------------

`.bss SYMBOL, LENGTH, ALIGN'
     Reserve LENGTH bytes in the bss section for a local SYMBOL,
     aligned to the power of two specified by ALIGN.  LENGTH and ALIGN
     must be positive absolute expressions.  This directive differs
     from `.lcomm' only in that it permits you to specify an alignment.
     *Note `.lcomm': Lcomm.

`.extended FLONUMS'
     `.extended' expects zero or more flonums, separated by commas; for
     each flonum, `.extended' emits an IEEE extended-format (80-bit)
     floating-point number.

`.leafproc CALL-LAB, BAL-LAB'
     You can use the `.leafproc' directive in conjunction with the
     optimized `callj' instruction to enable faster calls of leaf
     procedures.  If a procedure is known to call no other procedures,
     you may define an entry point that skips procedure prolog code
     (and that does not depend on system-supplied saved context), and
     declare it as the BAL-LAB using `.leafproc'.  If the procedure
     also has an entry point that goes through the normal prolog, you
     can specify that entry point as CALL-LAB.

     A `.leafproc' declaration is meant for use in conjunction with the
     optimized call instruction `callj'; the directive records the data
     needed later to choose between converting the `callj' into a `bal'
     or a `call'.

     CALL-LAB is optional; if only one argument is present, or if the
     two arguments are identical, the single argument is assumed to be
     the `bal' entry point.

`.sysproc NAME, INDEX'
     The `.sysproc' directive defines a name for a system procedure.
     After you define it using `.sysproc', you can use NAME to refer to
     the system procedure identified by INDEX when calling procedures
     with the optimized call instruction `callj'.

     Both arguments are required; INDEX must be between 0 and 31
     (inclusive).

instruction subset for a particular 960 architecture.

   Some opcodes are processed beyond simply emitting a single

bits.

`callj'
.......

   You can write `callj' to have the assembler or the linker determine
the most appropriate form of subroutine call: `call', `bal', or
`calls'.  If the assembly source contains enough information--a
`.leafproc' or `.sysproc' directive defining the operand--then `as'
translates the `callj'; if not, it simply emits the `callj', leaving it
for the linker to resolve.


File: as.info,  Node: Compare-and-branch-i960,  Prev: callj-i960,  Up: Opcodes for i960

Compare-and-Branch
..................

   The 960 architectures provide combined Compare-and-Branch
instructions that permit you to store the branch target in the lower 13
bits of the instruction word itself.  However, if you specify a branch
target far enough away that its address won't fit in 13 bits, the
assembler can either issue an error, or convert your Compare-and-Branch
instruction into separate instructions to do the compare and the branch.

   Whether `as' gives an error or expands the instruction depends on
two choices you can make: whether you use the `-no-relax' option, and
whether you use a "Compare and Branch" instruction or a "Compare and
Jump" instruction.  The "Jump" instructions are *always* expanded if
necessary; the "Branch" instructions are expanded when necessary
*unless* you specify `-no-relax'--in which case `as' gives an error
instead.

   These are the Compare-and-Branch instructions, their "Jump" variants,
and the instruction pairs they may expand into:

             Compare and
          Branch      Jump       Expanded to

M680x0 Options
--------------

   The Motorola 680x0 version of `as' has a few machine dependent
options.

   You can use the `-l' option to shorten the size of references to
undefined symbols.  If you do not use the `-l' option, references to
undefined symbols are wide enough for a full `long' (32 bits).  (Since
`as' cannot know where these symbols end up, `as' can only allocate
space for the linker to fill in later.  Since `as' does not know how
far away these symbols are, it allocates as much space as it can.)  If
you use this option, the references are only one word wide (16 bits).
This may be useful if you want the object file to be as small as
possible, and you know that the relevant symbols are always less than
17 bits away.

   For some configurations, especially those where the compiler normally
does not prepend an underscore to the names of user variables, the
assembler requires a `%' before any use of a register name.  This is
intended to let the assembler distinguish between C variables and
functions named `a0' through `a7', and so on.  The `%' is always
accepted, but is not required for certain configurations, notably
`sun3'.  The `--register-prefix-optional' option may be used to permit
omitting the `%' even for configurations for which it is normally
required.  If this is done, it will generally be impossible to refer to
C variables and functions with the same names as register names.

   `as' can assemble code for several different members of the Motorola
680x0 family.  The default depends upon how `as' was configured when it
was built; normally, the default is to assemble code for the 68020
microprocessor.  The following options may be used to change the
default.  These options control which instructions and addressing modes
are permitted.  The members of the 680x0 family are very similar.  For
detailed information about the differences, see the Motorola manuals.

`-m68000'
`-m68008'
`-m68302'
     Assemble for the 68000.  `-m68008' and `-m68302' are synonyms for
     `-m68000', since the chips are the same from the point of view of
     the assembler.

`-m68010'
     Assemble for the 68010.

`-m68020'
     Assemble for the 68020.  This is normally the default.

`-m68030'
     Assemble for the 68030.

`-m68040'
     Assemble for the 68040.

`-m68060'
     Assemble for the 68060.

`-mcpu32'
`-m68331'
`-m68332'
`-m68333'
`-m68340'
`-m68360'
     Assemble for the CPU32 family of chips.

`-m68881'
`-m68882'
     Assemble 68881 floating point instructions.  This is the default
     for the 68020, 68030, and the CPU32.  The 68040 and 68060 always
     support floating point instructions.

`-mno-68881'
     Do not assemble 68881 floating point instructions.  This is the
     default for 68000 and the 68010.  The 68040 and 68060 always
     support floating point instructions, even if this option is used.

`-m68851'
     Assemble 68851 MMU instructions.  This is the default for the
     68020, 68030, and 68060.  The 68040 accepts a somewhat different
     set of MMU instructions; `-m68851' and `-m68040' should not be used
     together.

`-mno-68851'
     Do not assemble 68851 MMU instructions.  This is the default for
     the 68000, 68010, and the CPU32.  The 68040 accepts a somewhat
     different set of MMU instructions.

Syntax
------

   This syntax for the Motorola 680x0 was developed at MIT.

   The 680x0 version of `as' uses instructions names and syntax
compatible with the Sun assembler.  Intervening periods are ignored;
for example, `movl' is equivalent to `mov.l'.

   In the following table APC stands for any of the address registers
(`%a0' through `%a7'), the program counter (`%pc'), the zero-address
relative to the program counter (`%zpc'), a suppressed address register
(`%za0' through `%za7'), or it may be omitted entirely.  The use of
SIZE means one of `w' or `l', and it may be omitted, along with the
leading colon, unless a scale is also specified.  The use of SCALE
means one of `1', `2', `4', or `8', and it may always be omitted along
with the leading colon.

   The following addressing modes are understood:
"Immediate"
     `#NUMBER'

"Data Register"
     `%d0' through `%d7'

"Address Register"
     `%a0' through `%a7'
     `%a7' is also known as `%sp', i.e. the Stack Pointer.  `%a6' is
     also known as `%fp', the Frame Pointer.

"Address Register Indirect"
     `%a0@@' through `%a7@@'

"Address Register Postincrement"
     `%a0@@+' through `%a7@@+'

"Address Register Predecrement"
     `%a0@@-' through `%a7@@-'

"Indirect Plus Offset"
     `APC@@(NUMBER)'

"Index"
     `APC@@(NUMBER,REGISTER:SIZE:SCALE)'

     The NUMBER may be omitted.

"Postindex"
     `APC@@(NUMBER)@@(ONUMBER,REGISTER:SIZE:SCALE)'

     The ONUMBER or the REGISTER, but not both, may be omitted.

"Preindex"
     `APC@@(NUMBER,REGISTER:SIZE:SCALE)@@(ONUMBER)'

     The NUMBER may be omitted.  Omitting the REGISTER produces the
     Postindex addressing mode.

"Absolute"
     `SYMBOL', or `DIGITS', optionally followed by `:b', `:w', or `:l'.

Motorola Syntax
---------------

   The standard Motorola syntax for this chip differs from the syntax
already discussed (*note Syntax: M68K-Syntax.).  `as' can accept
Motorola syntax for operands, even if MIT syntax is used for other
operands in the same instruction.  The two kinds of syntax are fully
compatible.

   In the following table APC stands for any of the address registers
(`%a0' through `%a7'), the program counter (`%pc'), the zero-address
relative to the program counter (`%zpc'), or a suppressed address
register (`%za0' through `%za7').  The use of SIZE means one of `w' or
`l', and it may always be omitted along with the leading dot.  The use
of SCALE means one of `1', `2', `4', or `8', and it may always be
omitted along with the leading asterisk.

   The following additional addressing modes are understood:

"Address Register Indirect"
     `(%a0)' through `(%a7)'
     `%a7' is also known as `%sp', i.e. the Stack Pointer.  `%a6' is
     also known as `%fp', the Frame Pointer.

"Address Register Postincrement"
     `(%a0)+' through `(%a7)+'

"Address Register Predecrement"
     `-(%a0)' through `-(%a7)'

"Indirect Plus Offset"
     `NUMBER(%A0)' through `NUMBER(%A7)', or `NUMBER(%PC)'.

     The NUMBER may also appear within the parentheses, as in
     `(NUMBER,%A0)'.  When used with the PC, the NUMBER may be omitted
     (with an address register, omitting the NUMBER produces Address
     Register Indirect mode).

"Index"
     `NUMBER(APC,REGISTER.SIZE*SCALE)'

     The NUMBER may be omitted, or it may appear within the
     parentheses.  The APC may be omitted.  The REGISTER and the APC
     may appear in either order.  If both APC and REGISTER are address
     registers, and the SIZE and SCALE are omitted, then the first
     register is taken as the base register, and the second as the
     index register.

"Postindex"
     `([NUMBER,APC],REGISTER.SIZE*SCALE,ONUMBER)'

     The ONUMBER, or the REGISTER, or both, may be omitted.  Either the
     NUMBER or the APC may be omitted, but not both.

"Preindex"
     `([NUMBER,APC,REGISTER.SIZE*SCALE],ONUMBER)'

     The NUMBER, or the APC, or the REGISTER, or any two of them, may
     be omitted.  The ONUMBER may be omitted.  The REGISTER and the APC
     may appear in either order.  If both APC and REGISTER are address
     registers, and the SIZE and SCALE are omitted, then the first
     register is taken as the base register, and the second as the
     index register.

Floating Point
--------------

   Packed decimal (P) format floating literals are not supported.  Feel
free to add the code!

   The floating point formats generated by directives are these.

`.float'
     `Single' precision floating point constants.

`.double'
     `Double' precision floating point constants.

   There is no directive to produce regions of memory holding extended
precision numbers, however they can be used as immediate operands to
floating-point instructions.  Adding a directive to create extended
precision numbers would not be hard, but it has not yet seemed
necessary.

680x0 Machine Directives
------------------------

   In order to be compatible with the Sun assembler the 680x0 assembler
understands the following directives.

`.data1'
     This directive is identical to a `.data 1' directive.

`.data2'
     This directive is identical to a `.data 2' directive.

`.even'
     This directive is a special case of the `.align' directive; it
     aligns the output to an even byte boundary.

`.skip'
     This directive is identical to a `.space' directive.

Branch Improvement
..................

   Certain pseudo opcodes are permitted for branch instructions.  They
expand to the shortest branch instruction that reach the target.
Generally these mnemonics are made by substituting `j' for `b' at the
start of a Motorola mnemonic.

   The following table summarizes the pseudo-operations.  A `*' flags
cases that are more fully described after the table:

               Displacement
               +-------------------------------------------------
               |                68020   68000/10

               +-------------------------------------------------

     *     jXX |bXXs    bXX     bXXl    bNXs;jmpl bNXs;jmp
     *    dbXX |dbXX    dbXX        dbXX; bra; jmpl
     *    fjXX |fbXXw   fbXXw   fbXXl             fbNXw;jmp
     
     XX: condition
     NX: negative of condition XX

                    `*'--see full description below

`jbsr'
`jra'
     These are the simplest jump pseudo-operations; they always map to
     one particular machine instruction, depending on the displacement
     to the branch target.

`jXX'
     Here, `jXX' stands for an entire family of pseudo-operations,
     where XX is a conditional branch or condition-code test.  The full
     list of pseudo-ops in this family is:
           jhi   jls   jcc   jcs   jne   jeq   jvc
           jvs   jpl   jmi   jge   jlt   jgt   jle

     For the cases of non-PC relative displacements and long
     displacements on the 68000 or 68010, `as' issues a longer code
     fragment in terms of NX, the opposite condition to XX.  For
     example, for the non-PC relative case:
              jXX foo
     gives
               bNXs oof
               jmp foo
           oof:

`dbXX'
     The full family of pseudo-operations covered here is
           dbhi   dbls   dbcc   dbcs   dbne   dbeq   dbvc
           dbvs   dbpl   dbmi   dbge   dblt   dbgt   dble
           dbf    dbra   dbt

     Other than for word and byte displacements, when the source reads
     `dbXX foo', `as' emits
               dbXX oo1
               bra oo2
           oo1:jmpl foo
           oo2:

`fjXX'
     This family includes
           fjne   fjeq   fjge   fjlt   fjgt   fjle   fjf
           fjt    fjgl   fjgle  fjnge  fjngl  fjngle fjngt

           fjor   fjseq  fjsf   fjsne  fjst   fjueq  fjuge
           fjugt  fjule  fjult  fjun

     For branch targets that are not PC relative, `as' emits
               fbNX oof
               jmp foo
           oof:
     when it encounters `fjXX foo'.

Options
-------

   The SPARC chip family includes several successive levels (or other
variants) of chip, using the same core instruction set, but including a
few additional instructions at each level.

   By default, `as' assumes the core instruction set (SPARC v6), but
"bumps" the architecture level as needed: it switches to successively
higher architectures as it encounters instructions that only exist in
the higher levels.

`-Av6 | -Av7 | -Av8 | -Av9 | -Asparclite'
     Use one of the `-A' options to select one of the SPARC
     architectures explicitly.  If you select an architecture
     explicitly, `as' reports a fatal error if it encounters an
     instruction or feature requiring a higher level.

`-bump'
     Permit the assembler to "bump" the architecture level as required,
     but warn whenever it is necessary to switch to another level.

Sparc Machine Directives
------------------------

   The Sparc version of `as' supports the following additional machine
directives:

`.align'
     This must be followed by the desired alignment in bytes.

`.common'
     This must be followed by a symbol name, a positive number, and
     `"bss"'.  This behaves somewhat like `.comm', but the syntax is
     different.

`.half'
     This is functionally identical to `.short'.

`.proc'
     This directive is ignored.  Any text following it on the same line
     is also ignored.

`.reserve'
     This must be followed by a symbol name, a positive number, and
     `"bss"'.  This behaves somewhat like `.lcomm', but the syntax is
     different.

`.seg'
     This must be followed by `"text"', `"data"', or `"data1"'.  It
     behaves like `.text', `.data', or `.data 1'.

`.skip'
     This is functionally identical to the `.space' directive.

`.word'
     On the Sparc, the `.word' directive produces 32 bit values,
     instead of the 16 bit values it produces on many other machines.

`.xword'
     On the Sparc V9 processor, the `.xword' directive produces 64 bit
     values.

AT&T Syntax versus Intel Syntax
-------------------------------

   In order to maintain compatibility with the output of `gcc', `as'
supports AT&T System V/386 assembler syntax.  This is quite different
from Intel syntax.  We mention these differences because almost all
80386 documents used only Intel syntax.  Notable differences between
the two syntaxes are:

   * AT&T immediate operands are preceded by `$'; Intel immediate
     operands are undelimited (Intel `push 4' is AT&T `pushl $4').
     AT&T register operands are preceded by `%'; Intel register operands
     are undelimited.  AT&T absolute (as opposed to PC relative)
     jump/call operands are prefixed by `*'; they are undelimited in
     Intel syntax.

   * AT&T and Intel syntax use the opposite order for source and
     destination operands.  Intel `add eax, 4' is `addl $4, %eax'.  The
     `source, dest' convention is maintained for compatibility with
     previous Unix assemblers.

   * In AT&T syntax the size of memory operands is determined from the
     last character of the opcode name.  Opcode suffixes of `b', `w',
     and `l' specify byte (8-bit), word (16-bit), and long (32-bit)
     memory references.  Intel syntax accomplishes this by prefixes
     memory operands (*not* the opcodes themselves) with `byte ptr',
     `word ptr', and `dword ptr'.  Thus, Intel `mov al, byte ptr FOO'
     is `movb FOO, %al' in AT&T syntax.

   * Immediate form long jumps and calls are `lcall/ljmp $SECTION,
     $OFFSET' in AT&T syntax; the Intel syntax is `call/jmp far
     SECTION:OFFSET'.  Also, the far return instruction is `lret
     $STACK-ADJUST' in AT&T syntax; Intel syntax is `ret far
     STACK-ADJUST'.

   * The AT&T assembler does not provide support for multiple section
     programs.  Unix style systems expect all programs to be single
     sections.

Opcode Naming
-------------

   Opcode names are suffixed with one character modifiers which specify
the size of operands.  The letters `b', `w', and `l' specify byte,
word, and long operands.  If no suffix is specified by an instruction
and it contains no memory operands then `as' tries to fill in the
missing suffix based on the destination register operand (the last one
by convention).  Thus, `mov %ax, %bx' is equivalent to `movw %ax, %bx';
also, `mov $1, %bx' is equivalent to `movw $1, %bx'.  Note that this is
incompatible with the AT&T Unix assembler which assumes that a missing
opcode suffix implies long operand size.  (This incompatibility does
not affect compiler output since compilers always explicitly specify
the opcode suffix.)

   Almost all opcodes have the same names in AT&T and Intel format.
There are a few exceptions.  The sign extend and zero extend
instructions need two sizes to specify them.  They need a size to
sign/zero extend *from* and a size to zero extend *to*.  This is
accomplished by using two opcode suffixes in AT&T syntax.  Base names
for sign extend and zero extend are `movs...' and `movz...' in AT&T
syntax (`movsx' and `movzx' in Intel syntax).  The opcode suffixes are
tacked on to this base name, the *from* suffix before the *to* suffix.
Thus, `movsbl %al, %edx' is AT&T syntax for "move sign extend *from*
%al *to* %edx."  Possible suffixes, thus, are `bl' (from byte to long),
`bw' (from byte to word), and `wl' (from word to long).

   The Intel-syntax conversion instructions

   * `cbw' -- sign-extend byte in `%al' to word in `%ax',

   * `cwde' -- sign-extend word in `%ax' to long in `%eax',

   * `cwd' -- sign-extend word in `%ax' to long in `%dx:%ax',

   * `cdq' -- sign-extend dword in `%eax' to quad in `%edx:%eax',

are called `cbtw', `cwtl', `cwtd', and `cltd' in AT&T naming.  `as'
accepts either naming for these instructions.

   Far call/jump instructions are `lcall' and `ljmp' in AT&T syntax,
but are `call far' and `jump far' in Intel convention.

Register Naming
---------------

   Register operands are always prefixes with `%'.  The 80386 registers
consist of

   * the 8 32-bit registers `%eax' (the accumulator), `%ebx', `%ecx',
     `%edx', `%edi', `%esi', `%ebp' (the frame pointer), and `%esp'
     (the stack pointer).

   * the 8 16-bit low-ends of these: `%ax', `%bx', `%cx', `%dx', `%di',
     `%si', `%bp', and `%sp'.

   * the 8 8-bit registers: `%ah', `%al', `%bh', `%bl', `%ch', `%cl',
     `%dh', and `%dl' (These are the high-bytes and low-bytes of `%ax',
     `%bx', `%cx', and `%dx')

   * the 6 section registers `%cs' (code section), `%ds' (data
     section), `%ss' (stack section), `%es', `%fs', and `%gs'.

   * the 3 processor control registers `%cr0', `%cr2', and `%cr3'.

   * the 6 debug registers `%db0', `%db1', `%db2', `%db3', `%db6', and
     `%db7'.

   * the 2 test registers `%tr6' and `%tr7'.

   * the 8 floating point register stack `%st' or equivalently
     `%st(0)', `%st(1)', `%st(2)', `%st(3)', `%st(4)', `%st(5)',
     `%st(6)', and `%st(7)'.

Opcode Prefixes
---------------

   Opcode prefixes are used to modify the following opcode.  They are
used to repeat string instructions, to provide section overrides, to
perform bus lock operations, and to give operand and address size
(16-bit operands are specified in an instruction by prefixing what would
normally be 32-bit operands with a "operand size" opcode prefix).
Opcode prefixes are usually given as single-line instructions with no
operands, and must directly precede the instruction they act upon.  For
example, the `scas' (scan string) instruction is repeated with:
             repne
             scas

   Here is a list of opcode prefixes:

   * Section override prefixes `cs', `ds', `ss', `es', `fs', `gs'.
     These are automatically added by specifying using the
     SECTION:MEMORY-OPERAND form for memory references.

   * Operand/Address size prefixes `data16' and `addr16' change 32-bit
     operands/addresses into 16-bit operands/addresses.  Note that
     16-bit addressing modes (i.e. 8086 and 80286 addressing modes) are
     not supported (yet).

   * The bus lock prefix `lock' inhibits interrupts during execution of
     the instruction it precedes.  (This is only valid with certain
     instructions; see a 80386 manual for details).

   * The wait for coprocessor prefix `wait' waits for the coprocessor
     to complete the current instruction.  This should never be needed
     for the 80386/80387 combination.

   * The `rep', `repe', and `repne' prefixes are added to string
     instructions to make them repeat `%ecx' times.

Memory References
-----------------

   An Intel syntax indirect memory reference of the form

     SECTION:[BASE + INDEX*SCALE + DISP]

is translated into the AT&T syntax

     SECTION:DISP(BASE, INDEX, SCALE)

where BASE and INDEX are the optional 32-bit base and index registers,
DISP is the optional displacement, and SCALE, taking the values 1, 2,
4, and 8, multiplies INDEX to calculate the address of the operand.  If
no SCALE is specified, SCALE is taken to be 1.  SECTION specifies the
optional section register for the memory operand, and may override the
default section register (see a 80386 manual for section register
defaults). Note that section overrides in AT&T syntax *must* have be
preceded by a `%'.  If you specify a section override which coincides
with the default section register, `as' does *not* output any section
register override prefixes to assemble the given instruction.  Thus,
section overrides can be specified to emphasize which section register
is used for a given memory operand.

   Here are some examples of Intel and AT&T style memory references:

AT&T: `-4(%ebp)', Intel:  `[ebp - 4]'
     BASE is `%ebp'; DISP is `-4'. SECTION is missing, and the default
     section is used (`%ss' for addressing with `%ebp' as the base
     register).  INDEX, SCALE are both missing.

AT&T: `foo(,%eax,4)', Intel: `[foo + eax*4]'
     INDEX is `%eax' (scaled by a SCALE 4); DISP is `foo'.  All other
     fields are missing.  The section register here defaults to `%ds'.

AT&T: `foo(,1)'; Intel `[foo]'
     This uses the value pointed to by `foo' as a memory operand.  Note
     that BASE and INDEX are both missing, but there is only *one* `,'.
     This is a syntactic exception.

AT&T: `%gs:foo'; Intel `gs:foo'
     This selects the contents of the variable `foo' with section
     register SECTION being `%gs'.

   Absolute (as opposed to PC relative) call and jump operands must be
prefixed with `*'.  If no `*' is specified, `as' always chooses PC
relative addressing for jump/call labels.

   Any instruction that has a memory operand *must* specify its size
(byte, word, or long) with an opcode suffix (`b', `w', or `l',
respectively).

Notes
-----

   As a back end for GNU CC `as' has been throughly tested and should
work extremely well.  We have tested it only minimally on hand written
assembly code and no one has tested it much on the assembly output from
the HP compilers.

   The format of the debugging sections has changed since the original
`as' port (version 1.3X) was released; therefore, you must rebuild all
HPPA objects and libraries with the new assembler so that you can debug
the final executable.

   The HPPA `as' port generates a small subset of the relocations
available in the SOM and ELF object file formats.  Additional relocation
support will be added as it becomes necessary.

Options
-------

   `as' has no machine-dependent command-line options for the HPPA.


File: as.info,  Node: HPPA Syntax,  Next: HPPA Floating Point,  Prev: HPPA Options,  Up: HPPA-Dependent

Syntax
------

   The assembler syntax closely follows the HPPA instruction set
reference manual; assembler directives and general syntax closely
follow the HPPA assembly language reference manual, with a few
noteworthy differences.

   First, a colon may immediately follow a label definition.  This is
simply for compatibility with how most assembly language programmers
write code.

   Some obscure expression parsing problems may affect hand written
code which uses the `spop' instructions, or code which makes significant
use of the `!' line separator.

   `as' is much less forgiving about missing arguments and other
similar oversights than the HP assembler.  `as' notifies you of missing
arguments as syntax errors; this is regarded as a feature, not a bug.

   Finally, `as' allows you to use an external symbol without
explicitly importing the symbol.  *Warning:* in the future this will be
an error for HPPA targets.

   Special characters for HPPA targets include:

   `;' is the line comment character.

   `!' can be used instead of a newline to separate statements.

   Since `$' has no special meaning, you may use it in symbol names.

AT&T Syntax versus Intel Syntax
-------------------------------
d240 3
a242 5
   In order to maintain compatibility with the output of `gcc', `as'
supports AT&T System V/386 assembler syntax.  This is quite different
from Intel syntax.  We mention these differences because almost all
80386 documents used only Intel syntax.  Notable differences between
the two syntaxes are:
d244 2
a245 6
   * AT&T immediate operands are preceded by `$'; Intel immediate
     operands are undelimited (Intel `push 4' is AT&T `pushl $4').
     AT&T register operands are preceded by `%'; Intel register operands
     are undelimited.  AT&T absolute (as opposed to PC relative)
     jump/call operands are prefixed by `*'; they are undelimited in
     Intel syntax.
d247 2
a248 4
   * AT&T and Intel syntax use the opposite order for source and
     destination operands.  Intel `add eax, 4' is `addl $4, %eax'.  The
     `source, dest' convention is maintained for compatibility with
     previous Unix assemblers.
d250 1
a250 7
   * In AT&T syntax the size of memory operands is determined from the
     last character of the opcode name.  Opcode suffixes of `b', `w',
     and `l' specify byte (8-bit), word (16-bit), and long (32-bit)
     memory references.  Intel syntax accomplishes this by prefixes
     memory operands (*not* the opcodes themselves) with `byte ptr',
     `word ptr', and `dword ptr'.  Thus, Intel `mov al, byte ptr FOO'
     is `movb FOO, %al' in AT&T syntax.
d252 1
a252 5
   * Immediate form long jumps and calls are `lcall/ljmp $SECTION,
     $OFFSET' in AT&T syntax; the Intel syntax is `call/jmp far
     SECTION:OFFSET'.  Also, the far return instruction is `lret
     $STACK-ADJUST' in AT&T syntax; Intel syntax is `ret far
     STACK-ADJUST'.
d254 1
a254 3
   * The AT&T assembler does not provide support for multiple section
     programs.  Unix style systems expect all programs to be single
     sections.

Opcode Naming
-------------
d259 2
a260 11
   Opcode names are suffixed with one character modifiers which specify
the size of operands.  The letters `b', `w', and `l' specify byte,
word, and long operands.  If no suffix is specified by an instruction
and it contains no memory operands then `as' tries to fill in the
missing suffix based on the destination register operand (the last one
by convention).  Thus, `mov %ax, %bx' is equivalent to `movw %ax, %bx';
also, `mov $1, %bx' is equivalent to `movw $1, %bx'.  Note that this is
incompatible with the AT&T Unix assembler which assumes that a missing
opcode suffix implies long operand size.  (This incompatibility does
not affect compiler output since compilers always explicitly specify
the opcode suffix.)
d262 3
a264 11
   Almost all opcodes have the same names in AT&T and Intel format.
There are a few exceptions.  The sign extend and zero extend
instructions need two sizes to specify them.  They need a size to
sign/zero extend *from* and a size to zero extend *to*.  This is
accomplished by using two opcode suffixes in AT&T syntax.  Base names
for sign extend and zero extend are `movs...' and `movz...' in AT&T
syntax (`movsx' and `movzx' in Intel syntax).  The opcode suffixes are
tacked on to this base name, the *from* suffix before the *to* suffix.
Thus, `movsbl %al, %edx' is AT&T syntax for "move sign extend *from*
%al *to* %edx."  Possible suffixes, thus, are `bl' (from byte to long),
`bw' (from byte to word), and `wl' (from word to long).

d281 2
a282 2
are called `cbtw', `cwtl', `cwtd', and `cltd' in AT&T naming.  `as'
accepts either naming for these instructions.
d284 2
a285 2
   Far call/jump instructions are `lcall' and `ljmp' in AT&T syntax,
but are `call far' and `jump far' in Intel convention.

   Register operands are always prefixes with `%'.  The 80386 registers
consist of
d293 3
a295 3
   * the 8 32-bit registers `%eax' (the accumulator), `%ebx', `%ecx',
     `%edx', `%edi', `%esi', `%ebp' (the frame pointer), and `%esp'
     (the stack pointer).
d297 2
a298 2
   * the 8 16-bit low-ends of these: `%ax', `%bx', `%cx', `%dx', `%di',
     `%si', `%bp', and `%sp'.
d300 2
a301 3
   * the 8 8-bit registers: `%ah', `%al', `%bh', `%bl', `%ch', `%cl',
     `%dh', and `%dl' (These are the high-bytes and low-bytes of `%ax',
     `%bx', `%cx', and `%dx')
d303 2

Opcode Prefixes
---------------
d328 2
a329 10
   Opcode prefixes are used to modify the following opcode.  They are
used to repeat string instructions, to provide section overrides, to
perform bus lock operations, and to give operand and address size
(16-bit operands are specified in an instruction by prefixing what would
normally be 32-bit operands with a "operand size" opcode prefix).
Opcode prefixes are usually given as single-line instructions with no
operands, and must directly precede the instruction they act upon.  For
example, the `scas' (scan string) instruction is repeated with:
             repne
             scas
d331 2
a332 1
   Here is a list of opcode prefixes:
d334 2
a335 3
   * Section override prefixes `cs', `ds', `ss', `es', `fs', `gs'.
     These are automatically added by specifying using the
     SECTION:MEMORY-OPERAND form for memory references.
d337 3
a339 4
   * Operand/Address size prefixes `data16' and `addr16' change 32-bit
     operands/addresses into 16-bit operands/addresses.  Note that
     16-bit addressing modes (i.e. 8086 and 80286 addressing modes) are
     not supported (yet).
d341 2
a342 3
   * The bus lock prefix `lock' inhibits interrupts during execution of
     the instruction it precedes.  (This is only valid with certain
     instructions; see a 80386 manual for details).
d344 2
a345 3
   * The wait for coprocessor prefix `wait' waits for the coprocessor
     to complete the current instruction.  This should never be needed
     for the 80386/80387 combination.
d347 1
a347 2
   * The `rep', `repe', and `repne' prefixes are added to string
     instructions to make them repeat `%ecx' times.

Memory References
-----------------
d355 2
a356 1
   An Intel syntax indirect memory reference of the form
d358 4
a361 1
     SECTION:[BASE + INDEX*SCALE + DISP]
d363 1
a363 1
is translated into the AT&T syntax
d365 2
a366 1
     SECTION:DISP(BASE, INDEX, SCALE)
d368 1
a368 12
where BASE and INDEX are the optional 32-bit base and index registers,
DISP is the optional displacement, and SCALE, taking the values 1, 2,
4, and 8, multiplies INDEX to calculate the address of the operand.  If
no SCALE is specified, SCALE is taken to be 1.  SECTION specifies the
optional section register for the memory operand, and may override the
default section register (see a 80386 manual for section register
defaults). Note that section overrides in AT&T syntax *must* have be
preceded by a `%'.  If you specify a section override which coincides
with the default section register, `as' does *not* output any section
register override prefixes to assemble the given instruction.  Thus,
section overrides can be specified to emphasize which section register
is used for a given memory operand.
d370 1
a370 1
   Here are some examples of Intel and AT&T style memory references:
d372 76
a447 4
AT&T: `-4(%ebp)', Intel:  `[ebp - 4]'
     BASE is `%ebp'; DISP is `-4'. SECTION is missing, and the default
     section is used (`%ss' for addressing with `%ebp' as the base
     register).  INDEX, SCALE are both missing.
d449 2
a450 3
AT&T: `foo(,%eax,4)', Intel: `[foo + eax*4]'
     INDEX is `%eax' (scaled by a SCALE 4); DISP is `foo'.  All other
     fields are missing.  The section register here defaults to `%ds'.
d452 2
a453 4
AT&T: `foo(,1)'; Intel `[foo]'
     This uses the value pointed to by `foo' as a memory operand.  Note
     that BASE and INDEX are both missing, but there is only *one* `,'.
     This is a syntactic exception.
d455 1
a455 3
AT&T: `%gs:foo'; Intel `gs:foo'
     This selects the contents of the variable `foo' with section
     register SECTION being `%gs'.
d457 4
a460 7
   Absolute (as opposed to PC relative) call and jump operands must be
prefixed with `*'.  If no `*' is specified, `as' always chooses PC
relative addressing for jump/call labels.

   Any instruction that has a memory operand *must* specify its size
(byte, word, or long) with an opcode suffix (`b', `w', or `l',
respectively).

Handling of Jump Instructions
-----------------------------

   Jump instructions are always optimized to use the smallest possible
displacements.  This is accomplished by using byte (8-bit) displacement
jumps whenever the target is sufficiently close.  If a byte displacement
is insufficient a long (32-bit) displacement is used.  We do not support
word (16-bit) displacement jumps (i.e. prefixing the jump instruction
with the `addr16' opcode prefix), since the 80386 insists upon masking
`%eip' to 16 bits after the word displacement is added.

   Note that the `jcxz', `jecxz', `loop', `loopz', `loope', `loopnz'
and `loopne' instructions only come in byte displacements, so that if
you use these instructions (`gcc' does not use them) you may get an
error message (and incorrect code).  The AT&T 80386 assembler tries to
get around this problem by expanding `jcxz foo' to

              jcxz cx_zero
              jmp cx_nonzero
     cx_zero: jmp foo
     cx_nonzero:

Floating Point
--------------

   All 80387 floating point types except packed BCD are supported.
(BCD support may be added without much difficulty).  These data types
are 16-, 32-, and 64- bit integers, and single (32-bit), double
(64-bit), and extended (80-bit) precision floating point.  Each
supported type has an opcode suffix and a constructor associated with
it.  Opcode suffixes specify operand's data types.  Constructors build
these data types into memory.

   * Floating point constructors are `.float' or `.single', `.double',
     and `.tfloat' for 32-, 64-, and 80-bit formats.  These correspond
     to opcode suffixes `s', `l', and `t'.  `t' stands for temporary
     real, and that the 80387 only supports this format via the `fldt'
     (load temporary real to stack top) and `fstpt' (store temporary
     real and pop stack) instructions.

   * Integer constructors are `.word', `.long' or `.int', and `.quad'
     for the 16-, 32-, and 64-bit integer formats.  The corresponding
     opcode suffixes are `s' (single), `l' (long), and `q' (quad).  As
     with the temporary real format the 64-bit `q' format is only
     present in the `fildq' (load quad integer to stack top) and
     `fistpq' (store quad integer and pop stack) instructions.

   Register to register operations do not require opcode suffixes, so
that `fst %st, %st(1)' is equivalent to `fstl %st, %st(1)'.

   Since the 80387 automatically synchronizes with the 80386 `fwait'
instructions are almost never needed (this is not the case for the
80286/80287 and 8086/8087 combinations).  Therefore, `as' suppresses
the `fwait' instruction whenever it is implicitly selected by one of
the `fn...' instructions.  For example, `fsave' and `fnsave' are
treated identically.  In general, all the `fn...' instructions are made
equivalent to `f...' instructions.  If `fwait' is desired it must be
explicitly coded.

Writing 16-bit Code
-------------------

   While GAS normally writes only "pure" 32-bit i386 code, it has
limited support for writing code to run in real mode or in 16-bit
protected mode code segments.  To do this, insert a `.code16' directive
before the assembly language instructions to be run in 16-bit mode.
You can switch GAS back to writing normal 32-bit code with the
`.code32' directive.

   GAS understands exactly the same assembly language syntax in 16-bit
mode as in 32-bit mode.  The function of any given instruction is
exactly the same regardless of mode, as long as the resulting object
code is executed in the mode for which GAS wrote it.  So, for example,
the `ret' mnemonic produces a 32-bit return instruction regardless of
whether it is to be run in 16-bit or 32-bit mode.  (If GAS is in 16-bit
mode, it will add an operand size prefix to the instruction to force it
to be a 32-bit return.)

   This means, for one thing, that you can use GNU CC to write code to
be run in real mode or 16-bit protected mode.  Just insert the statement
`asm(".code16");' at the beginning of your C source file, and while GNU
CC will still be generating 32-bit code, GAS will automatically add all
the necessary size prefixes to make that code run in 16-bit mode.  Of
course, since GNU CC only writes small-model code (it doesn't know how
to attach segment selectors to pointers like native x86 compilers do),
any 16-bit code you write with GNU CC will essentially be limited to a
64K address space.  Also, there will be a code size and performance
penalty due to all the extra address and operand size prefixes GAS has
to add to the instructions.

   Note that placing GAS in 16-bit mode does not mean that the resulting
code will necessarily run on a 16-bit pre-80386 processor.  To write
code that runs on such a processor, you would have to refrain from using
*any* 32-bit constructs which require GAS to output address or operand
size prefixes.  At the moment this would be rather difficult, because
GAS currently supports *only* 32-bit addressing modes: when writing
16-bit code, it *always* outputs address size prefixes for any
instruction that uses a non-register addressing mode.  So you can write
code that runs on 16-bit processors, but only if that code never
references memory.

Notes
-----

   There is some trickery concerning the `mul' and `imul' instructions
that deserves mention.  The 16-, 32-, and 64-bit expanding multiplies
(base opcode `0xf6'; extension 4 for `mul' and 5 for `imul') can be
output only in the one operand form.  Thus, `imul %ebx, %eax' does
*not* select the expanding multiply; the expanding multiply would
clobber the `%edx' register, and this would confuse `gcc' output.  Use
`imul %ebx' to get the 64-bit product in `%edx:%eax'.

   We have added a two operand form of `imul' when the first operand is
an immediate mode expression and the second operand is a register.
This is just a shorthand, so that, multiplying `%eax' by 69, for
example, can be done with `imul $69, %eax' rather than `imul $69, %eax,
%eax'.

   Normally the character `|' is treated as a comment character, which
means that it can not be used in expressions.  The `--bitwise-or'
option turns `|' into a normal character.  In this mode, you must
either use C style comments, or start comments with a `#' character at
the beginning of a line.

   If you use an addressing mode with a base register without specifying
the size, `as' will normally use the full 32 bit value.  For example,
the addressing mode `%a0@@(%d0)' is equivalent to `%a0@@(%d0:l)'.  You
may use the `--base-size-default-16' option to tell `as' to default to
using the 16 bit value.  In this case, `%a0@@(%d0)' is equivalent to
`%a0@@(%d0:w)'.  You may use the `--base-size-default-32' option to
restore the default behaviour.

   If you use an addressing mode with a displacement, and the value of
the displacement is not known, `as' will normally assume that the value
is 32 bits.  For example, if the symbol `disp' has not been defined,
`as' will assemble the addressing mode `%a0@@(disp,%d0)' as though
`disp' is a 32 bit value.  You may use the `--disp-size-default-16'
option to tell `as' to instead assume that the displacement is 16 bits.
In this case, `as' will assemble `%a0@@(disp,%d0)' as though `disp' is
a 16 bit value.  You may use the `--disp-size-default-32' option to
restore the default behaviour.

Sub-Instructions
................

   The D10V assembler takes as input a series of instructions, either
one-per-line, or in the special two-per-line format described in the
next section.  Some of these instructions will be short-form or
sub-instructions.  These sub-instructions can be packed into a single
instruction.  The assembler will do this automatically.  It will also
detect when it should not pack instructions.  For example, when a label
is defined, the next instruction will never be packaged with the
previous one.  Whenever a branch and link instruction is called, it
will not be packaged with the next instruction so the return address
will be valid.  Nops are automatically inserted when necessary.

   If you do not want the assembler automatically making these
decisions, you can control the packaging and execution type (parallel
or sequential) with the special execution symbols described in the next
section.

Special Characters
..................

   `;' and `#' are the line comment characters.  Sub-instructions may
be executed in order, in reverse-order, or in parallel.  Instructions
listed in the standard one-per-line format will be executed
sequentially.  To specify the executing order, use the following
symbols:
`->'
     Sequential with instruction on the left first.

`<-'
     Sequential with instruction on the right first.

`||'
     Parallel The D10V syntax allows either one instruction per line,
one instruction per line with the execution symbol, or two instructions
per line.  For example
`abs       a1      ->      abs     r0'
     Execute these sequentially.  The instruction on the right is in
     the right container and is executed second.

`abs       r0      <-      abs     a1'
     Execute these reverse-sequentially.  The instruction on the right
     is in the right container, and is executed first.

`ld2w    r2,@@r8+         ||      mac     a0,r0,r7'
     Execute these in parallel.

`ld2w    r2,@@r8+         ||'
`mac     a0,r0,r7'
     Two-line format. Execute these in parallel.

`ld2w    r2,@@r8+'
`mac     a0,r0,r7'

Register Names
..............

   You can use the predefined symbols `r0' through `r15' to refer to
the D10V registers.  You can also use `sp' as an alias for `r15'.  The
accumulators are `a0' and `a1'.  There are special register-pair names
that may optionally be used in opcodes that require even-numbered
registers. Register names are not case sensitive.

   Register Pairs
`r0-r1'

`r2-r3'

`r4-r5'

`r6-r7'

`r8-r9'

`r10-r11'

`r12-r13'

`r14-r15'
   The D10V also has predefined symbols for these control registers and
status bits:
`psw'
     Processor Status Word

`bpsw'
     Backup Processor Status Word

`pc'
     Program Counter

`bpc'
     Backup Program Counter

`rpt_c'
     Repeat Count

`rpt_s'
     Repeat Start address

`rpt_e'
     Repeat End address

`mod_s'
     Modulo Start address

`mod_e'
     Modulo End address

`iba'
     Instruction Break Address

`f0'
     Flag 0

`f1'
     Flag 1

`c'
     Carry flag

Addressing Modes
................

   `as' understands the following addressing modes for the D10V.  `RN'
in the following refers to any of the numbered registers, but _not_ the
control registers.
`RN'
     Register direct

`@@RN'
     Register indirect

`@@RN+'
     Register indirect with post-increment

`@@RN-'
     Register indirect with post-decrement

`@@-SP'
     Register indirect with pre-decrement

`@@(DISP, RN)'
     Register indirect with displacement

`ADDR'
     PC relative address (for branch or rep).

`#IMM'
     Immediate data (the `#' is optional and ignored)


File: as.info,  Node: D10V-Word,  Prev: D10V-Addressing,  Up: D10V-Syntax

@@WORD Modifier
..............

   Any symbol followed by `@@word' will be replaced by the symbol's value
shifted right by 2.  This is used in situations such as loading a
register with the address of a function (or any other code fragment).
For example, if you want to load a register with the location of the
function `main' then jump to that function, you could do it as follws:
     ldi     r2, main@@word
     jmp     r2

D30V Options
------------

   The Mitsubishi D30V version of `as' has a few machine dependent
options.

`-O'
     The D30V can often execute two sub-instructions in parallel. When
     this option is used, `as' will attempt to optimize its output by
     detecting when instructions can be executed in parallel.

`-n'
     When this option is used, `as' will issue a warning every time it
     adds a nop instruction.

`-N'
     When this option is used, `as' will issue a warning if it needs to
     insert a nop after a 32-bit multiply before a load or 16-bit
     multiply instruction.

Size Modifiers
..............

   The D30V version of `as' uses the instruction names in the D30V
Architecture Manual.  However, the names in the manual are sometimes
ambiguous.  There are instruction names that can assemble to a short or
long form opcode.  How does the assembler pick the correct form?  `as'
will always pick the smallest form if it can.  When dealing with a
symbol that is not defined yet when a line is being assembled, it will
always use the long form.  If you need to force the assembler to use
either the short or long form of the instruction, you can append either
`.s' (short) or `.l' (long) to it.  For example, if you are writing an
assembly program and you want to do a branch to a symbol that is
defined later in your program, you can write `bra.s foo'.  Objdump and
GDB will always append `.s' or `.l' to instructions which have both
short and long forms.


File: as.info,  Node: D30V-Subs,  Next: D30V-Chars,  Prev: D30V-Size,  Up: D30V-Syntax

Sub-Instructions
................

   The D30V assembler takes as input a series of instructions, either
one-per-line, or in the special two-per-line format described in the
next section.  Some of these instructions will be short-form or
sub-instructions.  These sub-instructions can be packed into a single
instruction.  The assembler will do this automatically.  It will also
detect when it should not pack instructions.  For example, when a label
is defined, the next instruction will never be packaged with the
previous one.  Whenever a branch and link instruction is called, it
will not be packaged with the next instruction so the return address
will be valid.  Nops are automatically inserted when necessary.

   If you do not want the assembler automatically making these
decisions, you can control the packaging and execution type (parallel
or sequential) with the special execution symbols described in the next
section.


File: as.info,  Node: D30V-Chars,  Next: D30V-Guarded,  Prev: D30V-Subs,  Up: D30V-Syntax

Special Characters
..................

   `;' and `#' are the line comment characters.  Sub-instructions may
be executed in order, in reverse-order, or in parallel.  Instructions
listed in the standard one-per-line format will be executed
sequentially unless you use the `-O' option.

   To specify the executing order, use the following symbols:
`->'
     Sequential with instruction on the left first.

`<-'
     Sequential with instruction on the right first.

`||'
     Parallel

   The D30V syntax allows either one instruction per line, one
instruction per line with the execution symbol, or two instructions per
line.  For example
`abs r2,r3 -> abs r4,r5'
     Execute these sequentially.  The instruction on the right is in
     the right container and is executed second.

`abs r2,r3 <- abs r4,r5'
     Execute these reverse-sequentially.  The instruction on the right
     is in the right container, and is executed first.

`abs r2,r3 || abs r4,r5'
     Execute these in parallel.

`ldw r2,@@(r3,r4) ||'
`mulx r6,r8,r9'
     Two-line format. Execute these in parallel.

`mulx a0,r8,r9'
`stw r2,@@(r3,r4)'
     Two-line format. Execute these sequentially unless `-O' option is
     used.  If the `-O' option is used, the assembler will determine if
     the instructions could be done in parallel (the above two
     instructions can be done in parallel), and if so, emit them as
     parallel instructions.  The assembler will put them in the proper
     containers.  In the above example, the assembler will put the
     `stw' instruction in left container and the `mulx' instruction in
     the right container.

`stw r2,@@(r3,r4) ->'
`mulx a0,r8,r9'
     Two-line format.  Execute the `stw' instruction followed by the
     `mulx' instruction sequentially.  The first instruction goes in the
     left container and the second instruction goes into right
     container.  The assembler will give an error if the machine
     ordering constraints are violated.

`stw r2,@@(r3,r4) <-'
`mulx a0,r8,r9'
     Same as previous example, except that the `mulx' instruction is
     executed before the `stw' instruction.

   Since `$' has no special meaning, you may use it in symbol names.

Guarded Execution
.................

   `as' supports the full range of guarded execution directives for
each instruction.  Just append the directive after the instruction
proper.  The directives are:

`/tx'
     Execute the instruction if flag f0 is true.

`/fx'
     Execute the instruction if flag f0 is false.

`/xt'
     Execute the instruction if flag f1 is true.

`/xf'
     Execute the instruction if flag f1 is false.

`/tt'
     Execute the instruction if both flags f0 and f1 are true.

`/tf'
     Execute the instruction if flag f0 is true and flag f1 is false.

   You can use the predefined symbols `r0' through `r63' to refer to
the D30V registers.  You can also use `sp' as an alias for `r63' and
`link' as an alias for `r62'.  The accumulators are `a0' and `a1'.

Register Names
..............

   You can use predefined symbols of the form `rNh' and `rNl' to refer
to the H8/300 registers as sixteen 8-bit general-purpose registers.  N
is a digit from `0' to `7'); for instance, both `r0h' and `r7l' are
valid register names.

   You can also use the eight predefined symbols `rN' to refer to the
H8/300 registers as 16-bit registers (you must use this form for
addressing).

   On the H8/300H, you can also use the eight predefined symbols `erN'
(`er0' ... `er7') to refer to the 32-bit general purpose registers.

   The two control registers are called `pc' (program counter; a 16-bit
register, except on the H8/300H where it is 24 bits) and `ccr'
(condition code register; an 8-bit register).  `r7' is used as the
stack pointer, and can also be called `sp'.

Addressing Modes
................

   as understands the following addressing modes for the H8/300:
`rN'
     Register direct

`@@rN'
     Register indirect

`@@(D, rN)'
`@@(D:16, rN)'
`@@(D:24, rN)'
     Register indirect: 16-bit or 24-bit displacement D from register
     N.  (24-bit displacements are only meaningful on the H8/300H.)

`@@rN+'
     Register indirect with post-increment

`@@-rN'
     Register indirect with pre-decrement

``@@'AA'
``@@'AA:8'
``@@'AA:16'
``@@'AA:24'
     Absolute address `aa'.  (The address size `:24' only makes sense
     on the H8/300H.)

`#XX'
`#XX:8'
`#XX:16'
`#XX:32'
     Immediate data XX.  You may specify the `:8', `:16', or `:32' for
     clarity, if you wish; but `as' neither requires this nor uses
     it--the data size required is taken from context.

``@@'`@@'AA'
``@@'`@@'AA:8'
     Memory indirect.  You may specify the `:8' for clarity, if you
     wish; but `as' neither requires this nor uses it.

   Four H8/300 instructions (`add', `cmp', `mov', `sub') are defined
with variants using the suffixes `.b', `.w', and `.l' to specify the
size of a memory operand.  `as' supports these suffixes, but does not
require them; since one of the operands is always a register, `as' can
deduce the correct size.

   For example, since `r0' refers to a 16-bit register,
     mov    r0,@@foo
is equivalent to
     mov.w  r0,@@foo

   If you use the size suffixes, `as' issues a warning when the suffix
and the register size do not match.

Special Characters
..................

   `!' is the line comment character.

   `;' can be used instead of a newline to separate statements.

   Since `$' has no special meaning, you may use it in symbol names.

Register Names
..............

   You can use the predefined symbols `r0', `r1', `r2', `r3', `r4',
`r5', `r6', and `r7' to refer to the H8/500 registers.

   The H8/500 also has these control registers:

`cp'
     code pointer

`dp'
     data pointer

`bp'
     base pointer

`tp'
     stack top pointer

`ep'
     extra pointer

`sr'
     status register

`ccr'
     condition code register

   All registers are 16 bits long.  To represent 32 bit numbers, use two
adjacent registers; for distant memory addresses, use one of the segment
pointers (`cp' for the program counter; `dp' for `r0'-`r3'; `ep' for
`r4' and `r5'; and `tp' for `r6' and `r7'.

Addressing Modes
................

   as understands the following addressing modes for the H8/500:
`RN'
     Register direct

`@@RN'
     Register indirect

`@@(d:8, RN)'
     Register indirect with 8 bit signed displacement

`@@(d:16, RN)'
     Register indirect with 16 bit signed displacement

`@@-RN'
     Register indirect with pre-decrement

`@@RN+'
     Register indirect with post-increment

`@@AA:8'
     8 bit absolute address

`@@AA:16'
     16 bit absolute address

`#XX:8'
     8 bit immediate

`#XX:16'
     16 bit immediate

   The ESA/390 `as' port is currently intended to be a back-end for the
GNU CC compiler.  It is not HLASM compatible, although it does support
a subset of some of the HLASM directives.  The only supported binary
file format is ELF; none of the usual MVS/VM/OE/USS object file
formats, such as ESD or XSD, are supported.

   When used with the GNU CC compiler, the ESA/390 `as' will produce
correct, fully relocated, functional binaries, and has been used to
compile and execute large projects.  However, many aspects should still
be considered experimental; these include shared library support,
dynamically loadable objects, and any relocation other than the 31-bit
relocation.

   The opcode/operand syntax follows the ESA/390 Principles of Operation
manual; assembler directives and general syntax are loosely based on the
prevailing AT&T/SVR4/ELF/Solaris style notation.  HLASM-style directives
are _not_ supported for the most part, with the exception of those
described herein.

   A leading dot in front of directives is optional, and the case of
directives is ignored; thus for example, .using and USING have the same
effect.

   A colon may immediately follow a label definition.  This is simply
for compatibility with how most assembly language programmers write
code.

   Since `$' has no special meaning, you may use it in symbol names.
d1194 1
a1194 29
   Registers can be given the symbolic names r0..r15, fp0, fp2, fp4,
fp6.  By using thesse symbolic names, `as' can detect simple syntax
errors. The name rarg or r.arg is a synonym for r11, rtca or r.tca for
r12, sp, r.sp, dsa r.dsa for r13, lr or r.lr for r14, rbase or r.base
for r3 and rpgt or r.pgt for r4.

   `*' is the current location counter.  Unlike `.' it is always
relative to the last USING directive.  Note that this means that
expressions cannot use multiplication, as any occurence of `*' will be
interpreted as a location counter.

   All labels are relative to the last USING.  Thus, branches to a label
always imply the use of base+displacement.

   Many of the usual forms of address constants / address literals are
supported.  Thus,
     	.using	*,r3
     	L	r15,=A(some_routine)
     	LM	r6,r7,=V(some_longlong_extern)
     	A	r1,=F'12'
     	AH	r0,=H'42'
     	ME	r6,=E'3.1416'
     	MD	r6,=D'3.14159265358979'
     	O	r6,=XL4'cacad0d0'
     	.ltorg
   should all behave as expected: that is, an entry in the literal pool
will be created (or reused if it already exists), and the instruction
operands will be the displacement into the literal pool using the
current base register (as last declared with the `.using' directive).
