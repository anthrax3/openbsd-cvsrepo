     if it is necessary to add CPU specific code to the object format
     file.  */

/*   This macro is the BFD target name to use when creating the output
     file.  This will normally depend upon the `OBJ_FMT' macro.  */

/*   You should define this macro to be non-zero if the target is big
     endian, and zero if the target is little endian.  */

     nonstandard escape sequences in a string.  */

     `number_to_chars_littleendian', whichever is appropriate.  On
     targets like the MIPS which support options to change the
     endianness, which function to call is a runtime decision.  On
     other targets, `md_number_to_chars' can be a simple macro.  */

     processing (*note Broken words::.).  Otherwise, you should set
     `md_short_jump_size' to the size of a short jump (a jump that is
     just long enough to jump around a long jmp) and
     `md_long_jump_size' to the size of a long jump (a jump that can go
     anywhere in the function), You should define
     `md_create_short_jump' to create a short jump around a long jump,
     and define `md_create_long_jump' to create a long jump.  */

     SIZE bytes will have.  The alignment is expressed as a power of
     two.  If no alignment should take place, the macro definition
     should do nothing.  Some targets define a `.bss' directive that is
