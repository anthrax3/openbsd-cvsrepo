.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This command will call the Tcl interpreter \fIcount\fR
times to evaluate \fIscript\fR (or once if \fIcount\fR isn't
specified).  It will then return a string of the form

which indicates the average amount of time required per iteration,

Time is measured in elapsed time, not CPU time.
