.SH NAME
fblocked \- Test whether the last input operation exhausted all available input
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBfblocked \fIchannelId\fR
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \fBfblocked\fR command returns 1 if the most recent input operation
on \fIchannelId\fR returned less information than requested because all
available input was exhausted.
For example, if \fBgets\fR is invoked when there are only three
characters available for input and no end-of-line sequence, \fBgets\fR
returns an empty string and a subsequent call to \fBfblocked\fR will
return 1.
