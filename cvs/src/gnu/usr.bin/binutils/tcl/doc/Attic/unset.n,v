.SH NAME
unset \- Delete variables
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBunset \fIname \fR?\fIname name ...\fR?
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This command removes one or more variables.
Each \fIname\fR is a variable name, specified in any of the
ways acceptable to the \fBset\fR command.
If a \fIname\fR refers to an element of an array then that
element is removed without affecting the rest of the array.
If a \fIname\fR consists of an array name with no parenthesized
index, then the entire array is deleted.
The \fBunset\fR command returns an empty string as result.
An error occurs if any of the variables doesn't exist, and any variables
after the non-existent one are not deleted.
