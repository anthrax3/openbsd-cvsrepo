.SH NAME
while \- Execute script repeatedly as long as a condition is met
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBwhile \fItest body\fR
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \fIwhile\fR command evaluates \fItest\fR as an expression
(in the same way that \fBexpr\fR evaluates its argument).
The value of the expression must a proper boolean
value; if it is a true value
then \fIbody\fR is executed by passing it to the Tcl interpreter.
Once \fIbody\fR has been executed then \fItest\fR is evaluated
again, and the process repeats until eventually \fItest\fR
evaluates to a false boolean value.  \fBContinue\fR
commands may be executed inside \fIbody\fR to terminate the current
iteration of the loop, and \fBbreak\fR
commands may be executed inside \fIbody\fR to cause immediate
termination of the \fBwhile\fR command.  The \fBwhile\fR command
always returns an empty string.
