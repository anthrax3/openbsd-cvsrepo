.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBpid \fR?\fIfileId\fR?
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
If the \fIfileId\fR argument is given then it should normally
refer to a process pipeline created with the \fBopen\fR command.
In this case the \fBpid\fR command will return a list whose elements
are the process identifiers of all the processes in the pipeline,
in order.
The list will be empty if \fIfileId\fR refers to an open file
that isn't a process pipeline.
If no \fIfileId\fR argument is given then \fBpid\fR returns the process
identifier of the current process.
All process identifiers are returned as decimal strings.

.SH KEYWORDS
file, pipeline, process identifier
