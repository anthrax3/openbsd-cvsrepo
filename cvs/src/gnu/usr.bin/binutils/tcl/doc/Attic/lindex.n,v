.SH NAME
lindex \- Retrieve an element from a list
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBlindex \fIlist index\fR
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This command treats \fIlist\fR as a Tcl list and returns the
\fIindex\fR'th element from it (0 refers to the first element of the list).
In extracting the element, \fIlindex\fR observes the same rules
concerning braces and quotes and backslashes as the Tcl command
interpreter; however, variable
substitution and command substitution do not occur.
If \fIindex\fR is negative or greater than or equal to the number
of elements in \fIvalue\fR, then an empty
string is returned.
.VS
If \fIindex\fR has the value \fBend\fR, it refers to the last element
in the list.
