.SH NAME
Tcl_Backslash \- parse a backslash sequence
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fB#include <tcl.h>\fR
.sp
char
\fBTcl_Backslash\fR(\fIsrc, countPtr\fR)
.SH ARGUMENTS
.AS char *countPtr
.AP char *src in
Pointer to a string starting with a backslash.
.AP int *countPtr out
If \fIcountPtr\fR isn't NULL, \fI*countPtr\fR gets filled
in with number of characters in the backslash sequence, including
the backslash character.
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This is a utility procedure used by several of the Tcl
commands.  It parses a backslash sequence and returns
the single character corresponding to the sequence.
\fBTcl_Backslash\fR modifies \fI*countPtr\fR to contain the number
of characters in the backslash sequence.
.PP
See the Tcl manual entry for information on the valid
backslash sequences.
All of the sequences described in the Tcl
manual entry are supported by \fBTcl_Backslash\fR.
