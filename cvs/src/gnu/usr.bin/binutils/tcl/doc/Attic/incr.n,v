.SH NAME
incr \- Increment the value of a variable
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBincr \fIvarName \fR?\fIincrement\fR?
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Increments the value stored in the variable whose name is \fIvarName\fR.
The value of the variable must be an integer.
If \fIincrement\fR is supplied then its value (which must be an
integer) is added to the value of variable \fIvarName\fR;  otherwise
1 is added to \fIvarName\fR.
The new value is stored as a decimal string in variable \fIvarName\fR
and also returned as result.
