.SH NAME
set \- Read and write variables
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBset \fIvarName \fR?\fIvalue\fR?
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Returns the value of variable \fIvarName\fR.
If \fIvalue\fR is specified, then set
the value of \fIvarName\fR to \fIvalue\fR, creating a new variable
if one doesn't already exist, and return its value.
If \fIvarName\fR contains an open parenthesis and ends with a
close parenthesis, then it refers to an array element:  the characters
before the first open parenthesis are the name of the array, and the characters
between the parentheses are the index within the array.
Otherwise \fIvarName\fR refers to a scalar variable.
If no procedure is active, then \fIvarName\fR refers to a global
variable.
If a procedure is active, then \fIvarName\fR refers to a parameter
or local variable of the procedure unless the \fIglobal\fR command
has been invoked to declare \fIvarName\fR to be global.
