Currently, the Macintosh version Tcl only compilies with the
CodeWarrior C compilier from MetroWerks.  It should be straight
forward to port the Tcl source to MPW.  However, because the Tcl
sources rely on the GUSI library for Posix support it would not
be as easy to port Tcl to the Think C compiliet from Symantic.

If you attempt to port Tcl to other Macintosh compiliers please
let me know.  I would be glad to help with advice and encouragement.
If your efforts are succesfull I wold also be interested in puting
those changes into the core distribution.  Furthermore, please feel
free to send me any notes you might make about your porting
experience so I may include them in this file for others to reference.
