 *
 *	This is useful for:

 *			includes: MK4 and AD1 (from OSF RI)
 *		OSF/1 1.3 (from OSF) using ROSE
 *		HP OSF/1 1.0 ("Acorn") using COFF
 *
 *	This is likely to be useful for:
 *		Paragon OSF/1 (from Intel) 
 *		HI-OSF/1 (from Hitachi) 
 *
 *	This is NOT to be used on:
 *		Digitial Alpha OSF/1 systems
 *		OSF/1 1.3 or later (from OSF) using ELF
 *			includes: MK6, MK7, AD2, AD3 (from OSF RI)
