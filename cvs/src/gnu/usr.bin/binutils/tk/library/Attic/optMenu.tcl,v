# tk_optionMenu --
# This procedure creates an option button named $w and an associated
# menu.  Together they provide the functionality of Motif option menus:
# they can be used to select one of many values, and the current value
# appears in the global variable varName, as well as in the text of
# the option menubutton.  The name of the menu is returned as the
# procedure's result, so that the caller can use it to change configuration
# options on the menu or otherwise manipulate it.
#
# Arguments:
# w -			The name to use for the menubutton.
# varName -		Global variable to hold the currently selected value.
# firstValue -		First of legal values for option (must be >= 1).
# args -		Any number of additional values.
