.TH Tk_QueueWindowEvent 3 7.5 Tk "Tk Library Procedures"
.BS
.SH NAME
Tk_QueueWindowEvent \- Add a window event to the Tcl event queue
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fB#include <tk.h>\fR
.sp
\fBTk_QueueWindowEvent\fR(\fIeventPtr, position\fR)
.SH ARGUMENTS
.AS Tcl_QueuePosition position
.AP XEvent *eventPtr  in
An event to add to the event queue.
.AP Tcl_QueuePosition position in
Where to add the new event in the queue:  \fBTCL_QUEUE_TAIL\fR,
\fBTCL_QUEUE_HEAD\fR, or \fBTCL_QUEUE_MARK\fR.
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This procedure places a window event on Tcl's
internal event queue for eventual servicing.  It creates a
Tcl_Event structure, copies the event into that structure,
and calls \fBTcl_QueueEvent\fR to add the event to the queue.
When the event is eventually removed from the queue it is
processed just like all window events.
.PP
The \fIposition\fR argument to \fBTk_QueueWindowEvent\fR has
the same significance as for \fBTcl_QueueEvent\fR;  see the
documentation for \fBTcl_QueueEvent\fR for details.

.SH KEYWORDS
callback, clock, handler, modal timeout
