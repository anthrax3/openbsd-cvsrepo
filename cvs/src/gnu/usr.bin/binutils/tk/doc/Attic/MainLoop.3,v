.SH NAME
Tk_MainLoop \- loop for events until all windows are deleted
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fB#include <tk.h>\fR
.sp
\fBTk_MainLoop\fR()
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBTk_MainLoop\fR is a procedure that loops repeatedly calling
\fBTcl_DoOneEvent\fR.  It returns only when there are no applications
left in this process (i.e. no main windows exist anymore).  Most
windowing applications will call \fBTk_MainLoop\fR after
initialization; the main execution of the application will consist
entirely of callbacks invoked via \fBTcl_DoOneEvent\fR.

.SH KEYWORDS
application, event, main loop
