.SH NAME
Tk_RestackWindow \- Change a window's position in the stacking order
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fB#include <tk.h>\fR
.sp
int
\fBTk_RestackWindow\fR(\fItkwin, aboveBelow, other\fR)
.SH ARGUMENTS
.AS Tk_Window aboveBelow
.AP Tk_Window tkwin in
Token for window to restack.
.AP int aboveBelow in
Indicates new position of \fItkwin\fR relative to \fIother\fR;
must be \fBAbove\fR or \fBBelow\fR.
.AP Tk_Window other in
\fITkwin\fR will be repositioned just above or below this window.
Must be a sibling of \fItkwin\fR or a descendant of a sibling.
If NULL then \fItkwin\fR is restacked above or below all siblings.
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBTk_RestackWindow\fR changes the stacking order of \fIwindow\fR relative
to its siblings.
If \fIother\fR is specified as NULL then \fIwindow\fR is repositioned
at the top or bottom of its stacking order, depending on whether
\fIaboveBelow\fR is \fBAbove\fR or \fBBelow\fR.
If \fIother\fR has a non-NULL value then \fIwindow\fR is repositioned
just above or below \fIother\fR.
.PP
The \fIaboveBelow\fR argument must have one of the symbolic values
\fBAbove\fR or \fBBelow\fR.
Both of these values are defined by the include file <X11/Xlib.h>.
