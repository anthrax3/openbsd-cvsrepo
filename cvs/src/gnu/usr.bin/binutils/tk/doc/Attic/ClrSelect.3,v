\fBTk_ClearSelection\fR(\fItkwin, selection\fR)
.VE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.VS
\fBTk_ClearSelection\fR cancels the selection specified by the atom 
\fIselection\fR for the display containing \fItkwin\fR.
The selection need not be in \fItkwin\fR itself or even in
\fItkwin\fR's application.
If there is a window anywhere on \fItkwin\fR's display that
owns \fIselection\fR, the window will be notified and the
selection will be cleared.
If there is no owner for \fIselection\fR on the display, then the
procedure has no effect.
