   Unfortunately, thanks to some legacy architectures, this doesn't

   (see MIPS).  Such architectures should be using different register
   numbers for the different sized views of identical registers.

   Anyway, the up-shot is that, until that mess is fixed, core code
   can end up being very confused - should the RAW or VIRTUAL size be
   used?  As a rule of thumb, use DEPRECATED_REGISTER_VIRTUAL_SIZE in
