 ***********************************************************************
 * Angel C Libary support channel protocol definitions
 *
 * $Revision: 1.2 $
 *     $Date: 1998/01/08 11:12:34 $
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * MESSAGE FORMAT
 * --------------
 * Format of the "data" section of C Lib Support Channel Messages.
 * You will notice that the format is much the same as the format
 * of ADP messages - this is so that multi-threaded C Libraries can
 * be supported.
 *
 *  unsigned32 reason     - Main C Library reason code.
 *  unsigned32 debugID    - Info. describing host debug world;
 *                          private to host and used in any target
 *                          initiated messages.
 *  unsigned32 OSinfo1    \ Target OS information to identify process/thread
 *  unsigned32 OSinfo2    / world, etc. These two fields are target defined.
 *  byte       args[n]    - Data for message "reason" code.
 *
 * The "debugID" is defined by the host-end of the protocol, and is used
 * by the host to ensure that messages are routed to the correct handler
 * program/veneer (eg. imagine several threads having opened stdout and
 * each writing to a different window in a windowed debugger).
 *
 * NOTE: The reason that there is no "size" information, is that the
 * message IDs themselves encode the format of any arguments.
 *
 * For further discussion of the format see adp.h
 *
 * N.B. All streams are little endian.
 *
 * CLIB REASON CODE
 * ----------------
 * The message reason codes contain some information that ties them to
 * the channel and direction that the message will be used with. This
 * will ensure that even if the message "#define name" is not
 * completely descriptive, the message reason code is.
 *
 *      b31    = direction. 0=Host-to-Target; 1=Target-to-Host;
 *      b30-16 = reserved. should be zero
 *      b15-0  = message reason code.
 *
 * Note that typically a request will be initiated by the target side, and
 * that the host will then respond with either an acknowledgement or some
 * data.  In either case the same reason code will be used, but the direction
 * bit will be reveresed.
