/*
 *  Function: Adp_OpenDevice

 *              finds a driver that will accept name and arg, then call

 *
 *  Pre-conditions: No previous open is still active
 *
 *    Params:
 *       Input: name    Identifies which device to open.  This can either be
 *                      a host specific identifier (e.g. "/dev/ttya",
 *                      "COM1:"), or a number which is used to refer to
 *                      `standard' interfaces, so "1" would be the first host
 *                      interface, "2" the second, and so on.
 *
 *              arg     Driver specific arguments.  For example, some serial
 *                      drivers accept speed and control arguments such as
 *                      "9600" or "19200/NO_BREAK".  These arguments are
 *                      completely free-form: it is the individual drivers
