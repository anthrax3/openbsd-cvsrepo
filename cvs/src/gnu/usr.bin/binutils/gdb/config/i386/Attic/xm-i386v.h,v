/* I'm running gdb 3.4 under 386/ix 2.0.2, which is a derivative of AT&T's
   Sys V/386 3.2.

   On some machines, gdb crashes when it's starting up while calling the
   vendor's termio tgetent() routine.  It always works when run under
   itself (actually, under 3.2, it's not an infinitely recursive bug.)
   After some poking around, it appears that depending on the environment
   size, or whether you're running YP, or the phase of the moon or something,
   the stack is not always long-aligned when main() is called, and tgetent()
   takes strong offense at that.  On some machines this bug never appears, but
   on those where it does, it occurs quite reliably.  */
