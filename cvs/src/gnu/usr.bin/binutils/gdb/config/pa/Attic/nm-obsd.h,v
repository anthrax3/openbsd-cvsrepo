#define ATTACH_DETACH

/* The PA-BSD kernel has support for using the data memory break bit
   to implement fast watchpoints.

   Watchpoints on the PA act much like traditional page protection
   schemes, but with some notable differences.

   First, a special bit in the page table entry is used to cause
   a trap when a specific page is written to.  This avoids having
   to overload watchpoints on the page protection bits.  This makes
   it possible for the kernel to easily decide if a trap was caused
   by a watchpoint or by the user writing to protected memory and can
   signal the user program differently in each case.  
   
   Second, the PA has a bit in the processor status word which causes
   data memory breakpoints (aka watchpoints) to be disabled for a single
   instruction.  This bit can be used to avoid the overhead of unprotecting
   and reprotecting pages when it becomes necessary to step over a watchpoint.


   When the kernel receives a trap indicating a write to a page which
   is being watched, the kernel performs a couple of simple actions.  First
   is sets the magic "disable memory breakpoint" bit in the processor
   status word, it then sends a SIGTRAP to the process which caused the
   trap.

   GDB will take control and catch the signal for the inferior.  GDB then
   examines the PSW-X bit to determine if the SIGTRAP was caused by a 
   watchpoint firing.  If so GDB single steps the inferior over the
   instruction which caused the watchpoint to trigger (note because the
   kernel disabled the data memory break bit for one instruction no trap
   will be taken!).  GDB will then determines the appropriate action to
   take.  (this may include restarting the inferior if the watchpoint
   fired because of a write to an address on the same page as a watchpoint,
   but no write to the watched address occured).  */

#define TARGET_HAS_HARDWARE_WATCHPOINTS	/* Enable the code in procfs.c */

	((type) == bp_hardware_watchpoint)

/* When a hardware watchpoint fires off the PC will be left at the
   instruction which caused the watchpoint.  It will be necessary for
   GDB to step over the watchpoint.

   On a PA running BSD, it is trivial to identify when it will be
   necessary to step over a hardware watchpoint as we can examine
   the PSW-X bit.  If the bit is on, then we trapped because of a 
   watchpoint, else we trapped for some other reason.  */

   The kernel will always set this bit before notifying the inferior
   that it hit a watchpoint.  Thus, the inferior can single step over
   the instruction which caused the watchpoint to fire.  This avoids
   the traditional need to disable the watchpoint, step the inferior,
