@Enable support for debugging pie programs. Code from Elena Zannoni's
<ezannoni at redhat dot com> pie branch in gdb cvs, less extraneous
parts and with some bug fixes. Debugging w/core files for pie programs
isn't working yet since AUXV data isn't included in our core files at

/* If the program uses ELF-style shared libraries, then calls to
   functions in shared libraries go through stubs, which live in a
   table called the PLT (Procedure Linkage Table).  The first time the
   function is called, the stub sends control to the dynamic linker,
   which looks up the function's real address, patches the stub so
   that future calls will go directly to the function, and then passes
   control to the function.

   If we are stepping at the source level, we don't want to see any of
   this --- we just want to skip over the stub and the dynamic linker.
   The simple approach is to single-step until control leaves the
   dynamic linker.

   However, on some systems (e.g., Red Hat's 5.2 distribution) the
   dynamic linker calls functions in the shared C library, so you
   can't tell from the PC alone whether the dynamic linker is still
   running.  In this case, we use a step-resume breakpoint to get us
   past the dynamic linker, as if we were using "next" to step over a
   function call.

   IN_SOLIB_DYNSYM_RESOLVE_CODE says whether we're in the dynamic
   linker code or not.  Normally, this means we single-step.  However,
   if SKIP_SOLIB_RESOLVER then returns non-zero, then its value is an
   address where we can place a step-resume breakpoint to get past the
   linker's symbol resolution function.

   IN_SOLIB_DYNSYM_RESOLVE_CODE can generally be implemented in a
   pretty portable way, by comparing the PC against the address ranges
   of the dynamic linker's sections.

   SKIP_SOLIB_RESOLVER is generally going to be system-specific, since
   it depends on internal details of the dynamic linker.  It's usually
   not too hard to figure out where to put a breakpoint, but it
   certainly isn't portable.  SKIP_SOLIB_RESOLVER should do plenty of
   sanity checking.  If it can't figure things out, returning zero and
   getting the (possibly confusing) stepping behavior is better than
   signalling an error, which will obscure the change in the
   inferior's state.  */

         when any thread is in a syscall.  Thus, we only want to reenable
         hardware watches when no threads are in a syscall.

/* Wrapper for PC_IN_SIGTRAMP that takes care of the need to find the
   function's name.

   In a classic example of "left hand VS right hand", "infrun.c" was
   trying to improve GDB's performance by caching the result of calls
   to calls to find_pc_partial_funtion, while at the same time
   find_pc_partial_function was also trying to ramp up performance by
   caching its most recent return value.  The below makes the the
   function find_pc_partial_function solely responsibile for
   performance issues (the local cache that relied on a global
   variable - arrrggg - deleted).

   Using the testsuite and gcov, it was found that dropping the local
   "infrun.c" cache and instead relying on find_pc_partial_function
   increased the number of calls to 12000 (from 10000), but the number
   of times find_pc_partial_function's cache missed (this is what
   matters) was only increased by only 4 (to 3569).  (A quick back of
   envelope caculation suggests that the extra 2000 function calls
   @@1000 extra instructions per call make the 1 MIP VAX testsuite run
   take two extra seconds, oops :-)

         This used to jump to step_over_function if we are stepping,
         which is wrong.

         Suppose the user does a `next' over a function call, and while
         that call is in progress, the inferior receives a signal for
         which GDB does not stop (i.e., signal_stop[SIG] is false).  In
         that case, when we reach this point, there is already a
         step-resume breakpoint established, right where it should be:
         immediately after the function call the user is "next"-ing
         over.  If we call step_over_function now, two bad things
         happen:

         - we'll create a new breakpoint, at wherever the current
         frame's return address happens to be.  That could be
         anywhere, depending on what function call happens to be on
         the top of the stack at that point.  Point is, it's probably
         not where we need it.

         - the existing step-resume breakpoint (which is at the correct
         address) will get orphaned: step_resume_breakpoint will point
         to the new breakpoint, and the old step-resume breakpoint
         will never be cleaned up.

         The old behavior was meant to help HP-UX single-step out of
         sigtramps.  It would place the new breakpoint at prev_pc, which
         was certainly wrong.  I don't know the details there, so fixing
         this probably breaks that.  As with anything else, it's up to
         the HP-UX maintainer to furnish a fix that doesn't break other

/* If the program uses ELF-style shared libraries, then calls to
   functions in shared libraries go through stubs, which live in a
   table called the PLT (Procedure Linkage Table).  The first time the
   function is called, the stub sends control to the dynamic linker,
   which looks up the function's real address, patches the stub so
   that future calls will go directly to the function, and then passes
   control to the function.

   If we are stepping at the source level, we don't want to see any of
   this --- we just want to skip over the stub and the dynamic linker.
   The simple approach is to single-step until control leaves the
   dynamic linker.

   However, on some systems (e.g., Red Hat's 5.2 distribution) the
   dynamic linker calls functions in the shared C library, so you
   can't tell from the PC alone whether the dynamic linker is still
   running.  In this case, we use a step-resume breakpoint to get us
   past the dynamic linker, as if we were using "next" to step over a
   function call.

   IN_SOLIB_DYNSYM_RESOLVE_CODE says whether we're in the dynamic
   linker code or not.  Normally, this means we single-step.  However,
   if SKIP_SOLIB_RESOLVER then returns non-zero, then its value is an
   address where we can place a step-resume breakpoint to get past the
   linker's symbol resolution function.

   IN_SOLIB_DYNSYM_RESOLVE_CODE can generally be implemented in a
   pretty portable way, by comparing the PC against the address ranges
   of the dynamic linker's sections.

   SKIP_SOLIB_RESOLVER is generally going to be system-specific, since
   it depends on internal details of the dynamic linker.  It's usually
   not too hard to figure out where to put a breakpoint, but it
   certainly isn't portable.  SKIP_SOLIB_RESOLVER should do plenty of
   sanity checking.  If it can't figure things out, returning zero and
   getting the (possibly confusing) stepping behavior is better than
   signalling an error, which will obscure the change in the
   inferior's state.  */

/* Wrapper for PC_IN_SIGTRAMP that takes care of the need to find the

   In a classic example of "left hand VS right hand", "infrun.c" was
   trying to improve GDB's performance by caching the result of calls
   to calls to find_pc_partial_funtion, while at the same time
   find_pc_partial_function was also trying to ramp up performance by
   caching its most recent return value.  The below makes the the
   function find_pc_partial_function solely responsibile for
   performance issues (the local cache that relied on a global
   variable - arrrggg - deleted).

   Using the testsuite and gcov, it was found that dropping the local
   "infrun.c" cache and instead relying on find_pc_partial_function
   increased the number of calls to 12000 (from 10000), but the number
   of times find_pc_partial_function's cache missed (this is what
   matters) was only increased by only 4 (to 3569).  (A quick back of
   envelope caculation suggests that the extra 2000 function calls
   @@1000 extra instructions per call make the 1 MIP VAX testsuite run

     If we were using hardware-single-step, we check prev_pc; if we just

     prevents us from decrementing the PC if we just stepped over a jump

     The last bit checks that we didn't hit a breakpoint in a signal handler
     without an intervening stop in sigtramp, which is detected by a new

         This used to jump to step_over_function if we are stepping,
         which is wrong.

         Suppose the user does a `next' over a function call, and while
         that call is in progress, the inferior receives a signal for
         which GDB does not stop (i.e., signal_stop[SIG] is false).  In
         that case, when we reach this point, there is already a
         step-resume breakpoint established, right where it should be:
         immediately after the function call the user is "next"-ing
         over.  If we call step_over_function now, two bad things
         happen:

         - we'll create a new breakpoint, at wherever the current
         frame's return address happens to be.  That could be
         anywhere, depending on what function call happens to be on
         the top of the stack at that point.  Point is, it's probably
         not where we need it.

         - the existing step-resume breakpoint (which is at the correct
         address) will get orphaned: step_resume_breakpoint will point
         to the new breakpoint, and the old step-resume breakpoint
         will never be cleaned up.

         The old behavior was meant to help HP-UX single-step out of
         sigtramps.  It would place the new breakpoint at prev_pc, which
         was certainly wrong.  I don't know the details there, so fixing
         this probably breaks that.  As with anything else, it's up to
         the HP-UX maintainer to furnish a fix that doesn't break other
         platforms.  --JimB, 20 May 1999 */
