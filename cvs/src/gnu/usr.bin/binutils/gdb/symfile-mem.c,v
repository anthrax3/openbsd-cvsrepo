@Enable support for debugging pie programs. Code from Elena Zannoni's
<ezannoni at redhat dot com> pie branch in gdb cvs, less extraneous
parts and with some bug fixes. Debugging w/core files for pie programs
isn't working yet since AUXV data isn't included in our core files at
the moment.

/* This file defines functions (and commands to exercise those
   functions) for reading debugging information from object files
   whose images are mapped directly into the inferior's memory.  For
   example, the Linux kernel maps a "syscall DSO" into each process's
   address space; this DSO provides kernel-specific code for some
   system calls.

   At the moment, BFD only has functions for parsing object files from
   memory for the ELF format, even though the general idea isn't
   ELF-specific.  This means that BFD only provides the functions GDB
   needs when configured for ELF-based targets.  So these functions
   may only be compiled on ELF-based targets.

   GDB has no idea whether it has been configured for an ELF-based
   target or not: it just tries to handle whatever files it is given.
   But this means there are no preprocessor symbols on which we could
   make these functions' compilation conditional.

   So, for the time being, we put these functions alone in this file,
   and have .mt files reference them as appropriate.  In the future, I
   hope BFD will provide a format-independent bfd_from_remote_memory
   entry point.  */
