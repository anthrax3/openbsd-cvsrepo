   probably unwise for the caller to hold pointers to it for very
   long; it probably lives in some objfile's obstacks.  */

                         void *lookup_func_baton);


/* If the null-terminated string pointed to by *LEXPTR begins with a
   macro invocation, return the result of expanding that invocation as
   a null-terminated string, and set *LEXPTR to the next character
   after the invocation.  The result is completely expanded; it
   contains no further macro invocations.

   Otherwise, if *LEXPTR does not start with a macro invocation,
   return zero, and leave *LEXPTR unchanged.

   Use LOOKUP_FUNC and LOOKUP_BATON to find macro definitions.

   If this function returns a string, the caller is responsible for
   freeing it, using xfree.

   We need this expand-one-token-at-a-time interface in order to
   accomodate GDB's C expression parser, which may not consume the
   entire string.  When the user enters a command like

      (gdb) break *func+20 if x == 5

   the parser is expected to consume `func+20', and then stop when it
   sees the "if".  But of course, "if" appearing in a character string
   or as part of a larger identifier doesn't count.  So you pretty
   much have to do tokenization to find the end of the string that
   needs to be macro-expanded.  Our C/C++ tokenizer isn't really
   designed to be called by anything but the yacc parser engine.  */
