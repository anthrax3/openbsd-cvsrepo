/* All of the name-scope contours of the program
   are represented by `struct block' objects.
   All of these objects are pointed to by the blockvector.

   Each block represents one name scope.
   Each lexical context has its own block.

   The blockvector begins with some special blocks.
   The GLOBAL_BLOCK contains all the symbols defined in this compilation
   whose scope is the entire program linked together.
   The STATIC_BLOCK contains all the symbols whose scope is the
   entire compilation excluding other separate compilations.
   Blocks starting with the FIRST_LOCAL_BLOCK are not special.

   Each block records a range of core addresses for the code that
   is in the scope of the block.  The STATIC_BLOCK and GLOBAL_BLOCK
   give, for the range of code, the entire range of code produced
   by the compilation that the symbol segment belongs to.

   The blocks appear in the blockvector
   in order of increasing starting-address,
   and, within that, in order of decreasing ending-address.

   This implies that within the body of one function
   the blocks appear in the order of a depth-first tree walk.  */
