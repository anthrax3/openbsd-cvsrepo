#ifndef CHARSET_H

/* If the target program uses a different character set than the host,
   GDB has some support for translating between the two; GDB converts
   characters and strings to the host character set before displaying
   them, and converts characters and strings appearing in expressions
   entered by the user to the target character set.

   At the moment, GDB only supports single-byte, stateless character
   sets.  This includes the ISO-8859 family (ASCII extended with
   accented characters, and (I think) Cyrillic, for European
   languages), and the EBCDIC family (used on IBM's mainframes).
   Unfortunately, it excludes many Asian scripts, the fixed- and
   variable-width Unicode encodings, and other desireable things.
   Patches are welcome!  (For example, it would be nice if the Java
   string support could simply get absorbed into some more general
   multi-byte encoding support.)

   Furthermore, GDB's code pretty much assumes that the host character
   set is some superset of ASCII; there are plenty if ('0' + n)
   expressions and the like.

   When the `iconv' library routine supports a character set meeting
   the requirements above, it's easy to plug an entry into GDB's table
   that uses iconv to handle the details.  */

/* In general, the set of C backslash escapes (\n, \f) is specific to
   the character set.  Not all character sets will have form feed
   characters, for example.

   The following functions allow GDB to parse and print control
   characters in a character-set-independent way.  They are both
   language-specific (to C and C++) and character-set-specific.
   Putting them here is a compromise.  */
