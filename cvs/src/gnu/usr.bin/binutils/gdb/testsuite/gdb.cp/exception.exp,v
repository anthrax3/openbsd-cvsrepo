# This file is part of the gdb testsuite.
# tests for exception-handling support
# Written by Satish Pai <pai@@apollo.hp.com> 1997-07-23
# Rewritten by Michael Chastain <mec.gnu@@mindspring.com> 2004-01-08

# This file used to have two copies of the tests with different
# compiler flags for hp-ux.  Instead, the user should set CXXOPTS
# or run runtest with --target_board unix/gdb:debug_flags="..."
# to choose the compiler flags.
#
# The interesting compiler flags are: "aCC +A -Wl,-a,-archive" .
# Static-linked executables use a different mechanism to get the
# address of the notification hook in the C++ support library.

# TODO: this file is not ready for production yet.  If you are working
# on C++ exception support for gdb, you can take out the "continue"
# statement and try your luck.  -- chastain 2004-01-09

# TODO: this file has many absolute line numbers.
# Replace them with gdb_get_line_number.

#
# The problem is that "re-throw" does not show a throw; only a catch.

# code is optimized for a throw into the same function.
