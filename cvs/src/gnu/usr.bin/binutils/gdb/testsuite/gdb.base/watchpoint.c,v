 *	not support breakpoints at labeled text points at this time.
 *
 *	One place we need is a marker for when we start executing our tests

 *
 *	Another problem we have to guard against, at least for the test
 *	suite, is that we need to ensure that the line that causes the
 *	watchpoint to be hit is still the current line when gdb notices
 *	the hit.  Depending upon the specific code generated by the compiler,
 *	the instruction after the one that triggers the hit may be part of
