/* This include file defines the interface between the main part
   of the debugger, and the part which is target-specific, or
   specific to the communications interface between us and the
   target.

   A TARGET is an interface between the debugger and a particular
   kind of file or process.  Targets can be STACKED in STRATA,
   so that more than one target can potentially respond to a request.
   In particular, memory accesses will walk down the stack of targets
   until they find a target that is interested in handling that particular
   address.  STRATA are artificial boundaries on the stack, within
   which particular kinds of targets live.  Strata exist so that
   people don't get confused by pushing e.g. a process target and then
   a file target, and wondering why they can't see the current values
   of variables any more (the file target is handling them and they
   never get to the process target).  So when you push a file target,
   it goes into the file stratum, which is always below the process
   stratum.  */

   information to the target.

   Return the number of bytes actually transfered, zero when no
   further transfer is possible, and -1 when the transfer is not
   supported.

   NOTE: cagney/2003-10-17: The current interface does not support a
   "retry" mechanism.  Instead it assumes that at least one byte will
   be transfered on each call.

   NOTE: cagney/2003-10-17: The current interface can lead to
   fragmented transfers.  Lower target levels should not implement
   hacks, such as enlarging the transfer, in an attempt to compensate
   for this.  Instead, the target stack should be extended so that it
   implements supply/collect methods and a look-aside object cache.
   With that available, the lowest target can safely and freely "push"
   data up the stack.

   NOTE: cagney/2003-10-17: Unlike the old query and the memory
   transfer mechanisms, these methods are explicitly parameterized by
   the target that it should be applied to.

   NOTE: cagney/2003-10-17: Just like the old query and memory xfer
   methods, these new methods perform partial transfers.  The only
   difference is that these new methods thought to include "partial"
   in the name.  The old code's failure to do this lead to much
   confusion and duplication of effort as each target object attempted
   to locally take responsibility for something it didn't have to
   worry about.

   NOTE: cagney/2003-10-17: With a TARGET_OBJECT_KOD object, for
   backward compatibility with the "target_query" method that this
   replaced, when OFFSET and LEN are both zero, return the "minimum"
   buffer size.  See "remote.c" for further information.  */

/* This include file defines the interface between the main part
   of the debugger, and the part which is target-specific, or
   specific to the communications interface between us and the
   target.

   A TARGET is an interface between the debugger and a particular
   kind of file or process.  Targets can be STACKED in STRATA,
   so that more than one target can potentially respond to a request.
   In particular, memory accesses will walk down the stack of targets
   until they find a target that is interested in handling that particular
   address.  STRATA are artificial boundaries on the stack, within
   which particular kinds of targets live.  Strata exist so that
   people don't get confused by pushing e.g. a process target and then
   a file target, and wondering why they can't see the current values
   of variables any more (the file target is handling them and they
   never get to the process target).  So when you push a file target,
   it goes into the file stratum, which is always below the process
   stratum.  */

/* Request the transfer of up to LEN 8-bit bytes of the target's

   information to the target.

   Return the number of bytes actually transfered, zero when no
   further transfer is possible, and -1 when the transfer is not
   supported.

   NOTE: cagney/2003-10-17: The current interface does not support a
   "retry" mechanism.  Instead it assumes that at least one byte will
   be transfered on each call.

   NOTE: cagney/2003-10-17: The current interface can lead to
   fragmented transfers.  Lower target levels should not implement
   hacks, such as enlarging the transfer, in an attempt to compensate
   for this.  Instead, the target stack should be extended so that it
   implements supply/collect methods and a look-aside object cache.
   With that available, the lowest target can safely and freely "push"
   data up the stack.

   NOTE: cagney/2003-10-17: Unlike the old query and the memory
   transfer mechanisms, these methods are explicitly parameterized by
   the target that it should be applied to.

   NOTE: cagney/2003-10-17: Just like the old query and memory xfer
   methods, these new methods perform partial transfers.  The only
   difference is that these new methods thought to include "partial"
   in the name.  The old code's failure to do this lead to much
   confusion and duplication of effort as each target object attempted
   to locally take responsibility for something it didn't have to
   worry about.

   NOTE: cagney/2003-10-17: With a TARGET_OBJECT_KOD object, for
   backward compatibility with the "target_query" method that this
   replaced, when OFFSET and LEN are both zero, return the "minimum"

   A TARGET is an interface between the debugger and a particular 
   kind of file or process.  Targets can be STACKED in STRATA, 
   so that more than one target can potentially respond to a request.
   In particular, memory accesses will walk down the stack of targets
   until they find a target that is interested in handling that particular
   address.  STRATA are artificial boundaries on the stack, within
   which particular kinds of targets live.  Strata exist so that
   people don't get confused by pushing e.g. a process target and then
   a file target, and wondering why they can't see the current values
   of variables any more (the file target is handling them and they
   never get to the process target).  So when you push a file target,
   it goes into the file stratum, which is always below the process
   stratum.  */

   remote protocols use a similar encoding.  However, it is

   distinguishing between various kinds of SIGSEGV, or not
   distinguishing hitting a breakpoint from finishing a single step).
