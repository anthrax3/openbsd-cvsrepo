         any way in the .debug_macinfo section to describe the effect
         of #line directives, so if you debug a YACC parser you'll get
         a macro table which only mentions the .c files generated by
         YACC, but symtabs that mention the .y files consumed by YACC.

         In the long run, we should extend the Dwarf macro info
         representation to handle #line directives, and get GCC to
         emit it.
