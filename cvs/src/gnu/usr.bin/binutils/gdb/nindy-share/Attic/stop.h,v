/******************************************************************
 *
 *   REASONS WHY NINDY CAN STOP EXECUTING AN APPLICATION PROGRAM
 *
 * When NINDY stops executing an application program that was running
 * under remote host ("gdb") control, it signals the host by sending
 * a single ^P.  The host can then query as to the reason for the halt.
 * NINDY responds with two bytes of information.
 *
 * The first byte is a boolean flag that indicates whether or not
 * the application has exited.
 *
 * If the flag is true, the second byte contains the exit code.
 *
 * If the flag is false, the second byte contains a "reason for
 * stopping" code.  This file defines the possible values of that
 * code.
 *
 * There are three categories of reasons why the halt may have occurred:
 * faults, traces, and software interactions.  The first two categories
 * are processor-dependent; the values of these codes are tightly coupled
 * to the hardware and should not be changed without first examining
 * src/nindy/common/fault.c.  The software interactions involve
 * communication between NINDY and the host debugger;  their codes are
 * arbitrary.
