.SH NAME
grodvi \- convert groff output to TeX dvi format
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B grodvi
[
.B \-dv
] [
.BI \-w n
] [
.BI \-F dir
] [
.IR files \|.\|.\|.
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B grodvi
is a driver for
.B groff
that produces \*(tx dvi format.
Normally it should be run by
.BR groff\ \-Tdvi .
This will run
.BR @@g@@troff\ \-Tdvi ;
it will also input the macros
.BR @@MACRODIR@@/tmac.dvi ;
if the input is being preprocessed with
.B @@g@@eqn
it will also input
.BR @@FONTDIR@@/devdvi/eqnchar .
.LP
The dvi file generated by
.B grodvi
can be printed by any correctly-written dvi driver.
The troff drawing primitives are implemented
using the tpic version 2 specials.
If the driver does not support these, the
.B \eD
commands will not produce any output.
.LP
There is an additional drawing command available:
.TP
.BI \eD'R\  dh\ dv '
Draw a rule (solid black rectangle), with one corner
at the current position, and the diagonally opposite corner
at the current position 
.RI +( dh , dv ).
Afterwards the current position will be at the opposite corner.  This
produces a rule in the dvi file and so can be printed even with a
driver that does not support the tpic specials unlike the other
.B \eD
commands.
.LP
The groff command
.BI \eX' anything '
is translated into the same command in the dvi file as would be
produced by
.BI \especial{ anything }
in \*(tx;
.I anything may not contain a newline.
.LP
Font files for
.B grodvi
can be created from tfm files using
.BR tfmtodit (@@MAN1EXT@@).
The font description file should contain the following
additional commands:
.Tp \w'\fBinternalname'u+2n
.BI internalname\   name
The name of the tfm file (without the
.B .tfm
extension) is
.IR name .
.TP
.BI checksum\  n
The checksum in the tfm file is
.IR n .
.TP
.BI designsize\  n
The designsize in the tfm file is
.IR n .
.LP
These are automatically generated by
.B tfmtodit.
.LP
In
.B troff
the
.B \eN
escape sequence can be used to access characters by their position
in the corresponding tfm file;
all characters in the tfm file can be accessed this way.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-d
Do not use tpic specials to implement drawing commands.
Horizontal and vertical lines will be implemented by rules.
Other drawing commands will be ignored.
.TP
.B \-v
Print the version number.
.TP
.BI \-w n
Set the default line thickness to
.I n
thousandths of an em. 
.TP
.BI \-F dir
Search directory
.IB dir /devdvi
for font and device description files.
.SH FILES
.TP
.B @@FONTDIR@@/devdvi/DESC
Device description file.
.TP
.B @@FONTDIR@@/devdvi/ F
Font description file for font
.IR F .
.TP
.B @@MACRODIR@@/tmac.dvi
Macros for use with
.BR grodvi .
.SH BUGS
Dvi files produced by
.B grodvi
use a different resolution (57816 units per inch) to those produced by
\*(tx.
Incorrectly written drivers which assume the resolution used by \*(tx,
rather than using the resolution specified in the dvi file will not
work with grodvi.
.LP
When using the
.B \-d
option with boxed tables,
vertical and horizontal lines can sometimes protrude by one pixel.
This is a consequence of the way \*(tx requires that the heights
and widths of rules be rounded.

1.1
log
@groff 1.15 plus local changes (insomnia strikes):
o moved *.man to *.$section_in and generate *.$section not *.n for bsd.man.mk
o modified groff Makefiles to not install man pages (we do it ourselves)
o use mkstemp everywhere
o don't install groff versions on mdoc macros, we want our own ones
