log
@groff 1.15 plus local changes (insomnia strikes):
o moved *.man to *.$section_in and generate *.$section not *.n for bsd.man.mk
o modified groff Makefiles to not install man pages (we do it ourselves)
o use mkstemp everywhere
o don't install groff versions on mdoc macros, we want our own ones

.SH NAME
groff_msafer \- groff -msafer macros
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B groff
.B \-msafer
[
.IR options .\|.\|.
]
[
.IR files .\|.\|.
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The -msafer macros remove the
.BR open ,
.BR opena ,
.BR pso ,
.BR sy ,
and
.B pi
requests.
These macros should be used when processing input from
an untrustworthy source.
For maximum safety,
they should be the first -m option on the command-line.
Normally they are invoked using the
.B \-S
option of groff, which will also pass
.B @@g@@pic
the
.B \-S
flag.
This is now the default; to get the old behaviour, use the
.B \-U
flag.
