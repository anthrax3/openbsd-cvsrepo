@This is the GNU groff document formatting system.  The version number
is given in the file VERSION.

Included in this release are implementations of troff, pic, eqn, tbl,
refer, the -man macros and the -ms macros, and drivers for PostScript,
TeX dvi format, HP LaserJet 4 printers, and typewriter-like devices.
Also included is a modified version of the Berkeley -me macros, an
enhanced version of the X11 xditview previewer, and an implementation
of the -mm macros contributed by Joergen Haegg (jh@@efd.lth.se).

See the file INSTALL for installation instructions.  You will require
a C++ compiler.

The file NEWS describes recent user-visible changes to groff.

Groff is free software. See the file COPYING for copying permission.

The file PROBLEMS describes various problems that have been
encountered in compiling, installing, and running groff.

For the moment, the documentation assumes that you are already
familiar with the Unix versions of troff, -man, -ms and the
preprocessors.

The most recent released version of groff is always available by
anonymous ftp from prep.ai.mit.edu in the directory pub/gnu.

Please report bugs using the form in the file BUG-REPORT; the idea of
this is to make sure that I have all the information I need to fix the
bug.  At the very least, read the BUG-REPORT form and make sure that
you supply all the information that it asks for.  Even if you are not
sure that something is a bug, report it using BUG-REPORT: this will
enable me to determine whether it really is a bug or not.

A CVS repository is now available, containing the current development
version of groff.  You can access it with the commands

  export CVSROOT=:pserver:anoncvs@@anoncvs.ffii.org:/var/cvs
  cvs login
  cvs -z9 co groff

(if the prompt for the password appears, just press the enter key).
After a successful login you no longer need the first two commands; an
update of a checked out repository should be done with

  cvs -z9 update -d

Please read the info pages of cvs for further details.

Alternatively, you can download snapshots (which are updated twice a
day) from

  ftp://ftp.ffii.org/pub/groff/devel/groff-current.tar.gz

or a diff file relative to the latest official groff release as

  ftp://ftp.ffii.org/pub/groff/devel/groff-<version>-current.diff.gz

Please report bugs using the form in the file BUG-REPORT; the idea of
this is to make sure that FSF has all the information it needs to fix

that you supply all the information that it asks for.  Even if you are

Three mailing lists are available:

  bug-groff@@gnu.org          for reporting bugs
  groff@@gnu.org              for general discussion of groff
  groff-commit@@ffii.org      a read-only list showing logs of
                             commitments to the CVS repository

Note that groff@@gnu.org is an alias for groff@@ffii.org; you must be
subscribed to the `groff' and `groff-commit' lists to send mails.

To subscribe, send a mail to <list>-request@@<domain> (example:
groff-request@@ffii.org) with the word `subscribe' in either the
subject or body of the email (don't include the quotes).

GNU groff was written by James Clark <jjc@@jclark.com>.  It is now
maintained by Ted Harding <ted.harding@@nessie.mcc.ac.uk> and Werner
Lemberg <wl@@gnu.org>.
