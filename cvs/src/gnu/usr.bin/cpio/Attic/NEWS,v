Major changes in version 2.4:

* new texinfo documentation
* --sparse option to write sparse files
* --only-verify-crc option to verify a CRC format archive
* --no-absolute-paths option to ignore absolute paths
* --quiet option to supress printing number of blocks copied
* handle disk input errors more gracefully

Major changes in version 2.3:

* in newc and crc format archives, only store 1 copy of multiply linked files
* handle multiply linked devices properly
* handle multiply linked files with cpio -pl even when the source and 
  destination are on different file systems
* support HPUX Context Dependent Files
* read and write HPUX cpio archives
* read System V.4 POSIX tar archives and HPUX POSIX tar archives
* use rmdir, instead of unlink, to delete existing directories

Major changes in version 2.2:

* handle link counts correctly when reading binary cpio archives
* configure checks for some libraries that SVR4 needs

Major changes in version 2.1:

* cpio can access remote non-device files as well as remote devices
* fix bugs in the MS-DOS port
* add --swap equivalent to -b option

Version 2.0 adds the following features:

Support for the SVR4 cpio formats, which can store inodes >65535, and
for traditional and POSIX tar archives.  Also adds these options:

-A --append		append to instead of replacing the archive
-V --dot		print a dot for each file processed
-H --format		select archive format
-C --io-size		select I/O block size in bytes
-M --message		print a message at end of media volumes
--no-preserve-owner	don't change files' owners when extracting
-R --owner		set files' owners when extracting
-E --pattern-file	list of shell filename patterns to process
-s --swap-bytes		handle byte-order differences when extracting files
-S --swap-halfwords	ditto
-b			like -sS
-I			input archive filename
-k			recognize corrupted archives (we alawys do it, though)
-O			output archive filename

Some options of previous versions have been renamed in 2.0:

--binary was replaced by --format=bin
--portability was replaced by --format=odc

Some options have changed meaning in 2.0, for SVR4 compatibility:

-O used to select the binary archive format, now selects the output file
-V used to print the version number, now prints a dot for each file

Version 2.0 also fixes several bugs in the handling of files with
multiple links and of multi-volume archives on floppy disks.
