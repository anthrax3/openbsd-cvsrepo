@new grep 2.4.1
whole bunch of bug fixes, mmap support (w/ --mmap)
changed binary file grep behavior, but could be overwritten w/ -a
millert@@ ok

text
@Write Texinfo documentation for grep.  The manual page would be a good
place to start, but Info documents are also supposed to contain a
tutorial and examples.

Fix the DFA matcher to never use exponential space.  (Fortunately, these
cases are rare.)

Improve the performance of the regex backtracking matcher.  This matcher
is agonizingly slow, and is responsible for grep sometimes being slower
than Unix grep when backreferences are used.

Provide support for the Posix [= =] and [. .] constructs.  This is
difficult because it requires locale-dependent details of the character
set and collating sequence, but Posix does not standardize any method
for accessing this information!
