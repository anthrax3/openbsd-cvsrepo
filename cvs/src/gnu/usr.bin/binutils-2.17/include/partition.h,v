/* This package implements a partition of consecutive integers.  The
   elements are partitioned into classes.  Each class is represented
   by one of its elements, the canonical element, which is chosen
   arbitrarily from elements in the class.  The principal operations
   on a partition are FIND, which takes an element, determines its
   class, and returns the canonical element for that class, and UNION,
   which unites the two classes that contain two given elements into a
   single class.

   The list implementation used here provides constant-time finds.  By
   storing the size of each class with the class's canonical element,
   it is able to perform unions over all the classes in the partition
   in O (N log N) time.  */

@Here comes the easter bunnytils 2.17 (the last version released against a
licence mere mortals can understand the terms of); will be connected to the
build on an arch-by-arch basis.

Testsuites and generated files have been intentionnaly omitted from this import.
