   The first GDB port requires flags in its remote memory access commands to

   eventually.  Stuff the page in the upper bits of a 32-bit address, since
   the c5x family only uses 16 or 23 bits.

   c2x, c5x and most c54x devices have 16-bit addresses, but the c548 has
   23-bit program addresses.  Make sure the page flags don't interfere.
   These flags are used by GDB to identify the destination page for
   addresses.

@Here comes the easter bunnytils 2.17 (the last version released against a
licence mere mortals can understand the terms of); will be connected to the
build on an arch-by-arch basis.

Testsuites and generated files have been intentionnaly omitted from this import.
