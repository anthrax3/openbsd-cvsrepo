@/* Yet Another Try at encapsulating bsd object files in coff.

 * We only use the coff headers to tell the kernel
 * how to exec the file.  Therefore, the only fields that need to 
 * be filled in are the scnptr and vaddr for the text and data
 * sections, and the vaddr for the bss.  As far as coff is concerned,
 * there is no symbol table, relocation, or line numbers.
 *
 * A normal bsd header (struct exec) is placed after the coff headers,
 * and before the real text.  I defined a the new fields 'a_machtype'
 * and a_flags.  If a_machtype is M_386, and a_flags & A_ENCAP is
 * true, then the bsd header is preceeded by a coff header.  Macros
 * like N_TXTOFF and N_TXTADDR use this field to find the bsd header.
 * 
 * The only problem is to track down the bsd exec header.  The
 * macros HEADER_OFFSET, etc do this.

@Here comes the easter bunnytils 2.17 (the last version released against a
licence mere mortals can understand the terms of); will be connected to the
build on an arch-by-arch basis.

Testsuites and generated files have been intentionnaly omitted from this import.
