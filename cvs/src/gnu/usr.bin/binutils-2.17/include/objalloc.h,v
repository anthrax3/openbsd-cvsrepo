/* These routines allocate space for an object.  The assumption is
   that the object will want to allocate space as it goes along, but
   will never want to free any particular block.  There is a function
   to free a block, which also frees all more recently allocated
   blocks.  There is also a function to free all the allocated space.

   This is essentially a specialization of obstacks.  The main
   difference is that a block may not be allocated a bit at a time.
   Another difference is that these routines are always built on top
   of malloc, and always pass an malloc failure back to the caller,
   unlike more recent versions of obstacks.  */

/* This is what an objalloc structure looks like.  Callers should not
   refer to these fields, nor should they allocate these structure
   themselves.  Instead, they should only create them via
   objalloc_init, and only access them via the functions and macros
   listed below.  The structure is only defined here so that we can

@Here comes the easter bunnytils 2.17 (the last version released against a
licence mere mortals can understand the terms of); will be connected to the
build on an arch-by-arch basis.

Testsuites and generated files have been intentionnaly omitted from this import.
