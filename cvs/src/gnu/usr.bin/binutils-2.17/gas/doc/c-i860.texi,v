@@section i860 Notes 
This is a fairly complete i860 assembler which is compatible with the
UNIX System V/860 Release 4 assembler. However, it does not currently
support SVR4 PIC (i.e., @@code{@@@@GOT, @@@@GOTOFF, @@@@PLT}).

Like the SVR4/860 assembler, the output object format is ELF32. Currently,
this is the only supported object format. If there is sufficient interest,
other formats such as COFF may be implemented.

Both the Intel and AT&T/SVR4 syntaxes are supported, with the latter
being the default.  One difference is that AT&T syntax requires the '%'
prefix on register names while Intel syntax does not.  Another difference
is in the specification of relocatable expressions.  The Intel syntax
is @@code{ha%expression} whereas the SVR4 syntax is @@code{[expression]@@@@ha}
(and similarly for the "l" and "h" selectors).

@@item -EL
Select little endian output (this is the default).
@@item -EB
Select big endian output. Note that the i860 always reads instructions
as little endian data, so this option only effects data and not
instructions.
@@item -mwarn-expand
Emit a warning message if any pseudo-instruction expansions occurred.
For example, a @@code{or} instruction with an immediate larger than 16-bits
will be expanded into two instructions. This is a very undesirable feature to
rely on, so this flag can help detect any code where it happens. One
use of it, for instance, has been to find and eliminate any place
where @@code{gcc} may emit these pseudo-instructions.
@@item -mxp
Enable support for the i860XP instructions and control registers.  By default,
this option is disabled so that only the base instruction set (i.e., i860XR)
is supported.
@@item -mintel-syntax
The i860 assembler defaults to AT&T/SVR4 syntax.  This option enables the
Intel syntax.

Both syntaxes allow for the standard @@code{.align} directive.  However,
the Intel syntax additionally allows keywords for the alignment
parameter: "@@code{.align type}", where `type' is one of @@code{.short}, @@code{.long},
@@code{.quad}, @@code{.single}, @@code{.double} representing alignments of 2, 4,
16, 4, and 8, respectively.

All of the Intel i860XR and i860XP machine instructions are supported. Please see
either @@emph{i860 Microprocessor Programmer's Reference Manual} or @@emph{i860 Microprocessor Architecture} for more information.
@@subsection Other instruction support (pseudo-instructions)
For compatibility with some other i860 assemblers, a number of
pseudo-instructions are supported. While these are supported, they are
a very undesirable feature that should be avoided -- in particular, when
they result in an expansion to multiple actual i860 instructions. Below
are the pseudo-instructions that result in expansions.
@@itemize @@bullet
@@item Load large immediate into general register:

The pseudo-instruction @@code{mov imm,%rn} (where the immediate does
not fit within a signed 16-bit field) will be expanded into:
@@smallexample
orh large_imm@@@@h,%r0,%rn
or large_imm@@@@l,%rn,%rn
@@end smallexample
@@item Load/store with relocatable address expression:

For example, the pseudo-instruction @@code{ld.b addr_exp(%rx),%rn} 
will be expanded into:
@@smallexample
orh addr_exp@@@@ha,%rx,%r31
ld.l addr_exp@@@@l(%r31),%rn
@@end smallexample

The analogous expansions apply to @@code{ld.x, st.x, fld.x, pfld.x, fst.x}, and @@code{pst.x} as well.
@@item Signed large immediate with add/subtract:

If any of the arithmetic operations @@code{adds, addu, subs, subu} are used
with an immediate larger than 16-bits (signed), then they will be expanded.
For instance, the pseudo-instruction @@code{adds large_imm,%rx,%rn} expands to:
@@smallexample 
orh large_imm@@@@h,%r0,%r31
or large_imm@@@@l,%r31,%r31
adds %r31,%rx,%rn
@@end smallexample
@@item Unsigned large immediate with logical operations:

Logical operations (@@code{or, andnot, or, xor}) also result in expansions.
The pseudo-instruction @@code{or large_imm,%rx,%rn} results in:
@@smallexample
orh large_imm@@@@h,%rx,%r31
or large_imm@@@@l,%r31,%rn
@@end smallexample

Similarly for the others, except for @@code{and} which expands to:
@@smallexample
andnot (-1 - large_imm)@@@@h,%rx,%r31
andnot (-1 - large_imm)@@@@l,%r31,%rn
