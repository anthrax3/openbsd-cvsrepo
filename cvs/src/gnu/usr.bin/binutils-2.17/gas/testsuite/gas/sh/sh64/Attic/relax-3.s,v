@Grr, this was supposed to be an import without the testsuite directories,
really.

@! Check relaxation for MOVI PC-relative expansions.  Unfortunately, we
! can't check the 32 and 48 bit limit on a host with 32-bit longs, so we
! just check going from first state to the second state.

! These PC-relative expressions are here because of past bugs leading to
! premature symbol evaluation and assignment when they were exposed to
! relaxation.
! The expected result may need future tweaking if advances are done in
! relaxation.  At the time of this writing the expressions are not
! relaxed although the numbers will be in the right range finally.

@Here comes the easter bunnytils 2.17 (the last version released against a
licence mere mortals can understand the terms of); will be connected to the
build on an arch-by-arch basis.

Testsuites and generated files have been intentionnaly omitted from this import.
