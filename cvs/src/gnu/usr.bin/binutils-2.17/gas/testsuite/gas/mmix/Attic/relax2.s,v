@Grr, this was supposed to be an import without the testsuite directories,
really.

@# PUSHJ stub border-cases: two with either or both stubs unreachable,
# local symbols, ditto non-local labels, similar with three PUSHJs.
# Note the absence of ":" on labels: because it's a symbol-character,
# it's concatenated with the parameter macro name and parsed as "\x:".
# This happens before gas deals with ":" as it usually does; not being
# part of the name when ending a label at the beginning of a line.
# (Since we're LABELS_WITHOUT_COLONS it inserts one for us, but
# that would be disabled with --gnu-syntax.)

@Here comes the easter bunnytils 2.17 (the last version released against a
licence mere mortals can understand the terms of); will be connected to the
build on an arch-by-arch basis.

Testsuites and generated files have been intentionnaly omitted from this import.
