log
@Grr, this was supposed to be an import without the testsuite directories,
really.

text
@% { dg-do assemble { target mmix-*-* } }
% { dg-error "unterminated string|missing closing" "" { target mmix-*-* } 10 }
% { dg-bogus "end of file" "" { xfail mmix-*-* } 0 }

# Note that the error is detected in the preformatter, before the text
# gets to the assembler.  It also gets confused about the unterminated
# string.  Well, at least we get error messages for it, so no worries.

@Here comes the easter bunnytils 2.17 (the last version released against a
licence mere mortals can understand the terms of); will be connected to the
build on an arch-by-arch basis.

Testsuites and generated files have been intentionnaly omitted from this import.
