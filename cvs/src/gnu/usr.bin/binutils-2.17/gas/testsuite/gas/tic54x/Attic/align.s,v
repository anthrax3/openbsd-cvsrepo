@* alignment directives
* .even == .align 1, .even 2 == longword boundary
* .align [size]  ; size is number of words (value must be a power of 2)
* NOTE: .even is broken on TI tools, so theirs won't align .data
* NOTE: TI defaults text section to DATA until opcodes are seen
* NOTE: GAS will fill a section to its alignment; it should probably not 
* in this case.

licence mere mortals can understand the terms of); will be connected to the
build on an arch-by-arch basis.

Testsuites and generated files have been intentionnaly omitted from this import.
