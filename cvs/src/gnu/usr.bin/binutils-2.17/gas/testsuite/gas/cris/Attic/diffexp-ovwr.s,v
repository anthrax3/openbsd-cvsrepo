; There are actually two regressions tested here:
; - That a .byte does not overwrite beyond the "byte", if given
;   a non-immediate-constant value (related to "False broken words").
; - That "quick-operands" (in this case, just the unsigned 6-bit
;   one is tested) can take "difference-expressions".

Testsuites and generated files have been intentionnaly omitted from this import.
