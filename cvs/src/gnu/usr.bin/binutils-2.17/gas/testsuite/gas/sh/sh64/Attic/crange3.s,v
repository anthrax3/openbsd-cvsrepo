@Grr, this was supposed to be an import without the testsuite directories,
really.

@! There was a bug in which a .cranges data hunk could include a hunk of
! code in front of it.  The following illustrates a function (start)
! followed by constants output into .rodata, followed by a function
! (continue), with a case-table (.L173) in it.  The bug included code from
! the start of the function (continue) into the case-table range descriptor.

@Here comes the easter bunnytils 2.17 (the last version released against a
licence mere mortals can understand the terms of); will be connected to the
build on an arch-by-arch basis.

Testsuites and generated files have been intentionnaly omitted from this import.
