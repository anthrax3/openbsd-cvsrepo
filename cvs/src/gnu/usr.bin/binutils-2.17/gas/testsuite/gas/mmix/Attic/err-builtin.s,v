@Grr, this was supposed to be an import without the testsuite directories,
really.

% When disallowing built-in names, we have to treat GET and PUT
% specially, so when parsing the special register operand we do
% not use the symbol table.  Make sure an error is emitted for
% invalid registers despite there being a valid user label and
% the construct being valid without the -no-builtin-syms option.
% FIXME: Another option?  Or is this just the consequence?

@Here comes the easter bunnytils 2.17 (the last version released against a
licence mere mortals can understand the terms of); will be connected to the
build on an arch-by-arch basis.

Testsuites and generated files have been intentionnaly omitted from this import.
