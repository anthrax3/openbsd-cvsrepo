@Grr, this was supposed to be an import without the testsuite directories,
really.

@#  One of the rule on restricted sequence is consecutive IU instruction 
#       IU: MUL, MAC, MACS, MSUB, MSUBS  (a)    
#       IU: MULHXpp, MULX2H, MUL2H      (b)
# This means that instructions in group (a) and in (b) should not be executed
# in IU in consecutive cycles in the order (a)->(b). It does neither prohibit
# executions in the reverse order (b)-> (a) nor consecutive execution of
# group (a)->(a) or (b)->(b)

@Here comes the easter bunnytils 2.17 (the last version released against a
licence mere mortals can understand the terms of); will be connected to the
build on an arch-by-arch basis.

Testsuites and generated files have been intentionnaly omitted from this import.

Peer pressure and ok from at least drahn@@ pirofti@@ deraadt@@
