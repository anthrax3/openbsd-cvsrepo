@Grr, this was supposed to be an import without the testsuite directories,
really.
@
text
@Notes on how the HPPA testsuite is organized:

basic.parse -- this directory contains the basic instruction parsing
tests and a simple .stab parsing test.  This would be where you'd
add code to make sure new instructions are parsed correctly, new
completers (such as cache hits) are parsed correctly, etc.

It's also a reasonable place to make sure parsing of the various
assembler directives is handled correctly.  If you're going to add
such code, try to be reasonably complete.  Add test code for each
basic directive and test all (or a noteworthy) subset of arguments.

It should only be necessary to have an assembler to run these tests;
calling objdump_start or something similar should not be done from
this directory.


more.parse -- this is where you should put additional parsing tests, such
as tests to check mode selector parsing, string parsing, expression parsing,
etc.  It's also a reasonable place to put parsing tests which are not complete
enough (whatever that means) for basic.parse.  

It should only be necessary to have an assembler to run these tests;
calling objdump_start or something similar should not be done from
this directory.


reloc -- this is where you tests which examine relocations produced
by GAS belong.  To run these tests you must have a functioning objdump.


unsorted -- this is where everything else goes.  As groups of related tests
end up in this directory, they should be broken out into a new class of
tests.

@Here comes the easter bunnytils 2.17 (the last version released against a
licence mere mortals can understand the terms of); will be connected to the
build on an arch-by-arch basis.

Testsuites and generated files have been intentionnaly omitted from this import.
