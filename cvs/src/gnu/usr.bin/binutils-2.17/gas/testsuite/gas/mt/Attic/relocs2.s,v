@Grr, this was supposed to be an import without the testsuite directories,
really.

	;; Note that the .org that follows is more or less equivalent
	;; to a .space, since the amount specified will be treated like
	;; padding to be added between the .data section in relocs1.s
	;; and this one.
	;; Note also that the two test variables (d2 & d3) are intentionally
	;; roughly $100 apart, so that the FR9 relocation processing in
	;; bfd/elf32-ip2k.c (ip2k_final_link_relocate) is tested a little more.

Testsuites and generated files have been intentionnaly omitted from this import.
