/* There are a number of different formats used for local labels.  gas
   expects local labels either of the form `10$:' or `n:', where n is
   a single digit.  When LOCAL_LABEL_DOLLARS is defined labels of the
   form `10$:' are expected.  When LOCAL_LABEL_FB is defined labels of
   the form `n:' are expected.  The latter are expected to be referred
   to using `nf' for a forward reference of `nb' for a backward
   reference.

   The local labels expected by the TI tools are of the form `$n:',
   where the colon is optional.  Now the $ character is considered to
   be valid symbol name character, so gas doesn't recognise our local
   symbols by default.  Defining LEX_DOLLAR to be 1 means that gas
   won't allow labels starting with $ and thus the hook
   tc_unrecognized_line() will be called from read.c.  We can thus
   parse lines starting with $n as having local labels.

   The other problem is the forward reference of local labels.  If a
   symbol is undefined, symbol_make() calls the md_undefined_symbol()
   hook where we create a local label if recognised.  */

@Here comes the easter bunnytils 2.17 (the last version released against a
licence mere mortals can understand the terms of); will be connected to the
build on an arch-by-arch basis.

Testsuites and generated files have been intentionnaly omitted from this import.
