/*"input_file.c":Operating-system dependant functions to read source files.*/

/*
 * No matter what the operating system, this module must provide the
 * following services to its callers.
 *
 * input_file_begin()			Call once before anything else.
 *
 * input_file_end()			Call once after everything else.
 *
 * input_file_buffer_size()		Call anytime. Returns largest possible
 *					delivery from
 *					input_file_give_next_buffer().
 *
 * input_file_open(name)		Call once for each input file.
 *
 * input_file_give_next_buffer(where)	Call once to get each new buffer.
 *					Return 0: no more chars left in file,
 *					   the file has already been closed.
 *					Otherwise: return a pointer to just
 *					   after the last character we read
 *					   into the buffer.
 *					If we can only read 0 characters, then
 *					end-of-file is faked.
 *
 * input_file_push()			Push state, which can be restored
 *					later.  Does implicit input_file_begin.
 *					Returns char * to saved state.
 *
 * input_file_pop (arg)			Pops previously saved state.
 *
 * input_file_close ()			Closes opened file.
 *
 * All errors are reported (using as_perror) so caller doesn't have to think
 * about I/O errors. No I/O errors are fatal: an end-of-file may be faked.

@Here comes the easter bunnytils 2.17 (the last version released against a
licence mere mortals can understand the terms of); will be connected to the
build on an arch-by-arch basis.

Testsuites and generated files have been intentionnaly omitted from this import.
