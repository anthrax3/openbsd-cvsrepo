/* A code fragment (frag) is some known number of chars, followed by some
   unknown number of chars. Typically the unknown number of chars is an
   instruction address whose size is yet unknown. We always know the greatest
   possible size the unknown number of chars may become, and reserve that
   much room at the end of the frag.
   Once created, frags do not change address during assembly.
   We chain the frags in (a) forward-linked list(s). The object-file address
   of the 1st char of a frag is generally not known until after relax().
   Many things at assembly time describe an address by {object-file-address
   of a particular frag}+offset.

   BUG: it may be smarter to have a single pointer off to various different
   notes for different frag kinds.  See how code pans.  */

@Here comes the easter bunnytils 2.17 (the last version released against a
licence mere mortals can understand the terms of); will be connected to the
build on an arch-by-arch basis.

Testsuites and generated files have been intentionnaly omitted from this import.
