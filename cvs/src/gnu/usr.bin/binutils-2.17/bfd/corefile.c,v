        though we're not sure that core file and executable match.
        This is to avoid generating a false warning in situations
        where we really don't know whether they match or not.

log
@Here comes the easter bunnytils 2.17 (the last version released against a
licence mere mortals can understand the terms of); will be connected to the
build on an arch-by-arch basis.

Testsuites and generated files have been intentionnaly omitted from this import.
