@Revert 1.2, which used to be necessary during the early ld 2.17 work, but

1.2
log
@Revert alpha/OpenBSD to the binutils 2.15 state, with only DATA_PLT and
disable readonly plt. This lets a binutils 2.17 toolchain produce working
binaries, until a working way to get proper padding sections (and boundary
symbols) emitted with proper value once .plt position is decided is found,
when .plt can exist at multiple places in the binary.

1.1
log
@A first attempt at merging our local changes and fixes into the 2.17 codebase.
ld(1) needs a lot more work, as the upstream code evolved significantly since
2.15, mostly due to changes in PIE binaries layout, and we had already
diverged significantly to implement W^X.
