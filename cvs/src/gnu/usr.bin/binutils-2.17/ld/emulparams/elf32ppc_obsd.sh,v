@provide both TRAP and NOP values for our architectures, then change
elf.sc to FILL .text segment with TRAP.  .init/.fini remain NOP FILL.

It is possible that some of these TRAP values aren't perfect yet, but
they can be changed.  When doing so also change the ld.script and gap.o
TRAP value.

@Cover your kid's remaining eye and lock up the pets for the great old ones
have been disturbed: rework the linker script and then enable RELRO support
on all but mips64 (something something padding) and m88k (untested).
This extends the RO coverage from just .got and .cdtors to also include
.openbsd.randomdata, .jcr, .dynamic, and .data.rel.ro., and moves more
segments from the text section to the rodata section.  Depends on the
previous csu and ld.so work; reinstall those *before* rebuilding ld, or
just get a snapshot.

@Enable missing code to fully enable the Secure-PLT ABI and clean up the
remaining commented out variable settings.  We'll continue to use the
same layout for both BSS-PLT and Secure-PLT since supporting the more
relro friendly layout that Linux uses isn't compatible with our way of
making the PLT and GOT read-only.

@Revert ppc/OpenBSD to the binutils 2.15 state, with only BSS_PLT and
disable secure plt. This lets a binutils 2.17 toolchain produce working
binaries, until a working way to get proper padding sections (and boundary
symbols) emitted with proper value once .plt position is decided is found,
when .plt can exist at multiple places in the binary.

log
@A first attempt at merging our local changes and fixes into the 2.17 codebase.
ld(1) needs a lot more work, as the upstream code evolved significantly since
2.15, mostly due to changes in PIE binaries layout, and we had already
diverged significantly to implement W^X.
