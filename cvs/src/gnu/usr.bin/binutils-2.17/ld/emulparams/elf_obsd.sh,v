@Unset SEPARATE_GOTPLT.  We don't want a seperate .got.plt section on OpenBSD,
at least for now, as it would result in a partially writable GOT.  Our
ld.so(1) has the smarts to properly write-protect the single .got, so we
don't need this.

@A first attempt at merging our local changes and fixes into the 2.17 codebase.
ld(1) needs a lot more work, as the upstream code evolved significantly since
2.15, mostly due to changes in PIE binaries layout, and we had already
diverged significantly to implement W^X.
