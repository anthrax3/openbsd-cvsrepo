@Grr, this was supposed to be an import without the testsuite directories,
really.

# Make sure relocations against global and local symbols with relative and
# absolute 32-bit relocs don't come out wrong after ld -r.  Remember that
# SH uses partial_inplace (sort-of REL within RELA) with related confusion
# about how, when, where and which addends to use.  A DSO must have the
# same value in the addend as in the data, so either can be used.

@Here comes the easter bunnytils 2.17 (the last version released against a
licence mere mortals can understand the terms of); will be connected to the
build on an arch-by-arch basis.

Testsuites and generated files have been intentionnaly omitted from this import.
