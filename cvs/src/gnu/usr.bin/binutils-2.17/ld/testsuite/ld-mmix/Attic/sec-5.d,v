@Grr, this was supposed to be an import without the testsuite directories,
really.

# Check that sections are automatically created to cope with contents at
# unexpected addresses when an mmo is read in.  We used to do this by
# e.g. linking .text at an unexpected address, like in sec-9.d.  That no
# longer works, because .text and .data now gets section descriptors at
# mmo output when the address and contents doesn't trivially reflect the
# section contents at link time.  To test, we instead read in an mmo
# formed from a link to binary format, like the b-*.d tests for mmo
# execution paths.

@Here comes the easter bunnytils 2.17 (the last version released against a
licence mere mortals can understand the terms of); will be connected to the
build on an arch-by-arch basis.

Testsuites and generated files have been intentionnaly omitted from this import.
