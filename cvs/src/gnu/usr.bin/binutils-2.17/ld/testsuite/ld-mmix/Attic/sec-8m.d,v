@Grr, this was supposed to be an import without the testsuite directories,
really.

#source: sec-8d.s
#ld: -m mmo
#objdump: -s

# Distantly related to sec-7m.s in that section lengths mattered for the
# bug.  When one input-section (seen in mmo.c as a chunk of data to
# output) had a length not a multiple of four, the last bytes were saved
# to be concatenated with the next chunk.  If it was followed by a chunk
# with a leading multiple-of-four number of zero bytes, those zero bytes
# would be omitted, and the "saved" bytes would be concatenated with the
# following (not-all-zeros) bytes.  Hence a shift of the last bytes of the
# first chunk.

@Here comes the easter bunnytils 2.17 (the last version released against a
licence mere mortals can understand the terms of); will be connected to the
build on an arch-by-arch basis.

Testsuites and generated files have been intentionnaly omitted from this import.
