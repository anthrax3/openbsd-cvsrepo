@Grr, this was supposed to be an import without the testsuite directories,
really.

@;# Main file, x.s, with the program (_start) referring to two
;# linkonce functions fn and fn2.  The functions fn and fn2 are
;# supposed to be equivalent of C++ template instantiations; the
;# main file instantiates fn.  There's the equivalent of an FDE
;# entry in .eh_frame, referring to fn via a local label.
