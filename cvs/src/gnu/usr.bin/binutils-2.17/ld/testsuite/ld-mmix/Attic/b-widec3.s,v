@Grr, this was supposed to be an import without the testsuite directories,
really.
@
text
@% The .text contents is supposed to be linked --oformat binary with
% b-twoinsn.s, and will provide a valid end of a mmo file, but with the
% "n" in :Main in wide character format; the widening is with a nil, so it
% is treated like a normal "n".  Also, it provides a normal "n", so the
% two symbols collide.
