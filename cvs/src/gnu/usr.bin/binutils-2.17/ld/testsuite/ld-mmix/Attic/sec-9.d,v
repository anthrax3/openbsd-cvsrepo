@Grr, this was supposed to be an import without the testsuite directories,
really.

text
@#source: start.s
#ld: -m mmo -T $srcdir/$subdir/mmosec2.ld
#objdump: -sh

# This is based on sec-5.d which used to link .text at an unexpected
# address to check that a special section was created in objdump when
# reading in contents at an unusual location without a proper section
# descriptor.  As .text (like .data) now gets a section descriptor when
# linked to an unexpected location, the old test is transformed into a
# specific check that the section description for .text works.

@Here comes the easter bunnytils 2.17 (the last version released against a
licence mere mortals can understand the terms of); will be connected to the
build on an arch-by-arch basis.

Testsuites and generated files have been intentionnaly omitted from this import.
