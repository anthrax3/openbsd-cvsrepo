# GOTOFF relocs against global symbols with non-default
# visibility got a linker error.  (A non-default visibility is
# to be treated as a local definition for the reloc.)  We also
# make sure we don't get unnecessary dynamic relocations.

Testsuites and generated files have been intentionnaly omitted from this import.
