@Grr, this was supposed to be an import without the testsuite directories,

# Check that 32-bit branches (PCREL:s) are relocated right.
# Source code and "-m criself" doesn't work with *-linux-gnu.

build on an arch-by-arch basis.

Testsuites and generated files have been intentionnaly omitted from this import.
