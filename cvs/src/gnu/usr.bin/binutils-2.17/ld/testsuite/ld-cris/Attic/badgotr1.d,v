@Grr, this was supposed to be an import without the testsuite directories,
really.

# The error regex above is supposed to not match if we get a
# SEGV, in which case we'll see "child killed: segmentation
# violation", supposedly at the beginning (seen) or end (in
# theory) of it.  The input ELF type (with underscores on
# symbols) mismatches the output type (no underscores).

@Here comes the easter bunnytils 2.17 (the last version released against a
licence mere mortals can understand the terms of); will be connected to the
build on an arch-by-arch basis.

Testsuites and generated files have been intentionnaly omitted from this import.
