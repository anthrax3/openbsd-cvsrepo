@Grr, this was supposed to be an import without the testsuite directories,
really.

@;# Library file y.s has linkonce entries for fn and fn2.  Note
;# that this version of fn has different code, as if compiled
;# with different optimization flags than the one in x.s (not
;# important for this test, though).  The reference from
;# .eh_frame to the linkonce-excluded fn2 must be zero, or g++
;# EH will not work.

@Here comes the easter bunnytils 2.17 (the last version released against a
licence mere mortals can understand the terms of); will be connected to the
build on an arch-by-arch basis.

Testsuites and generated files have been intentionnaly omitted from this import.
