@Grr, this was supposed to be an import without the testsuite directories,
really.

{
  TEXTMEM (ARX) : ORIGIN = 0x100, LENGTH = 32K
  DATAMEM (AW)  : org = 0x1000, l = (64 * 1024)

  . = 0;
  .text :
  {
    /* The value returned by the ORIGIN operator is a constant.
       However it is being assigned to a symbol declared within
       a section.  Therefore the symbol is section-relative and
       its value will include the offset of that section from
       the start of memory.  ie the declaration:
          text_start = ORIGIN (TEXTMEM);
       here will result in text_start having a value of 0x200.
       Hence we need to subtract the absolute value of the
       location counter at this point in order to give text_start
       a value that is truely absolute, and which coincidentally
       will allow the tests in script.exp to work.  */

@Here comes the easter bunnytils 2.17 (the last version released against a
licence mere mortals can understand the terms of); will be connected to the
build on an arch-by-arch basis.

Testsuites and generated files have been intentionnaly omitted from this import.
