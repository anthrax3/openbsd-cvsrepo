@Grr, this was supposed to be an import without the testsuite directories,
really.

@#name: JAL overflow
#source: jaloverflow.s
#as:
#ld: -Ttext=0xffffff0 -e start
#error: .*relocation truncated to fit.*

# This tests whether we correctly detect overflow in the jal
# instruction.  jal is a bit weird since the upper four bits of the
# destination address are taken from the source address.  So overflow
# occurs if the source and destination address do not have the same
# most significant four bits.

@Here comes the easter bunnytils 2.17 (the last version released against a
licence mere mortals can understand the terms of); will be connected to the
build on an arch-by-arch basis.

Testsuites and generated files have been intentionnaly omitted from this import.
