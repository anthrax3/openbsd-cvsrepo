	   appear to generate magic section symbols for this purpose.
	   Where we can, we catch such symbols and use our own. This of
	   course is something less than a perfect strategy.
	2. The table of contents is placed immediately after idata4.
	   The ".private.toc" sections are generated by the ppc bfd. The
	   .toc variable is generated by gas, and resolved here. It is
	   used to initialized function descriptors (and anyone else who
	   needs the address of the module's toc). The only thing 
	   interesting about it at all? Most ppc instructions using it
	   have a 16bit displacement field. The convention for addressing
	   is to initialize the .toc value to 32K past the start of the
	   actual toc, and subtract 32K from all references, thus using
	   the entire 64K range. Naturally, the reloc code must agree

@Here comes the easter bunnytils 2.17 (the last version released against a
licence mere mortals can understand the terms of); will be connected to the
build on an arch-by-arch basis.

Testsuites and generated files have been intentionnaly omitted from this import.
