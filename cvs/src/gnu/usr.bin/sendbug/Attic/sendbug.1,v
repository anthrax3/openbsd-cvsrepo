.Dt SENDBUG 1
.Sh NAME
.Nm sendbug
.Nd report a bug in
.Ox
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm sendbug
.Op Fl LPV
.Op Fl -version
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a tool used to submit
.Em problem reports
(PRs) to the
.Ox
bugs database.
.Nm
invokes an editor on a problem report template (after filling
in some fields with reasonable default values).
When you exit the editor,
.Nm
sends the completed form to the
.Ox
bugs database.
The PR will be assigned a unique number and stored in the bugs database
according to its category.
An automatic reply will be sent with an acknowledgement, citing the category
and the PR number.
.Pp
The bugs database can be queried using the online bug tracking system
available at
.Pa http://www.openbsd.org/query-pr.html .
This allows users to search for PRs based on either their PR number
or content.
.Pp
To ensure that a PR is handled promptly, it should specify one of the
available
.Em categories
to identify the problem area.
Use
.Nm
.Fl L
to see a list of categories.
.Pp
The more precise your problem description and the more complete your
information, the faster the
.Ox
team will be able to solve your problem.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl L
Print the list of available categories.
No mail is sent.
.It Fl P
Print the form specified by the environment variable
.Ev PR_FORM
on standard output.
If
.Ev PR_FORM
is not set, print the standard blank PR template.
No mail is sent.
.It Fl V
Display the
.Nm
version number.
.It Fl -version
Same as
.Fl V .
.El
.Pp
Note: Use
.Nm
to submit problem reports rather than mailing them directly.
Using both the template and
.Nm
itself will help ensure all necessary information will reach the
.Ox
bugs database.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width "PR_FORM"
.It Ev EDITOR
Specifies the editor to invoke on the template.
The default editor is
.Pa /usr/bin/vi .
.It Ev PR_FORM
Used as the file name of the template for your problem-report editing session.
You can use this to start with a partially completed form (for example,
a form with the identification fields already completed).
.El
.Sh HOW TO FILL OUT A PROBLEM REPORT
Problem reports have to be in a particular form so that a program can
easily manage them.
Please remember the following guidelines:
.Bl -bullet
.It
Describe only
.Em one problem
per problem report.
.It
For follow-up mail, use the same subject line as the one in the automatic
acknowledgement.
It consists of category, PR number and the original synopsis line.
This allows the bugs database to relate several mail messages to a
particular PR and to record them automatically.
.It
Please try to be as accurate as possible in the subject and/or synopsis line.
.It
The content of the PR is not confidential; it is sent out to a public
mailing list.
Sensitive, security-related issues should be sent via email to
.Aq security@@OpenBSD.org .
.El
.Sh HOW TO SUBMIT TEST CASES, CODE, ETC.
Submit small code samples with the PR.
Contact
.Aq bugs@@OpenBSD.org
for instructions on submitting larger test cases and problematic source code.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width "/tmp/pbad.XXXXXXXXXX" -compact
.It Pa /tmp/p.XXXXXXXXXX
copy of PR used in editing session
.It Pa /tmp/pf.XXXXXXXXXX
copy of empty PR form (testing purposes)
