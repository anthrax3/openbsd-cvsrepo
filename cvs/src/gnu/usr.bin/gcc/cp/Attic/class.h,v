/* The following structure is used when comparing various alternatives
   for overloading.  The unsigned quantity `strikes.i' is used
   for fast comparison of two possibilities.  This number is an
   aggregate of four constituents:

     EVIL: if this is non-zero, then the candidate should not be considered
     ELLIPSIS: if this is non-zero, then some actual argument has been matched
               against an ellipsis
     USER: if this is non-zero, then a user-defined type conversion is needed
     B_OR_D: if this is non-zero, then use a base pointer instead of the
             type of the pointer we started with.
     EASY: if this is non-zero, then we have a builtin conversion
           (such as int to long, int to float, etc) to do.

   If two candidates require user-defined type conversions, and the
   type conversions are not identical, then an ambiguity error
   is reported.

   If two candidates agree on user-defined type conversions,
   and one uses pointers of strictly higher type (derived where
   another uses base), then that alternative is silently chosen.

   Note that this technique really only works for 255 arguments.  Perhaps
   this is not enough.  */

     This exists because $4.1 of the ARM states that something like
     `short unsigned int' should promote to `int', not `unsigned int'.
     If, for example, it tries to match two fns, f(int) and f(unsigned),
     f(int) should be a better match than f(unsigned) by this rule.  Without
     this extra metric, they both only appear as "integral promotions", which
     will lead to an ambiguity.
