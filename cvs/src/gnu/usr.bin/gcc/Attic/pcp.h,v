/* Format: */
/* A precompiled file starts with a series of #define and #undef
 statements:
    #define MAC DEF     ---   Indicates MAC must be defined with defn DEF
    #define MAC         ---   Indicates MAC must be defined with any defn
    #undef MAC          ---   Indicates MAC cannot be defined

These preconditions must be true for a precompiled file to be used.  
The preconditions section is null terminated. */

/* Then, there is a four byte number (in network byte order) which */
 /* indicates the number of strings the file contains. */

/* Each string contains a STRINGDEF structure.  The only component of */
 /* the STRINGDEF structure which is used is the lineno field, which */
 /* should hold the line number in the original header file.  */
 /* Then follows the string, followed by a null.  Then comes a four */
 /* byte number (again, in network byte order) indicating the number */
 /* of keys for this string.  Each key is a KEYDEF structure, with */
 /* irrelevant contents, followed by the null-terminated string. */

/* If the number of keys is 0, then there are no keys for the string, */
 /* in other words, the string will never be included.  If the number */
 /* of keys is -1, this is a special flag indicating there are no keys */
 /* in the file, and the string is mandatory (that is, it must be */
 /* included regardless in the included output).  */

/* A file, then, looks like this:

  Precondition 1
  Precondition 2
