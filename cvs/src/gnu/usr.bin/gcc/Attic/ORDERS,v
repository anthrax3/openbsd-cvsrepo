Cygnus Matches Donations!
*************************

To encourage cash donations to the Free Software Foundation, Cygnus Solutions
will continue to contribute corporate funds to the FSF to accompany gifts by
its employees, and by its customers and their employees.

Donations payable to the Free Software Foundation should be sent by eligible
persons to Cygnus Solutions, which will add its gifts and forward the total
to the FSF each quarter.  The FSF will provide the contributor with a receipt
to recognize the contribution (which is tax-deductible on U.S.  tax returns).
To see if your employer is a Cygnus customer, or for more information,
please contact Cygnus:

Free Software Redistributors Donate
***********************************

The French redistributor PACT has agreed to donate $1.00 for each GNU/Linux
CD that they sell.

Red Hat Software has agreed to donate $1.00 to the FSF for every copy of Red
Hat Archives sold.  They have also added a GNU logo to the back of that CD
with the words "Supports the Free Software Foundation".

The SNOW 2.1 CD producers added the words "Includes $5 donation to the FSF"
to the front of their CD.  Potential buyers will know just how much of the
price is for the FSF & how much is for the redistributor.

The Sun Users Group Deutschland has made it even clearer: their CD says,
"Price 90 DM, + 12 DM donation to the FSF." We thank them for their
contribution to our efforts.

Kyoto Micro Computer of Japan regularly gives us 10% of their GNU-related
sales.

Mr. Hiroshi, Mr. Kojima, and the other authors of the `Linux Primer' in Japan
have donated money from the sales of their book.

Infomagic has continued to make sizable donations to the FSF.

At the request of author Arnold Robbins, Specialized Systems Consultants, Inc.
continues to donate 3% of their profits from selling `Effective AWK
Programming'.  We would also like to acknowledge the many SSC authors who
have donated their royalties and fees to the FSF.

In the long run, the success of free software depends on how much new free
software people develop.  Free software distribution offers an opportunity to
raise funds for such development in an ethical way.  These redistributors
have made use of the opportunity.  Many others let it go to waste.

You can help promote free software development by convincing for-a-fee
redistributors to contribute--either by doing development themselves or by
donating to development organizations (the FSF and others).

The way to convince distributors to contribute is to demand and expect this
of them.  This means choosing among distributors partly by how much they give
to free software development.  Then you can show distributors they must
compete to be the one who gives the most.

To make this work, you must insist on numbers that you can compare, such as,
"We will give ten dollars to the Foobar project for each disk sold." A vague
commitment, such as "A portion of the profits is donated," doesn't give you a
basis for comparison.  Even a precise fraction "of the profits from this
disk" is not very meaningful, since creative accounting and unrelated
business decisions can greatly alter what fraction of the sales price counts
as profit.

Also, press developers for firm information about what kind of development
they do or support.  Some kinds make much more long-term difference than
others.  For example, maintaining a separate version of a GNU program
contributes very little; maintaining a program on behalf of the GNU Project
contributes much.  Easy new ports contribute little, since someone else would
surely do them; difficult ports such as adding a new CPU to the GNU compiler
or Mach contribute more; major new features & programs contribute the most.

By establishing the idea that supporting further development is "the proper
thing to do" when distributing free software for a fee, we can assure a
steady flow of resources for making more free software.

 

Help from Free Software Companies
*********************************

When choosing a free software business, ask those you are considering how
much they do to assist free software development, e.g., by contributing money
to free software development or by writing free software improvements
themselves for general use.  By basing your decision partially on this
factor, you can help encourage those who profit from free software to
contribute to its growth.

Wingnut (SRA's special GNU support group) supports the FSF by purchasing
Deluxe Distribution packages on a regular basis.  In this way they transfer
10% of their income to the FSF.  Listing them here is our way of thanking
them.

Major Changes in GNU Software and Documentation
***********************************************

   * Hurd Progress   (Also *note What Is the Hurd::.)

     We have made three test releases of the Hurd, the most recent being 0.2.
     The Hurd is currently much more reliable than previously, and various
     utilities and file system translators, such as an FTP file system, have
     been written that take advantage of the Hurd's unique design.

     One way for people to help out is to compile and run as much third-party
     free software as they can; in this way we can find bugs and deficiencies
     with some rapidity.  Volunteers with a PC are therefore eagerly sought to
     get the 0.2 release and compile their favorite Unix programs and games.

     Daily snapshots of the Hurd sources are now available for those that
     want to see the latest (non-stable) version; see the Hurd page on the
     FSF Web site, `http://www.gnu.ai.mit.edu', for more information.

   * New Source Code CD!   (*note July 1997 Source Code CD-ROMs::.)

     We are releasing the July 1997 (Edition 10) Source Code CD-ROM this
     month.  Once again, it is a two disk set.  It includes several new
     packages: `aegis', `cook', `guavac', `lesstif', `prcs', `rsync', `swarm',
     & `vera'.  On the CD-ROMs are full distributions of X11R6.3,,
     Emacs, GCC, and current versions of all other GNU Software.  *Note GNU
     Software::, for more about these packages.

   * New/Updated Manuals since Last Bulletin   (*note Documentation::.)

     Since the last bulletin, we have published several updated editions of
     our manuals (note the price changes): `GNU Emacs Manual', revised for
     GNU Emacs version 20, now $30; & `Texinfo Manual', for version 3.11 of
     Texinfo, now $25.  We hope to have the following available very soon:
     `GNU Tar manual', first time in print, freshly reorganized and
     rewritten, $20; `GNU Software for MS-Windows and MS-DOS', a book and
     CD-ROM set with a variety of GNU software compiled for MS-DOS and
     Windows 3.1/95/97/NT, $35 ($140 for corporate orders).  Watch our Web
     site, `http://www.gnu.ai.mit.edu', for announcements of these
     publications.

   * Fonts freed

     A free commercial-quality set of the basic 35 Postscript Type 1 fonts is
     now finally available.  The copyright holder of these fonts, URW++
     Design and Development Incorporated, has decided to release them under
     the GPL.  Each font includes `.pfb' (outlines), `.afm' (metrics), and
     `.pfm' (Windows printer metrics) files.  The fonts are compatible with
     Adobe Type Manager and with general Type 1 manipulation tools, as well
     as with Ghostscript and other Postscript language interpreters.

     The fonts are available in `ghostscript-fonts-4.0.tar.gz' on the usual
     FTP sites.

   * DDD now works with LessTif   (Also *note GNU Software::.) Release 2.1.1
     of DDD, the Data Display Debugger, now works with LessTif, a free Motif
     clone.

   * Give to GNU the United Way!

     As a 501(c)3 tax-exempt organization, the FSF is eligible to receive
     United Way funds.  When donating to United Way, one can specify that all
     or part of the donation be directed to the FSF.  On the donor form,
     check the "Specific Requests" box and include the sentence, "Send my
     gift to the Free Software Foundation, 59 Temple Place, Suite 330,
     Boston, MA 02111." We especially appreciate the donations from Microsoft
     matching the United Way donations of their employees.  Also see *Note
     Donations Translate Into Free Software::, and *Note Cygnus Matches
     Donations!::.

   * Tapes and MS-DOS Diskettes No Longer Available from the FSF

     We no longer offer tapes or MS-DOS diskettes due to very low demand.

   * GNU Software Works on MS-DOS   (Also *note GNU Software::.)

     GNU Emacs 19 and many other GNU programs have been ported to MS-DOS for
     i386/i486/Pentium machines.  We ship binaries & sources on the *Note
     Compiler Tools Binaries CD-ROM::.

   * The FSF Takes Discover

     The Free Software Foundation now accepts the Discover card for orders or
     donations.  We also accept the following: Carte Blanche, Diner's Club,
     JCB, MasterCard, Visa, and American Express.  Note that we are charged
     about 5% of an order's total amount in credit card processing fees;
     please consider paying by check instead or adding on a 5% donation to
     make up the difference.  We do *not* recommend that you send credit card
     numbers to us via email, since we have no way of insuring that the
     information will remain confidential.

   * MULE Merge Complete

     MULE is the Multi-Lingual Emacs developed by Ken'ichi Handa at the
     Electrotechnical Lab in Tsukuba, Japan.  This code has been merged into
     Emacs and is included in Emacs 20.

   * GPC, the GNU Pascal Compiler

     The GNU Pascal Compiler (GPC) is part of the GNU compiler family, GNU CC
     or GCC.  It combines a Pascal front end with the proven GNU compiler
     backend for code generation and optimization.  Unlike utilities such as
     p2c, this is a true compiler, not just a converter.

     Version 2.0 of GPC corresponds to GCC version 2.7.2.1.

     The purpose of the GNU Pascal project is to produce a compiler which:
        * combines the clarity of Pascal with powerful tools suitable for
          real-life programming,

        * supports both the Pascal standard and the Extended Pascal standard
          as defined by ISO, ANSI and IEEE.  (ISO 7185:1990, ISO/IEC
          10206:1991, ANSI/IEEE 770X3.160-1989)

        * supports other Pascal standards (UCSD Pascal, Borland Pascal,
          Pascal-SC) in so far as this serves the goal of clarity and
          usability,

        * can generate code for and run on any computer for which the GNU C
          Compiler can generate code and run on.

     The current release (2.0) implements Standard Pascal (ISO 7185, level 0)
     and a large subset of Extended Pascal (ISO 10206) and Borland Pascal.

     The upcoming release 2.1 features better conformance to the various
     Pascal standards, and of course bug fixes.

     A growing group of GPC enthusiasts contributes to the project with code,
     bug reports or fixes.

     `http://agnes.dida.physik.uni-essen.de/~gnu-pascal/', also known as
     `http://home.pages.de/~gnu-pascal/', is the GNU Pascal home page;
     sources may be downloaded from `ftp://kampi.hut.fi/jtv/gnu-pascal/'
     (official) or `ftp://agnes.dida.physik.uni-essen.de/pub/gnu-pascal/'
     (development versions).

   * GUILE

     GUILE 1.2 is released.  GNU's Ubiquitous Intelligent Language for
     Extension is an SCM-based library that can make any ordinary C program
     extensible.  (For SCM info, see "JACAL" in *Note GNU Software::.)
     Nightly snapshots of the development sources are also available, in
     `ftp://ftp.red-bean.com/pub/guile/guile-core-snap.tar.gz'.

     Also being developed are SCSH-compatible system call & Tk interfaces, a
     module system, dynamic linking support, & a byte-code interpreter.
     Support for Emacs Lisp & a more C-like language is coming.

   * A New FSF T-shirt!

     We have a new T-shirt design.  *Note FSF T-shirt::, for the description.

   * New free game

     In August 1995, the action game Abuse by Jonathan Clark was released for
     the first time.  It wasn't free software then--but now, less than two
     years later, the company Crack dot Com has rereleased it as free
     software.  Abuse was initially developed on Linux-based GNU systems, and
     we've included it on our our source CD set.

     Beyond providing the free software community with a game that many
     people enjoy, and code that could be useful for developing other free
     games, this demonstrates an important fact about the economic
     circumstances of computer game development: most non-free games bring
     their profit in a very short period of time.  Therefore, a game company
     can turn a game into free software fairly soon, with little hardship.

     Let's hope that other game developers follow this example.



The Deluxe Distribution
***********************

The Free Software Foundation has been asked repeatedly to create a package
that provides executables for all of our software.  Normally we offer only
sources.  The Deluxe Distribution provides binaries with the source code and
includes six T-shirts, all our CD-ROMs, printed manuals, & reference cards.

The FSF Deluxe Distribution contains the binaries and sources to hundreds of
different programs including Emacs, the GNU C/C++ Compiler, the GNU Debugger,
the complete X Window System, and all the GNU utilities.

We will make a Deluxe Distribution for most machines/operating systems.  We
may be able to send someone to your office to do the compilation, if we can't
find a suitable machine here.  However, we can only compile the programs that
already support your chosen machine/system - porting is a separate matter.
(To commission a port, see the GNU Service Directory; details in *Note Free
Software Support::.) Compiling all these programs takes time; a Deluxe
Distribution for an unusual machine will take longer to produce than one for
a common machine.  Please contact the FSF Office with any questions.

We supply the software on a write-once CD-ROM (in ISO 9660 format with "Rock
Ridge" extensions), or on one of these tapes in Unix `tar' format: 1600 or
6250bpi 1/2in reel, Sun DC300XLP 1/4in cartridge - QIC24, IBM RS/6000 1/4in
c.t. - QIC 150, Exabyte 8mm c.t., or DAT 4mm c.t.  If your computer cannot
read any of these, please contact us to see if we can handle your format.

The manuals included are one each of `Bison', `Calc', `GAWK', `GCC', `GNU C
Library', `GDB', `Flex', `GNU Emacs Lisp Reference', `Programming in Emacs
Lisp: An Introduction', `Make', `Texinfo', & `Termcap' manuals; six copies of
the `GNU Emacs' manual; and ten reference cards each for Emacs, Bison, Calc,
Flex, & GDB.

Every Deluxe Distribution also has a copy of the latest editions of our
CD-ROMs that have sources of our software & compiler tool binaries for some
systems.  The CDs are in ISO 9660 format with Rock Ridge extensions.

The price of the Deluxe Distribution is $5000 (shipping included).  These
sales provide enormous financial assistance to help the FSF develop more free
software.  To order, please fill out the "Deluxe Distribution" section on the

GNU Documentation
*****************

GNU is dedicated to having quality, easy-to-use online & printed
documentation.  GNU manuals are intended to explain underlying concepts,
describe how to use all the features of each program, & give examples of
command use.  GNU manuals are distributed as Texinfo source files, which
yield both typeset hardcopy via the TeX document formatting system and online
hypertext display via the menu-driven Info system.  Source for these manuals
comes with our software; here are the manuals that we publish as printed
books.  *Note Free Software Foundation Order Form::, to order them.

Most GNU manuals are bound as soft cover books with "lay-flat" bindings.
This allows you to open them so they lie flat on a table without creasing the
binding.  They have an inner cloth spine and an outer cardboard cover that
will not break or crease as an ordinary paperback will.  Currently, the
`Using and Porting GNU CC', `GDB', `Emacs', `Emacs Lisp Reference',
`Programming in Emacs Lisp: An Introduction', `GNU Awk User's Guide', `Make',
& `Bison' manuals have this binding.  Our other manuals also lie flat when
opened, using a GBC binding.  Our manuals are 7in by 9.25in except the 8.5in
by 11in `Calc' manual.

The edition number of the manual and version number of the program listed
after each manual's name were current at the time this Bulletin was published.

`Debugging with GDB' (for Version 4.16) tells how to run your program under
GNU Debugger control, examine and alter data, modify a program's flow of
control, and use GDB through GNU Emacs.

The `GNU Emacs Manual' (13th Edition for Version 20) describes editing with
GNU Emacs.  It explains advanced features, including international character
sets; outline mode and regular expression search; how to use special
programming modes to write languages like C++ and TeX; how to use the `tags'
utility; how to compile and correct code; how to make your own keybindings;
and other elementary customizations.

`Programming in Emacs Lisp: An Introduction' (October 1995 Edition 1.04) is
for people who are not necessarily interested in programming, but who do want
to customize or extend their computing environment.  If you read it in Emacs
under Info mode, you can run the sample programs directly.

`The GNU Emacs Lisp Reference Manual' (Edition 2.4 for Version 19.29) and
`The GNU Emacs Lisp Reference, Japanese Edition' (Japanese Draft Revision
1.0, from English Edition 2.4 for Version 19.29) cover this programming
language in depth, including data types, control structures, functions,
macros, syntax tables, searching/matching, modes, windows, keymaps, byte
compilation, and the operating system interface.

`The GNU Awk User's Guide' (Edition 1.0 for Version 3.0) tells how to use
`gawk'.  It is written for those who have never used `awk' and describes
features of this powerful string and record manipulation language.  It
clearly delineates those features which are part of POSIX `awk' from `gawk'
extensions, providing a comprehensive guide to `awk' program portability.

`GNU Make' (Edition 0.51 for Version 3.76 Beta) describes GNU `make', a
program used to rebuild parts of other programs.  The manual tells how to
write "makefiles", which specify how a program is to be compiled and how its
files depend on each other.  Included are an introductory chapter for novice
users and a section about automatically generated dependencies.

The `Flex' manual (Edition 1.03 for Version 2.3.7) teaches you to write a
lexical scanner definition for the `flex' program to create a C++ or C-coded
scanner that recognizes the patterns defined.  You need no prior knowledge of
scanners.

`The Bison Manual' (November 1995 Edition for Version 1.25) teaches you how
to write context-free grammars for the Bison program that convert into
C-coded parsers.  You need no prior knowledge of parser generators.

`Using and Porting GNU CC' (November 1995 Edition for Version 2.7.2) tells
how to run, install, and port the GNU C Compiler to new systems.  It lists
new features and incompatibilities of GCC, but people not familiar with C
will still need a good reference on the C programming language.  It also
covers G++.

The `Texinfo' manual (Edition 2.24 for Version 3) explains the markup
language that produces our online Info documentation & typeset hardcopies.
It tells you how to make tables, lists, chapters, nodes, accented & special
characters, indexes, cross references, & how to catch mistakes.

`The Termcap Manual' (3rd Edition for Version 1.3), often described as "twice
as much as you ever wanted to know about termcap," details the format of the
termcap database, the definitions of terminal capabilities, and the process
of interrogating a terminal description.  This manual is primarily for
programmers.

The `C Library Reference Manual' (Edition 0.08 for Version 2.0) describes the
library's facilities, including both what Unix calls "library functions" &
"system calls."  We are doing small copier runs of this manual until it
becomes more stable.  Please send fixes to `bug-glibc-manual@@prep.ai.mit.edu'.

The `Emacs Calc Manual' (for Version 2.02) is both a tutorial and a reference
manual.  It tells how to do ordinary arithmetic, how to use Calc for algebra,
calculus, and other forms of mathematics, and how to extend Calc.

 

GNU Software
************

All our software is available via FTP; see *Note How to Get GNU Software::.
We also offer *Note CD-ROMs::, and printed *Note Documentation::, which
includes manuals and reference cards.  In the articles describing the
contents of each medium, the version number listed after each program name
was current when we published this Bulletin.  When you order a newer CD-ROM,
some of the programs may be newer and therefore the version number higher.
*Note Free Software Foundation Order Form::, for ordering information.

Some of the contents of our FTP distributions are compressed.  We have
software on our FTP sites to uncompress these files.  Due to patent troubles
with `compress', we use another compression program, `gzip'.

You may need to build GNU `make' before you build our other software.  Some
vendors supply no `make' utility at all and some native `make' programs lack
the `VPATH' feature essential for using the GNU configure system to its full
extent.  The GNU `make' sources have a shell script to build `make' itself on
such systems.

We welcome all bug reports and enhancements sent to the appropriate
electronic mailing list (*note Free Software Support::.).

 

Configuring GNU Software
------------------------

We are using Autoconf, a uniform scheme for configuring GNU software packages
in order to compile them (see "Autoconf" and "Automake" below, in this
article).  The goal is to have all GNU software support the same alternatives
for naming machine and system types.

Ultimately, it will be possible to configure and build the entire system all
at once, eliminating the need to configure each individual package separately.

You can also specify both the host and target system to build
cross-compilation tools.  Most GNU programs now use Autoconf-generated
configure scripts.

 

GNU Software Now Available
--------------------------

For future programs and features, see *Note Forthcoming GNUs::.

Key to cross reference:

        BinCD        January 1997 Binaries CD-ROM
        SrcCD        July 1997 Source CD-ROMs

[FSFman] shows that we sell a manual for that package.  [FSFrc] shows we sell
a reference card for that package.  To order them, *Note Free Software
Foundation Order Form::.  *Note Documentation::, for more information on the
manuals.  Source code for each manual or reference card is included with each
package.

   * `abuse'   *Also *note GNUs Flashes::.*   (SrcCD)

     The recently-freed program `abuse' is a dark, side-scrolling game with
     Robotron-esque controls: you control your movement with the keyboard and
     fire & aim with the mouse.  You can get more info at
     `http://crack.com/games/abuse'.

   * acct   (SrcCD)

     acct is a system accounting package.  It includes the programs `ac'
     (summarize login accounting), `accton' (turn accounting on or off),
     `last' (show who has logged in recently), `lastcomm' (show which
     commands have been used), `sa' (summarize process accounting),
     `dump-utmp' (print a `utmp' file in human-readable format), &
     `dump-acct' (print an `acct' or `pacct' file in human-readable format).

   * `acm'   (SrcCD)

     `acm' is a LAN-oriented, multiplayer, aerial combat simulation that runs
     under the X Window System.  Players engage in air to air combat against
     one another using heat seeking missiles and cannons.  We are working on
     a more accurate simulation of real airplane flight characteristics.

   * aegis   (SrcCD)

     Aegis is a transaction-based software configuration management system.
     It provides a framework within which a team of developers may work on
     many changes to a program concurrently, and Aegis coordinates
     integrating these changes back into the master source of the program,
     with as little disruption as possible.

   * Apache   *Also see* `http://www.apache.org/'   (SrcCD)

     Apache is an HTTP server designed as a successor to the NCSA family of
     Web servers.  It adds a significant amount of new functionality, has an
     extensive API for modular enhancements, is extremely flexible without
     compromising speed, and has an active development group and user
     community.

   * Autoconf   (SrcCD)

     Autoconf produces shell scripts which automatically configure source code
     packages.  These scripts adapt the packages to many kinds of Unix-like
     systems without manual user intervention.  Autoconf creates a script for
     a package from a template file which lists the operating system features
     which the package can use, in the form of `m4' macro calls.  Autoconf
     requires GNU `m4' to operate, but the resulting configure scripts it
     generates do not.

   * Automake   (SrcCD)

     Automake is a tool for generating `Makefile.in' files for use with
     Autoconf.  The generated makefiles are compliant with GNU Makefile
     standards.

   * BASH   (SrcCD)

     GNU's shell, BASH (Bourne Again SHell), is compatible with the Unix `sh'
     and offers many extensions found in `csh' and `ksh'.  BASH has job
     control, `csh'-style command history, command-line editing (with Emacs
     and `vi' modes built-in), and the ability to rebind keys via the
     `readline' library.  BASH conforms to the POSIX 1003.2-1992 standard.

   * bc   (SrcCD)

     `bc' is an interactive algebraic language with arbitrary precision
     numbers.  GNU `bc' follows the POSIX 1003.2-1992 standard with several
     extensions, including multi-character variable names, an `else'
     statement, and full Boolean expressions.  The RPN calculator `dc' is now
     distributed as part of the same package, but GNU `bc' is not implemented
     as a `dc' preprocessor.

   * BFD   (BinCD, SrcCD)

     The Binary File Descriptor library allows a program which operates on
     object files (e.g., `ld' or GDB) to support many different formats in a
     clean way.  BFD provides a portable interface, so that only BFD needs to
     know the details of a particular format.  One result is that all
     programs using BFD will support formats such as a.out, COFF, and ELF.
     BFD comes with Texinfo source for a manual (not yet published on paper).

     At present, BFD is not distributed separately; it is included with
     packages that use it.

   * Binutils   (BinCD, SrcCD)

     Binutils includes these programs: `addr2line', `ar', `c++filt', `gas',
     `gprof', `ld', `nm', `objcopy', `objdump', `ranlib', `size', `strings', &
     `strip'.

     Binutils version 2 uses the BFD library.  The GNU assembler, `gas',
     supports the a29k, Alpha, ARM, D10V, H8/300, H8/500, HP-PA, i386, i960,
     M32R, m68k, m88k, MIPS, Matsushita 10200 and 10300, NS32K, PowerPC,
     RS/6000, SH, SPARC, Tahoe, Vax, and Z8000 CPUs, and attempts to be
     compatible with many other assemblers for Unix and embedded systems.  It
     can produce mixed C and assembly listings, and includes a macro facility
     similar to that in some other assemblers.  GNU's linker, `ld', supports
     shared libraries on many systems, emits source-line numbered error
     messages for multiply-defined symbols and undefined references, and
     interprets a superset of AT&T's Linker Command Language, which gives
     control over where segments are placed in memory.  `objdump' can
     disassemble code for most of the CPUs listed above, and can display
     other data (e.g., symbols and relocations) from any file format read by
     BFD.

   * Bison   (BinCD, SrcCD)   [FSFman, FSFrc]

     Bison is an upwardly compatible replacement for the parser generator
     `yacc'.  Texinfo source for the `Bison Manual' and reference card are
     included.

   * C Library (`glibc')   (BinCD, SrcCD)   [FSFman]

     The GNU C library supports ISO C-1989, ISO C/amendment 1-1995, POSIX
     1003.1-1990, POSIX 1003.1b-1993, POSIX 1003.1c-1995 (when the underlying
     system permits), & most of the functions in POSIX 1003.2-1992.  It is
     nearly compliant with the extended XPG4.2 specification which guarantees
     upward compatibility with 4.4BSD & many System V functions.

     When used with the GNU Hurd, the C Library performs many functions of the
     Unix system calls directly.  Mike Haertel has written a fast `malloc'
     which wastes less memory than the old GNU version.

     GNU `stdio' lets you define new kinds of streams, just by writing a few
     C functions.  Two methods for handling translated messages help writing
     internationalized programs & the user can adopt the environment the
     program runs in to conform with local conventions.  Extended `getopt'
     functions are already used to parse options, including long options, in
     many GNU utilities.  The name lookup functions now are modularized which
     makes it easier to select the service which is needed for the specific
     database & the document interface makes it easy to add new services.
     Texinfo source for the `GNU C Library Reference Manual' is included
     (*note Documentation::.).

     Previous versions of the GNU C library ran on a large number of systems.
     The architecture-dependent parts of the C library have not been updated
     since development on version 2.0 started, so today it runs out of the
     box only on GNU/Hurd (all platforms GNU/Hurd also runs on) & GNU/Linux
     (ix86, Alpha, m68k, MIPS, Sparc, PowerPC; work is in progress for ARM).
     Other architectures will become available again as soon as somebody does
     the port.

   * C++ Library (`libg++')   (BinCD, SrcCD)

     The GNU C++ library (traditionally called `libg++') includes libstdc++,
     which implements the library facilities defined by the forthcoming ISO
     C++ standard.  This includes strings, iostream, and various container
     classes.  All of this is templatized.

     The package also contains the older libg++ library for backward
     compatibility, but new programs should avoid using it.

   * Calc   (SrcCD)   [FSFman, FSFrc]

     Calc (written by Dave Gillespie in Emacs Lisp) is an extensible, advanced
     desk calculator & mathematical tool that runs as part of GNU Emacs.  You
     can use Calc as a simple four-function calculator, but it has many more
     features including: choice of algebraic or RPN (stack-based) entry;
     logarithmic, trigonometric, & financial functions; arbitrary precision;
     complex numbers; vectors; matrices; dates; times; infinities; sets;
     algebraic simplification; & differentiation & integration.  It outputs
     to `gnuplot', & comes with source for a manual & reference card (*note
     Documentation::.).

   * `cfengine'   (SrcCD)

     `cfengine' is used to maintain site-wide configuration of a
     heterogeneous Unix network using a simple high level language.  Its
     appearance is similar to `rdist', but allows many more operations to be
     performed automatically.  See Mark Burgess, "A Site Configuration
     Engine", `Computing Systems', Vol. 8, No. 3 (ask `office@@usenix.org' how
     to get a copy).

   * Chess   (SrcCD)

     GNU Chess enables you to play a game of chess with a computer instead of
     a person.  It is useful to practice with when there are significant
     spare cpu cycles and a real person is unavailable.

     The program offers a plain terminal interface, one using curses, and a
     reasonable X Windows interface `xboard'.  Best results are obtained by
     compiling with GNU C.

     Improvements this past year are in the Windows-compatible version,
     mostly bugfixes.

     Stuart Cracraft started the GNU mascot back in the mid-1980's.  John
     Stanback (and innumerable contributors) are responsible for GNU's brain
     development and its fair play.  Acknowledgements for the past year's
     work are due Conor McCarthy.

   * CLISP   (SrcCD)

     CLISP is a Common Lisp implementation by Bruno Haible & Michael Stoll.
     It mostly supports the Lisp described by `Common LISP: The Language (2nd
     edition)' & the ANSI Common Lisp standard.  CLISP includes an
     interpreter, a byte-compiler, a large subset of CLOS & a foreign language
     interface.  The user interface language (English, German, French) can be
     chosen at run time.  An X11 API is available through CLX & Garnet.
     CLISP needs only 2 MB of memory & runs on all kinds of Unix systems & on
     many microcomputers (including MS-DOS systems, OS/2, Windows NT, Windows
     95, Amiga 500-4000, & Acorn RISC PC).  See also item "Common Lisp",
     which describes GCL, a complete Common Lisp implementation with compiler.

   * CLX   (SrcCD)

     CLX is an X Window interface library for GCL.  This is separate from the
     built-in TK interface.

   * Common Lisp (`gcl')   (SrcCD)

     GNU Common Lisp (GCL, formerly known as Kyoto Common Lisp) is a compiler
     & interpreter for Common Lisp.  GCL is very portable & extremely
     efficient on a wide class of applications, & compares favorably in
     performance with commercial Lisps on several large theorem-prover &
     symbolic algebra systems.  GCL supports the CLtL1 specification but is
     moving towards the proposed ANSI standard.

     GCL compiles to C & then uses the native optimizing C compiler (e.g.,
     GCC).  A function with a fixed number of args & one value turns into a C
     function of the same number of args, returning one value--so GCL is
     maximally efficient on such calls.  Its conservative garbage collector
     gives great freedom to the C compiler to put Lisp values in registers.
     It has a source level Lisp debugger for interpreted code & displays
     source code in an Emacs window.  Its profiler (based on the C profiling
     tools) counts function calls & the time spent in each function.

     There is now a built-in interface to the Tk widget system.  It runs in a
     separate process, so users may monitor progress on Lisp computations or
     interact with running computations via a windowing interface.

     There is also an Xlib interface via C (xgcl-2).  CLX runs with GCL, as
     does PCL (see "PCL" later in this article).

     GCL version 2.2.2 is released under the GNU Library General Public
     License.

   * cook   (SrcCD)

     Cook is a tool for constructing files, and maintaining referential
     integrity between files.  It is given a set of files to create, and
     recipes of how to create and maintain them.  In any non-trivial program
     there will be prerequisites to performing the actions necessary to
     creating any file, such as include files.  The `cook' program provides a
     mechanism to define these.

     Some features which distinguish Cook include a strong procedural
     description language, and fingerprints to supplement file modification
     time stamps.  There is also a `make2cook' utility included to ease
     transition.

   * `cpio'   (SrcCD)

     `cpio' is an archive program with all the features of SVR4 `cpio',
     including support for the final POSIX 1003.1 `ustar' standard.  `mt', a
     program to position magnetic tapes, is included with `cpio'.

   * CVS   (SrcCD)

     CVS is a version control system (like RCS or SCCS) which allows you to
     keep old versions of files (usually source code), keep a log of who,
     when, and why changes occurred, etc.  It handles multiple developers,
     multiple directories, triggers to enable/log/control various operations,
     and can work over a wide area network.  It does not handle build
     management or bug-tracking; these are handled by `make' and GNATS,
     respectively.

   * `cxref'   (SrcCD)

     `cxref' is a program that will produce documentation (in LaTeX or HTML)
     including cross-references from C program source code.  It has been
     designed to work with ANSI C, incorporating K&R, and most popular GNU
     extensions.  The documentation for the subject program is produced from
     comments in the code that are appropriately formatted.  The cross
     referencing comes from the code itself and requires no extra work.

   * DDD   (SrcCD)

     The Data Display Debugger (DDD) is a common graphical user interface to
     GDB, DBX, and XDB, the popular Unix debuggers.  DDD provides a graphical
     data display where complex data structures can be explored incrementally
     and interactively.  DDD has been designed to compete with well-known
     commercial debuggers; as of release 2.1.1, DDD also compiles and runs
     with LessTif, a free Motif clone, without loss of functionality.  For
     more details, see the DDD WWW page at
     `http://www.cs.tu-bs.de/softech/ddd/'.

   * DejaGnu   (SrcCD)

     DejaGnu is a framework to test programs with a single front end for all
     tests.  DejaGnu's flexibility & consistency makes it easy to write tests.
     DejaGnu will also work with remote hosts and embedded systems.

     DejaGnu comes with `expect', which runs scripts to conduct dialogs with
     programs.

   * Diffutils   (SrcCD)

     GNU `diff' compares files showing line-by-line changes in several
     flexible formats.  It is much faster than traditional Unix versions.  The
     Diffutils package has `diff', `diff3', `sdiff', & `cmp'.  Future plans
     include support for internationalization (e.g., error messages in
     Chinese) & some non-Unix PC environments, & a library interface that can
     be used by other free software.

   * DJGPP   *Also see "GCC" below*   (BinCD)

     DJ Delorie has ported GCC/G++ to i386s running DOS.  DJGPP has a 32-bit
     i386 DOS extender with a symbolic debugger, development libraries, &
     ports of Bison, `flex', & Binutils.  Full source code is provided.  It
     needs at least 5MB of hard disk space to install & 512K of RAM to use.
     It supports SVGA (up to 1024x768), XMS & VDISK memory allocation,
     `himem.sys', VCPI (e.g., QEMM, DESQview, & 386MAX), & DPMI (e.g.,
     Windows 3.x, OS/2, QEMM, & QDPMI).  Version 2 was released in Feb. 1996,
     & needs a DPMI environment; a free DPMI server is included.

     `/pub/simtelnet/gnu/djgpp/' (or a SimTel mirror site).

     Ask `listserv@@delorie.com', to join a DJGPP users mailing list.

   * `dld'   (SrcCD)

     `dld' is a dynamic linker written by W. Wilson Ho.  Linking your program
     with the `dld' library allows you to dynamically load object files into
     the running binary.  `dld' supports a.out object types on the following
     platforms: Convex C-Series (BSD), i386/i486/Pentium (GNU/Linux), Sequent
     Symmetry i386 (Dynix 3), Sun-3 (SunOS 3 & 4), Sun-4 (SunOS 4), & VAX
     (Ultrix).

   * `doschk'   (SrcCD)

     This program is a utility to help software developers ensure that their
     source file names are distinguishable on System V platforms with
     14-character filenames and on MS-DOS systems with 8+3 character
     filenames.

   * `ed'   (SrcCD)

     `ed' is the standard text editor.  It is line-oriented and can be used
     interactively or in scripts.

   * Elib   (SrcCD)

     Elib is a small library of Emacs Lisp functions, including routines for
     using AVL trees and doubly-linked lists.

   * Elisp archive   (SrcCD)

     This is a snapshot of Ohio State's GNU Emacs Lisp FTP Archive.  FTP it
     from `archive.cis.ohio-state.edu' in `/pub/gnu/emacs/elisp-archive'.

   * Emacs   *Also *note GNUs Flashes::.*   [FSFman(s), FSFrc]

     In 1975, Richard Stallman developed the first Emacs, an extensible,
     customizable real-time display editor & computing environment.  GNU Emacs
     is his second implementation.  It offers true Lisp--smoothly integrated
     into the editor--for writing extensions & provides an interface to the X
     Window System.  It runs on Unix, MS-DOS, & Windows NT or 95.  In
     addition to its powerful native command set, Emacs can emulate the
     editors vi & EDT (DEC's VMS editor).  Emacs has many other features which
     make it a full computing support environment.  Source for the `GNU Emacs
     Manual' & a reference card comes with the software.  Sources for the
     `GNU Emacs Lisp Reference Manual', & `Programming in Emacs Lisp: An
     Introduction' are distributed in separate packages.  *Note
     Documentation::.

   * Emacs 20   (SrcCD)   [FSFman(s), FSFrc]

     Emacs 20.1 was just released recently.  Its main new features include
     support for many languages and many character codes (the MULE facility)
     and a new convenient customization feature.  The text-filling commands
     handle indented and bulleted paragraphs conveniently; there are new help
     facilities for looking up documentation about functions and symbols in
     various languages.  A new method of file-locking works even when using
     NFS.  Some dired commands have been made more systematic.

     We believe Emacs 20 operates on the same systems as Emacs 19, but we do
     not have confirmation for all of them.

   * Emacs 19   (SrcCD)   [FSFman(s), FSFrc]

     Emacs 19 works with character-only terminals & with the X Window System
     (with or without an X toolkit).  It also runs on MS-DOS, MS Windows, and
     with multiple-window support on MS Windows 95/NT.

     Emacs 19 works on: Acorn RISC (RISCiX); Alliant FX/2800 (BSD); Alpha
     (OSF/1 or GNU/Linux); Apollo (DomainOS); Bull DPX/2 2nn & 3nn (SysV.3) &
     sps7 (SysV.2); Clipper; Convex (BSD); Cubix QBx (SysV); Data General
     Aviion (DGUX); DEC MIPS (Ultrix 4.2, OSF/1, not VMS); Elxsi 6400 (SysV);

     HP-UX 7, 8, 9; NextStep); Intel i386/i486/Pentium (GNU/Hurd, GNU/Linux,
     386BSD, AIX, BSDI/386, FreeBSD, Esix, ISC, MS-DOS, NetBSD, SCO3.2v4,
     Solaris, SysV, Xenix, WindowsNT, Windows95); IBM RS/6000 (AIX 3.2) &
     RT/PC (AIX, BSD); Motorola Delta 147 & 187 (SysV.3, SysV.4, m88kbcs);

   * Emacs 18   (SrcCD)   [FSFrc]

     Emacs 18 is several years old.  We no longer maintain it, but still
     distribute it for those using platforms which Emacs 19 does not support.

   * `enscript'   (SrcCD)

     `enscript' is an upwardly-compatible replacement for the Adobe
     `enscript' program.  It formats ASCII files (outputting in Postscript)
     and stores generated output to a file or sends it directly to the
     printer.

   * `es'   (SrcCD)

     `es' is an extensible shell (based on `rc') with first-class functions,
     lexical scope, exceptions, and rich return values (i.e., functions can
     return values other than just numbers).  `es''s extensibility comes from
     the ability to modify and extend the shell's built-in services, such as
     path searching and redirection.  Like `rc', it is great for both
     interactive use and scripting, particularly since its quoting rules are
     much less baroque than the C and Bourne shells.

   * Exim   (SrcCD)

     Exim is a new Internet mail transfer agent, similar in style to Smail 3.
     It can handle relatively high volume mail systems, header rewriting,
     control over which hosts/nets may use it as a relay, blocking of
     unwanted mail from specified hosts/nets/senders, and multiple local
     domains on one mail host ("virtual domains") with several options for
     the way these are handled.

   * `f2c'   *Also see "Fortran" below & in *Note Forthcoming GNUs::.*  
     (SrcCD)

     `f2c' converts Fortran-77 source into C or C++, which can be compiled
     with GCC or G++.  Get bug fixes by FTP from site `netlib.bell-labs.com'
     or by email from `netlib@@netlib.bell-labs.com'.  For a summary, see the
     file `/netlib/f2c/readme.gz'.

   * `ffcall'   (SrcCD)

     `ffcall' is a C library for implementing foreign function calls in

   * Findutils   (SrcCD)

     `find' is frequently used both interactively and in shell scripts to
     find files which match certain criteria and perform arbitrary operations
     on them.  Also included are `locate', which scans a database for file
     names that match a pattern, and `xargs', which applies a command to a
     list of files.

   * Finger   (SrcCD)

     GNU Finger has more features than other finger programs.  For sites with
     many hosts, a single host may be designated as the finger "server" host
     and other hosts at that site configured as finger "clients".  The server
     host collects information about who is logged in on the clients.  To
     finger a user at a GNU Finger site, a query to any of its client hosts
     gets useful information.  GNU Finger supports many customization
     features, including user output filters and site-programmable output for
     special target names.

   * `flex'   (BinCD, SrcCD)   [FSFman, FSFrc]

     `flex' is a replacement for the `lex' scanner generator.  `flex' was
     written by Vern Paxson of the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory and generates
     far more efficient scanners than `lex' does.  Sources for the `Flex
     Manual' and reference card are included (*note Documentation::.).

   * Fontutils   (SrcCD)

     The Fontutils convert between font formats, create fonts for use with

   * `gcal'   (SrcCD)

     `gcal' is a program for printing calendars.  It displays different
     styled calendar sheets, eternal holiday lists, and fixed date warning
     lists.

   * GCC   (BinCD, SrcCD)   [FSFman]

     Version 2 of the GNU C Compiler supports the languages C, C++, and
     Objective-C; the source file name suffix or a compiler option selects
     the language.  (Also see "GNAT" later in this article for Ada language
     supports.) Objective-C support was donated by NeXT.  The runtime support
     needed to run Objective-C programs is now distributed with GCC.  (This
     does not include any Objective-C classes aside from `object', but see
     "GNUstep" in *Note Forthcoming GNUs::.) G++ seeks to be compliant with
     the ANSI C++ language standard.  See
     `http://www.cygnus.com/misc/wp/index.html' for the latest draft.

     GCC is a fairly portable optimizing compiler which performs many
     optimizations.  They include: automatic register allocation, common
     sub-expression elimination (CSE) (including a certain amount of CSE
     between basic blocks - though not all the supported machine descriptions
     provide for scheduling or delay slots), invariant code motion from
     loops, induction variable optimizations, constant propagation, copy
     propagation, delayed popping of function call arguments, tail recursion
     elimination, integration of inline functions & frame pointer elimination,
     instruction scheduling, loop unrolling, filling of delay slots, leaf
     function optimization, optimized multiplication by constants, the
     ability to assign attributes to instructions, & many local optimizations
     automatically deduced from the machine description.

     GCC can open-code most arithmetic on 64-bit values (type `long long
     int').  It supports extended floating point (type `long double') on the
     68k; other machines will follow.  GCC supports full ANSI C, traditional
     C, & GNU C extensions (including: nested functions support, nonlocal
     gotos, & taking the address of a label).

     GCC can generate a.out, COFF, ELF, & OSF-Rose files when used with a
     suitable assembler.  It can produce debugging information in these
     formats: BSD stabs, COFF, ECOFF, ECOFF with stabs, & DWARF.

     GCC generates code for many CPUs, including the a29k, Alpha, ARM, AT&T,
     DSP1610, Clipper, Convex cN, Elxsi, Fujitsu Gmicro, i370, i860, i960,
     MIL-STD-1750a, MIPS, ns32k, PDP-11, Pyramid, ROMP, RS/6000, SH, SPUR,
     Tahoe, VAX, & we32k.

     Position-independent code is generated for the Clipper, Hitachi H8/300,
     HP-PA (1.0 & 1.1), i386/i486/Pentium, m68k, m88k, SPARC, & SPARClite.

     Operating systems supported include: GNU/Hurd, GNU/Linux, ACIS, AIX, AOS,
     BSD, Clix, Concentrix, Ctix, DG/UX, Dynix, FreeBSD, Genix, HP-UX, Irix,
     ISC, Luna, LynxOS, Minix, NetBSD, NewsOS, NeXTStep, OS/2, OSF, OSF-Rose,
     RISCOS, SCO, Solaris 2, SunOS 4, System/370, SysV, Ultrix, Unos, VMS, &
     Windows/NT.

     Using the configuration scheme for GCC, building a cross-compiler is as
     easy as building a native compiler.

     Texinfo source for the `Using and Porting GNU CC' manual is included
     with GCC (*note Documentation::.).

   * GDB   (BinCD, SrcCD)   [FSFman, FSFrc]

     GDB, the GNU DeBugger, is a source-level debugger for C, C++, & Fortran.
     It provides partial support for Modula-2 & Chill.

     GDB can debug both C & C++, & will work with executables made by many
     different compilers; but, C++ debugging will have some limitations if
     you do not use GCC.

     GDB has a command line user interface, and Emacs has GDB mode as an
     interface.  Two X interfaces (not distributed or maintained by the FSF)
     are: `gdbtk' (FTP it from `ftp.cygnus.com' in directory `/pub/gdb'); and
     `xxgdb' (FTP it from `ftp.x.org' in directory `/contrib/utilities').

     Executable files and symbol tables are read via the BFD library, which
     allows a single copy of GDB to debug programs with multiple object file
     formats (e.g., a.out, COFF, ELF).  Other features include a rich command
     language, remote debugging over serial lines or TCP/IP, and watchpoints
     (breakpoints triggered when the value of an expression changes).

     GDB uses a standard remote interface to a simulator library which
     includes simulators for the ARM, Hitachi H8/300, Hitachi SH, & PowerPC.

     GDB can perform cross-debugging.  To say that GDB "targets" a platform
     means it can perform native or cross-debugging for it.  To say that GDB
     can "host" a given platform means that it can be built on it, but cannot
     necessarily debug native programs.

     GDB can:

        * "target" & "host": Amiga 3000 (AmigaOS, Amix, NetBSD), DEC Alpha
          (OSF/1), DECstation 3100 & 5000 (Ultrix), HP 9000/300 (BSD, HP-UX),

     the high end, symmetric multiprocessing servers that are currently on the
     market.  It is available for many more Unix variants than any other
     comparable product, and inter-operates with other NQS systems, including
     Cray's NQE.

   * `geomview'   *See* `http://www.geom.umn.edu/software/geomview'   (SrcCD)

     `geomview' is an interactive geometry viewing program, for Unix systems
     with Motif, using X, GL, or OpenGL graphics.  It allows multiple
     independently controllable objects and cameras.  External programs may
     drive desired aspects of the viewer, e.g. loading changing geometry or
     controlling motion, while allowing interactive mouse-and-GUI control of
     everything else.  Controllable features include motion, appearance
     (wireframe, shading, lighting and material properties), mouse-based
     selection, snapshoting (PPM or SGI image, Postscript, and RenderMan
     formats), display in hyperbolic and spherical spaces, and projection
     from higher dimensions.  Includes converters to display Mathematica and
     Maple 3-D graphics, and limited conversion to/from VRML.

   * `gettext'   *Also *note Help the Translation Project::.*   (SrcCD)

     The GNU `gettext' tool set has everything maintainers need to

     Level 2 interpreter and a PDF 1.1 interpreter (except for encryption).
     Significant new features include the ability to convert PDF to
     Postscript.

     Ghostscript executes commands in the Postscript and PDF languages by
     writing directly to a printer, drawing on an X window, or writing to
     files for printing later or manipulating with other graphics programs.

     Ghostscript includes a C-callable graphics library (for client programs
     that do not want to deal with the Postscript language).  It also runs on
     MS-DOS, MS Windows, OS/2, OpenVMS, and Mac OS (native on both 68K and
     PowerPC) (but please do *not* ask the FSF staff any questions about this;
     we do not use these operating systems).

   * Ghostview   (SrcCD)

     Tim Theisen, `ghostview@@cs.wisc.edu', created Ghostview, a previewer for
     multi-page files with an X Window interface.  Ghostview & Ghostscript

   * `mkisofs'   (SrcCD)

     `mkisofs' is a pre-mastering program to generate an ISO 9660 file system.
     It takes a snapshot of a directory tree, and makes a binary image which
     corresponds to an ISO 9660 file system when written to a block device.

     It can also generate the System Use Sharing Protocol records of the Rock
     Ridge Interchange Protocol (used to further describe the files in an ISO
     9660 file system to a Unix host; it provides information such as longer
     filenames, uid/gid, permissions, and device nodes).

     The `mkisofs' program is often used with `cdwrite'.  The `cdwrite'
     program works by taking the image that `mkisofs' generates and driving a
     cdwriter drive to actually burn the disk.  `cdwrite' works under
     GNU/Linux, and supports popular cdwriter drives.  Older versions of
     `cdwrite' were included with older versions of `mkisofs';
     `sunsite.unc.edu' has the latest version:
     `/pub/Linux/utils/disk-management/cdwrite-2.0.tar.gz'.

   * `mtools'   (SrcCD)

     `mtools' is a collection of utilities to access MS-DOS disks from Unix
     without mounting them.  It supports Windows 95 style long file names,
     OS/2 Xdf disks, ZIP/JAZ disks and 2m disks (store up to 1992k on a high
     density 3 1/2 disk).

     integrate a system of ordinary differential equations.

   * PRCS   (SrcCD)

     PRCS, the Project Revision Control System, is a version control program
     with purpose similar to that of CVS.  It was designed with simplicity in
     mind.  Like CVS, PRCS uses RCS to accomplish this task, but this is
     inconsequential to the user, as RCS is completely hidden beneath a layer
     of abstraction.

   * `ptx'   (SrcCD)

     GNU `ptx' is our version of the traditional permuted index generator.
     It handles multiple input files at once, has TeX compatible output, &
     outputs readable "KWIC" (KeyWords In Context) indexes without using
     `nroff'.  Plans are to merge this package into `textutils'.

     It does not yet handle input files that do not fit in memory all at once.

   * `rc'   (SrcCD)

     `rc' is a shell that features a C-like syntax (much more so than `csh')
     and far cleaner quoting rules than the C or Bourne shells.  It's
     intended to be used interactively, but is also great for writing
     scripts.  It inspired the shell `es'.

   * RCS   (SrcCD)

     RCS, the Revision Control System, is used for version control &
     management of software projects.  Used with GNU `diff', RCS can handle
     binary files (8-bit data, executables, object files, etc).  RCS now
     conforms to GNU configuration standards & to POSIX 1003.1b-1993.  Also
     see the CVS item above.

   * `readline'   (BinCD, SrcCD)

     Brian Fox wrote the `readline' library one weekend in 1987, so that the
     FSF would have a clean Emacs-like line editing facility that could be
     used across multiple programs.  After installing it in Bash, he went on
     to test the reusability of the code by adding it to GDB, and then later,
     to the GNU FTP client.  The library supplies many entry points--the
     simplest interface gives any program the ability to store a history of
     input lines, and gives the end user a complete Emacs-like (or vi-like)
     editing capability over the input, simply by replacing calls to `gets'
     with calls to `readline'.

   * `recode'   *Also *note Forthcoming GNUs::.*   (SrcCD)

     GNU `recode' converts files between character sets and usages.  When
     exact transliterations are not possible, it may delete the offending
     characters or fall back on approximations.  This program recognizes or
     outputs nearly 150 different character sets and is able to transliterate
     files between almost any pair.  Most RFC 1345 character sets are
     supported.

   * `regex'   (SrcCD)

     The GNU regular expression library supports POSIX.2, except for
     internationalization features.  It is included in many GNU programs which
     do regular expression matching & is available separately.  An alternate
     regular expression package, `rx', is faster than `regex' in many cases;
     we were planning to replace `regex' with `rx', but it is not certain
     this will happen.

   * Roxen   (SrcCD)

     Roxen is a modularized, object-oriented, non-forking World Wide Web
     server with high performance and throughput, and capabilities for on the
     fly image generation (`http://www.roxen.com').  It was formerly named
     Spinner, but was renamed for trademark reasons.

   * `rsync'   (SrcCD)

     `rsync' is a replacement for `rcp' that has many more features.  `rsync'
     uses the "rsync algorithm", which provides a very fast method for
     synchronizing large remote files, sending only the differences across
     the link.  It does not require both versions of a file to be local in
     order to compute the differences.  A technical report describing the
     rsync algorithm is included with the package.

   * `rx'   (SrcCD)

     Tom Lord has written `rx', a new regular expression library which is
     generally faster and more correct than the older GNU `regex' library.

   * SAOimage   (SrcCD)

     SAOimage is an X-based astronomical image viewer.  It reads array data
     images, which may be in specific formats, and displays them with a
     pseudocolor colormap.  There is full interactive control of the
     colormap, panning and zooming, graphical annotation, and cursor tracking
     in pixel and sky coordinates, among other features.

   * `screen'   (SrcCD)

     `screen' is a terminal multiplexer that runs several separate "screens"
     (ttys) on a single character-based terminal.  Each virtual terminal
     emulates a DEC VT100 plus several ISO 2022 and ISO 6429 (ECMA 48, ANSI
     X3.64) functions, including color.  Arbitrary keyboard input translation
     is also supported.  `screen' sessions can be detached and resumed later
     on a different terminal type.  Output in detached sessions is saved for
     later viewing.

   * `sed'   (SrcCD)

     `sed' is a stream-oriented version of `ed'.  It comes with the `rx'
     library.

   * Sharutils   (SrcCD)

     `shar' makes so-called shell archives out of many files, preparing them
     for transmission by electronic mail services; `unshar' helps unpack
     these shell archives after reception.  `uuencode' and `uudecode' are
     POSIX compliant implementations of a pair of programs which transform
     files into a format that can be safely transmitted across a 7-bit ASCII
     link.

   * Shellutils   (SrcCD)

     The Shellutils are: `basename', `chroot', `date', `dirname', `echo',
     `env', `expr', `factor', `false', `groups', `hostname', `id', `logname',

     `who', `whoami', & `yes'.

   * Shogi   (SrcCD)

     Shogi is a Japanese game similar to Chess; a major difference is that
     captured pieces can be returned into play.

     GNU Shogi is a variant of GNU Chess; it implements the same features &
     similar heuristics.  As a new feature, sequences of partial board
     patterns can be introduced to help the program play toward specific
     opening patterns.  It has both character and X display interfaces.

     It is primarily supported by Matthias Mutz on behalf of the FSF.

   * SIPP   (SrcCD)

     SIPP is a library for photorealistically rendering 3D scenes.  Scenes can
     be illuminated by an arbitrary number of light sources; they are built up
     of object hierarchies, with arbitrarily many subobjects and subsurfaces.
     Surfaces can be rendered with either Phong, Gouraud, or flat shading.
     The library supports programmable shaders and texture mapping.

   * Smail   (SrcCD)

     Smail is a mail transport system, designed as a compatible drop-in
     replacement for `sendmail'.  It uses a much simpler configuration format
     than `sendmail' and is designed to be setup with minimal effort.

     GNU Smalltalk is an interpreted object-oriented programming language
     system written in highly portable C.  It has been ported to MS-DOS, many
     Unixes, & other OSes.  Features include a binary image save capability,
     the ability to call user-written C code with parameters, an Emacs
     editing mode, a version of the X protocol invocable from Smalltalk,
     optional byte-code compilation and/or execution tracing, & automatically
     loaded per-user initialization files.  It implements all of the classes
     & protocol in the book "Smalltalk-80: The Language", except for the
     graphic user interface (GUI) related classes.

   * SNePS   (SrcCD)

     SNePS is the Semantic Network Processing System.  It is an
     implementation of a fully intensional theory of propositional knowledge
     representation and reasoning.  SNePS runs under CLISP or GCL.

     GNU `spell' is a clone of standard Unix `spell', implemented as a
     wrapper to `ispell'.

   * `stow'   (SrcCD)

     `stow' manages the installation of multiple software packages, keeping
     them separate while making them appear (via symbolic links) to be
     installed in the same place.  For example, Emacs can be installed in
     `/usr/local/stow/emacs' and Perl in `/usr/local/stow/perl', permitting
     each to be administered separately, while with `stow' they will both
     appear to be installed in `/usr/local'.

   * Superopt   (SrcCD)

     Superopt is a function sequence generator that uses an exhaustive
     generate-and-test approach to find the shortest instruction sequence for
     a given function.  You provide a function as input, a CPU to generate
     code for, and how many instructions you want.  Its use in GCC is
     described in the `ACM SIGPLAN PLDI'92 Proceedings'.  It supports: SPARC,
     m68k, m68020, m88k, IBM POWER and PowerPC, AMD 29k, Intel x86 & 960,
     Pyramid, DEC Alpha, Hitachi SH, & HP-PA.

   * Swarm   (SrcCD)

     Swarm is a software package for multi-agent simulation of complex systems
     being developed at The Santa Fe Institute.  Swarm is intended to be a
     useful tool for researchers in a variety of disciplines, especially
     artificial life.  The basic architecture of Swarm is the simulation of
     collections of concurrently interacting agents: with this architecture,
     a large variety of agent based models can be implemented.

   * `tar'   (BinCD, SrcCD)

     GNU `tar' includes multi-volume support, the ability to archive sparse
     files, compression/decompression, remote archives, and special features
     that allow `tar' to be used for incremental and full backups.  GNU `tar'
     uses an early draft of the POSIX 1003.1 `ustar' format which is
     different from the final version.  This will be corrected in the future.

   * Termcap Library   (SrcCD)   [FSFman]

     The GNU Termcap library is a drop-in replacement for `libtermcap.a' on
     any system.  It does not place an arbitrary limit on the size of Termcap

     The Source Code CD-ROM contains a minimal TeX collection, sufficient to
     process Texinfo files.  For a complete TeX distribution, including both
     sources and precompiled binaries for many platforms, consider teTeX.
     This is available on CD-ROM (see `http://www.tug.org/texlive.html'), or
     by FTP.  The FTP instructions change too frequently to include them here;
     see `ftp://ftp.tug.org/tex/unixtex.ftp'.

   * Texinfo   (SrcCD)   [FSFman]

     Texinfo is a set of utilities (`makeinfo', `info', `install-info',

     `ucblogo' implements the classic teaching language, Logo.

   * `units'

     GNU `units' converts between different units of measurement, such as
     miles/gallon to km/liter.  (It can only handle multiplicative scale
     changes, so it cannot convert Celsius to Fahrenheit though it could
     convert temperature differences between those temperatures scales.)

   * UUCP   (SrcCD)

     GNU's UUCP system (written by Ian Lance Taylor) supports the `f', `g'
     (all window & packet sizes), `v', `G', `t', `e', Zmodem, & two new

     World Wide Web browser that runs as part of Emacs.  It supports all the
     bells and whistles you find on the Web today, including frames, tables,
     stylesheets, and much more.  See
     `http://www.cs.indiana.edu/elisp/w3/docs.html'.

   * `wdiff'   (SrcCD)

     `wdiff' is a front-end to GNU `diff'.  It compares two files, finding
     the words deleted or added to the first to make the second.  It has many
     output formats and works well with terminals and pagers.  `wdiff' is
     very useful when two texts differ only by a few words and paragraphs
     have been refilled.  Plans are to merge this package into `diffutils'.

   * xmcd   *Also see* `http://sunsite.unc.edu/~cddb/xmcd/'   (SrcCD)

     `xmcd' is an X11-based CD player utility and `cda' is a command-line
     driven, non-graphical CD audio player.  `xmcd' is developed to use the
     OSF/Motif API (version 1.1 and later) and can also be used with LessTif,
     the free Motif clone.

     In its evolution over the past few years, `xmcd' has established itself
     as the premier CD player application for the X window system with an
     attractive, easy-to-use user interface.  It is feature-rich and runs on
     virtually all of the popular Unix and OpenVMS platforms.  It also
     supports the widest array of CD-ROM and CD-R devices, including some
     older SCSI-1 drives that do not work with other CD player applications.
     The remote CD database query feature fully utilizes the Internet and
     taps on a vast repository of CD artists/titles, track titles and other
     information.  Multi-disc changers are also supported.

     Like many other CD player applications, `xmcd' supports a CD database of
     disc and track titles and other information.  A distinguishing feature
     of `xmcd' is the ability to connect to a remote CD database server to
     query this information.  Many public Internet CD database servers have
     been established around the world for this purpose, and `xmcd' also
     allows the user to submit new CD entries to the master database.

   * `xshogi'   (SrcCD)

     `xshogi' is a graphical Shogi (Japanese Chess) board for the X Window
     System.  It can serve as a user interface to GNU Shogi, as a referee for
     games between two humans, or as a client for the Internet Shogi Server.

   * `Ygl'   (SrcCD)

     `Ygl' emulates a subset of SGI's GL (Graphics Language) library under
     X11 on most platforms with an ANSI C compiler (including GCC).  It has
     most two-dimensional graphics routines, the queue device & query
     routines, double buffering, RGB mode with dithering, Fortran bindings,
     etc.

   * zlibc   (SrcCD)

     Zlibc is an uncompressing C library for GNU/Linux and SunOS systems.  It
     is a preloadable shared object that allows executables to uncompress the
     datafiles that they need on the fly.  No kernel patch, no recompilation
     of these executables and no recompilation of the libraries is needed;
     the package overrides the `open' function (and other system call
     functions) in the shared library.

CD-ROMs
*******

We have two series of CD-ROMs: the Source Code CD-ROM, and the Compiler
Tools Binaries CD-ROM.

Our CDs are in ISO 9660 format & can be mounted as a read-only file system on
most computers.  If your driver supports it, you can mount each CD with "Rock
Ridge" extensions & it will look like a regular Unix file system, rather than
one full of truncated & otherwise mangled names that fit vanilla ISO 9660.

You can build most of the software without copying the sources off the CD.
You only need enough disk space for object files and intermediate build
targets.

 

Pricing of the GNU CD-ROMs
--------------------------

If a business or organization is ultimately paying, the current GNU Source
CD set costs $240.  The set costs $60 if you, an individual, are paying out
of your own pocket.  The current Compiler Tools Binaries CD-ROM costs $220
for a business or organization, and $55 for an individual.

 

What Do the Different Prices Mean?
..................................

The software on our disks is free; anyone can copy it and anyone can run it.
What we charge for is the physical disk and the service of distribution.

We charge two different prices depending on who is buying.  When a company
or other organization buys the Source CD-ROMs, we charge $240.  When an
individual buys the same CD-ROMs, we charge just $60.  This distinction is
not a matter of who is allowed to use the software.  In either case, once
you have a copy, you can distribute as many copies as you wish and there's
no restriction on who can have or run them.  The price distinction is
entirely a matter of what kind of entity pays for the CDs.

You, the reader, are certainly an individual, not a company.  If you are
buying a disk "in person", then you are probably doing so as an individual.
But if you expect to be reimbursed by your employer, then the disk is really
for the company; so please pay the company price and get reimbursed for it.
We won't try to check up on you--we use the honor system--so please cooperate.

Buying CDs at the company price is very helpful for GNU; just
150 Source CDs at that price support an FSF programmer or tech writer for a
year.

 

Why Is There an Individual Price?
.................................

In the past, our distribution tapes were ordered mainly by companies.  The CD
at the price of $240 provides them with all of our software for a much lower
price than they would previously have paid for six different tapes.  To lower
the price more would cut into the FSF's funds very badly and decrease the
software development we can do.

However, for individuals, $240 is too high a price; hardly anyone could
afford that.  So we decided to make CDs available to individuals at the lower
price of $60.

 

Is There a Maximum Price?
.........................

Our stated prices are minimum prices.  Feel free to pay a higher price if you
wish to support GNU development more.  The sky's the limit; we will accept as
high a price as you can offer.  Or simply give a donation (tax-deductible in
the U.S.) to the Free Software Foundation, a tax-exempt public charity.

 

January 1997 Compiler Tools Binaries CD-ROM
-------------------------------------------

In January 1997 we released the fourth edition of our CD-ROM that has
binaries and complete sources for GNU compiler tools for some systems which
lack a compiler.  This enables the people who use these systems to compile
GNU and other free software without having to buy a proprietary compiler.
You can also use these GNU tools to compile your own C/C++/Objective-C
programs.  Older editions of this CD are available while supplies last at a
reduced price; *Note Free Software Foundation Order Form::.

We hope to have more systems on each update of this CD.  If you can help
build binaries for new systems (especially those that don't come with a C
compiler), or have one to suggest, please contact us at the addresses on page
1.

These packages:

        * DJGPP
        * GCC/G++/Objective-C
        * GNU C Library
        * GDB
        * Binutils
        * Bison
        * Emacs (MS-DOS only)
        * Flex
        * Make
        * libg++

On these platforms:

        * `i386-msdos'
        * `hppa1.1-hp-hpux9'
        * `hppa1.1-hp-hpux10'
        * `powerpc-ibm-aix4.2'
        * `sparc-sun-solaris2.4'
        * `sparc-sun-solaris2.5'
        * `sparc-sun-sunos4.1'

 

Source Code CD-ROMs
-------------------

We have several versions of our Source Code CD-ROMs available, including:

   * July 1997 Source Code CD-ROMs, the newest release, has programs,
     bug fixes, & improvements.  See below.

   * January 1997 Source Code CD-ROMs.

   * July 1996 Source Code CD-ROMss.

   * December 1995 Source Code CD-ROMs.

   * June 1995 Source Code CD-ROM.

   * May 1994 Source Code CD-ROM.

   * November 1993 Source Code CD-ROM.

   * May 1993 Source Code CD-ROM.

   * October 1992 Source Code CD-ROM.

The older Source CDs are available while supplies last at a reduced price
(please note that the December 1994 Source CD is permanently out of stock).
All the Source CDs have Texinfo source for the GNU manuals listed in *Note
Documentation::.

Much of X11 is *not* on the older Source CDs which are just one CD
instead of two.

There are no precompiled programs on these Source CDs.  You will need a C
compiler (programs which need some other interpreter or compiler normally
provide the C source for a bootstrapping program).  We ship C compiler
binaries for some systems on the *Note Compiler Tools Binaries CD-ROM::.

 

July 1997 Source Code CD-ROMs
.............................

The 10th edition of our Source Code CD is available now with two CD-ROM disks.
It has programs, bug fixes, & improvements not on the older Source CDs.  It
has these packages, & some manuals that are not part of packages.  The
version number of each package listed might be higher on the 10th edition CD
due to new releases being made since this list was generated.

CD-ROM Subscription Service
***************************

Our subscription service enables you to stay current with the latest GNU
developments.  For a one-time cost equivalent to three Source CD-ROMs (plus
shipping in some cases), we will ship you four new versions of the *Note
Source Code CD-ROMs::.  The CD-ROMs are sent as they are issued (currently
twice a year, but we hope to make it more frequent).  We do not yet know if
we will be offering subscriptions to the Compiler Tools Binaries CD.

A subscription is an easy way to keep up with the regular bug fixes to the X
Window System.  Each edition of the *Note Source Code CD-ROMs::, has updated
sources for the X Window System.

Please note: In two cases, you must pay 4 times the normal shipping required
for a single order when you pay for each subscription.  If you're in Alaska,
Hawaii, or Puerto Rico you must add $20.00 for shipping for each
subscription.  If you're outside of the U.S., Canada, and Puerto Rico, you
must add $80.00 for each subscription.  See "CD-ROMs" and "Tax and Shipping
Costs" on the *note Free Software Foundation Order Form::.

 

FSF T-shirt
***********

The front of our T-shirt has the GNU Emacs Lisp code `(USE 'GNU)' with "`()'"
being the dancing parentheses from the cover of our `GNU Emacs Lisp Reference
Manual' (drawn by Berkeley, CA artist Etienne Suvasa).  The shirt's back has
the Preamble to the GNU General Public License.

These shirts come in black, natural (off-white), burgundy, and blue-green.
When you order, please give 3 choices.  Black is printed in white and the
other colors are printed in black.  All shirts are thick 100% cotton; black
and burgundy come in sizes M, L, XL, and XXL and the others in sizes L and XL
(they run small so you may want a larger size than usual).

GNU T-shirts often create spontaneous friendships at conferences & on
university campuses.  They also make great gifts for friends & family,
including children!

Free Software Redistributors Donate
***********************************

by Richard Stallman

The Sun Users Group Deutschland and ASCII Corporation (Japan) have added
donations to the FSF to the price of their next CD-ROM of GNU software.
Potential purchasers will know precisely how much of the price is for the FSF
and how much is for the redistributor.

Austin Code Works, a redistributor of free software, is supporting free
software development by giving the FSF 20% of the selling price for the GNU
software packages they produce and sell.  The producers of the SNOW 2.1 CD
added the words "Includes $5 donation to the FSF" to the front of their CD.
Walnut Creek CDROM and Info Magic, two more free software redistributors, are
also giving us a percentage of their selling price.  CQ Publishing made a
large donation from the sales of their book about GAWK in Japanese.

These free software support companies regularly donate a part of their income
to the Free Software Foundation to support the development of new GNU
programs.  Listing them here is our way of thanking them.  Wingnut has made a
pledge to donate 10% of their income to the FSF, and has also purchased
several Deluxe Distribution packages in Japan.	(Wingnut is SRA's special GNU
support group).	 Also see *Note Cygnus Matches Donations!::.

GNU is dedicated to having quality, easy-to-use online and printed
documentation.	GNU manuals are intended to explain underlying concepts,
describe how to use all the features of each program, and give examples of

binding.  These books have an inner cloth spine and an outer cardboard cover
that will not break or crease as an ordinary paperback will.  Currently, the
`GDB', `Emacs', `Emacs Lisp Reference', `GAWK', `Make', `Bison', and `Texinfo'
manuals have this binding.  The other GNU manuals also lie flat when opened,
using a GBC or Wire-O binding.	All of our manuals are 7in by 9.25in except
the 8.5in by 11in `Calc' manual.

`Debugging with GDB' (Edition 4.12 for Version 4.14) tells how to use the GNU
Debugger, run your program under debugger control, examine and alter data,
modify a program's flow of control, and use GDB through GNU Emacs.

The `Emacs Manual' (11th Edition for Version 19.29) describes editing with
GNU Emacs.  It explains advanced features, including outline mode and regular
expression search; how to use special modes for programming in languages like
C++ and TeX; how to use the `tags' utility; how to compile and correct code;
how to make your own keybindings; and other elementary customizations.

`Programming in Emacs Lisp, An Introduction' (Edition 1.03 for Version 19.29)
is an elementary introduction to programming in Emacs Lisp.  It is written
d511 2
a512 15
to customize or extend their computing environment.   It tells how to write
programs that find files; switchbuffers; use searches, conditionals, loops,
and recursion; how to write Emacs initialization files; and how to run the
Emacs Lisp debuggers.  If you read the text in GNU Emacs under Info mode, you
can run the sample programs directly.

The `GNU Emacs Lisp Reference Manual' (Edition 2.4 for Version 19.29) covers
this programming language in depth, including data types, control structures,
functions, macros, syntax tables, searching/matching, modes, windows,
keymaps, byte compilation, and the operating system interface.

The `GAWK Manual' (Edition 0.16 for Version 2.16) tells how to use the GNU
implementation of `awk'.  It is written for those who have never used `awk'
and describes the features of this powerful string and record manipulation
language.

`Using and Porting GNU CC' (September 1994 Edition for Version 2.6) tells how
to run, install, and port the GNU C Compiler to new systems.  It lists new
features and incompatibilities of GCC, but people not familiar with C will
still need a good reference on the C programming language.  It also covers
G++.

The `Texinfo Manual' (Edition 2.20 for Version 3) explains the markup
language used to generate both the online Info documentation and typeset
hardcopies.  It tells you how to make tables, lists, chapters, nodes,
indexes, cross references, how to use Texinfo mode in GNU Emacs, and how to
catch mistakes.	 This second edition describes over 50 new commands.

"library functions" and "system calls."	 We are doing limited copier runs of
this manual until it becomes more stable.  Please send corrections and
improvements to `bug-glibc-manual@@prep.ai.mit.edu'.

The `Emacs Calc Manual' (Edition 2.02 for Version 2.02) is both a tutorial
and a reference manual.	 It tells how to do ordinary arithmetic, how to use
Calc for algebra, calculus, and other forms of mathematics, and how to extend
Calc.

Configuring GNU Software:

We are using a uniform scheme for configuring GNU software packages in order
to compile them.  It uses the `Autoconf' program (see item below).  The goal
is to have all GNU software support the same alternatives for naming machine
and system types.   When the GNU system is complete it will be possible to
configure and build the entire system at once, eliminating the need to
separately configure each individual package.	The configuration scheme lets
you specify both the host and target system to build cross-compilation tools.



GNU software currently available:

(For new features and coming programs, see *Note Forthcoming GNUs::.)

   * `acm'	   (SrcCD, UtilT)

     `acm' is a LAN-oriented, multiplayer aerial combat simulation that runs
     under the X Window System.	 Players engage in air to air combat against
     one another using heat seeking missiles and cannons.  We are working on
     more accurate simulation of real airplane flight characteristics.

   * Autoconf	      (SrcCD, UtilT)

   * BASH	  (SrcCD, UtilT)
d686 5
a690 5
     The GNU shell, BASH (Bourne Again SHell), is compatible with the Unix
     `sh' and offers many extensions found in `csh' and `ksh'.	BASH has job
     control, `csh'-style command history, and command-line editing (with
     Emacs and `vi' modes built-in, and the ability to rebind keys) via the
     readline library.	BASH conforms to the POSIX 1003.2 shell specification.

     BFD comes with source for Texinfo documentation (not yet published on
     paper).   Presently BFD is not distributed separately; it is included
     with packages that use it.

   * Binutils	      (BinCD, DjgppD, DosCD, LangT, SrcCD)

     Binutils includes the programs: `ar', `c++filt', `demangle', `gas',
     `gprof', `ld', `nlmconv', `nm', `objcopy', `objdump', `ranlib', `size',
     `strings', and `strip'.

     Binutils Version 2 uses the BFD library.  The GNU linker `ld' emits
     source-line numbered error messages for multiply-defined symbols and
     undefined references.  It interprets a superset of the AT&T Linker
     Command Language, which gives general control over where segments are
     placed in memory.	`nlmconv' converts object files into Novell NetWare
     Loadable Modules.	`objdump' can disassemble code for a29k, ALPHA,
     H8/300, H8/500, HP-PA, i386, i960, m68k, m88k, MIPS, SH, SPARC, & Z8000
     processors, and can display other data (e.g., symbols & relocations)
     from any file format understood by BFD.

     We recently decided to change the policy for using the parsers that
     Bison generates.  It is now permitted to use Bison-generated parsers in
     non-free programs.	 *Note GNUs Flashes::.

   * GNU C Library	   (BinCD, LangT, SrcCD)

     The GNU C library supports ANSI C-1989, POSIX 1003.1-1990 and most of the
     functions in POSIX 1003.2-1992.  It is upwardly compatible with 4.4BSD
     and includes many System V functions, plus GNU extensions.

     The C Library will perform many functions of the Unix system calls in
     the Hurd.	Mike Haertel has written a fast `malloc' which wastes less
     memory than the old GNU version.  The GNU regular-expression functions
     (`regex' and `rx') now nearly conform to the POSIX 1003.2 standard.
d753 27
a779 25
     C functions.  The `fmemopen' function uses this to open a stream on a
     string, which can grow as necessary.  You can define your own `printf'
     formats to use a C function you have written.  For example, you can
     safely use format strings from user input to implement a `printf'-like
     function for another programming language.	 Extended `getopt' functions
     are already used to parse options, including long options, in many GNU
     utilities.

     The C Library runs on Sun-3 (SunOS 4.1), Sun-4 (SunOS 4.1 or Solaris 2),
     HP 9000/300 (4.3BSD), SONY News 800 (NewsOS 3 or 4), MIPS DECstation
     (Ultrix 4), DEC Alpha (OSF/1), i386/i486 (System V, SVR4, BSD, SCO 3.2 &
     SCO ODT 2.0), Sequent Symmetry i386 (Dynix 3) & SGI (Irix 4).  Texinfo
     source for the `GNU C Library Reference Manual' is included (*note
     Documentation::.); the manual is now being updated.

   * GNU C++ Library	     (BinCD, DjgppD, DosCD, LangT, SrcCD)

     The GNU C++ library (libg++) contains an extensive collection of C++
     `forest' classes, an IOStream library for input/output routines, and
     support tools for use with G++.  Supported classes include: Obstacks,
     multiple-precision Integers and Rationals, Complex numbers, arbitrary
     length Strings, BitSets and BitStrings.   Version 2.6.2 includes the
     initial release of the libstdc++ library.	This implements library
     facilities defined by the forthcoming ANSI/ISO C++ standard, including
     the Standard Template Library.

   * GNU Chess	       (SrcCD, UtilT, WdwsD)
d820 4
a823 13
     GNU Chess lets the computer play a full game of chess with you.  It runs
     on most platforms & has dumb terminal, "curses" & X terminal interfaces.
     The X terminal interface is based on the `xboard' program.
     m{No Value For "ergegrafkludge"} GNU Chess implements many specialized
     features including the null move heuristic, a hash table with aging, the
     history heuristic (another form of the earlier killer heuristic),
     caching of static evaluations, & a database which lets it play the first
     several moves of the game quickly.	  Recent improvements include better
     heuristics, faster evaluation, thinking on opponent's time, a perfect
     King and Pawn vs King endgame routine, Swedish & German language
     support, support for more book formats, a rudimentary Bobby Fischer
     clock, & bug fixes.   It is primarily supported by Stuart Cracraft, Chua
     Kong Sian, & Tim Mann on behalf of the FSF.

     edition)' and the ANSI Common Lisp standard.  CLISP includes an
     interpreter, a byte-compiler, a large subset of CLOS, a foreign language
     interface and, for some machines, a screen editor.	 The user interface
     language (English, German, French) is chooseable at run time.  Major
     packages that run in CLISP include CLX & Garnet.  CLISP needs only 2 MB
     of memory & runs on many microcomputers (including MS-DOS systems, OS/2,
     the Atari ST, Amiga 500-4000, Acorn RISC PC) & Unix-like systems
     (GNU/Linux, Sun4, SVR4, SGI, HP-UX, DEC Alpha, NeXTstep & others).

   * GNU Common Lisp	     (LspEmcT, SrcCD)

     GNU Common Lisp (GCL) has a compiler and interpreter for Common Lisp.  It
     used to be known as Kyoto Common Lisp.  It is very portable and extremely
     efficient on a wide class of applications.	 It compares favorably in
     performance with commercial Lisps on several large theorem-prover and
     symbolic algebra systems.	It supports the CLtL1 specification but is
     moving towards the proposed ANSI definition.   GCL compiles to C and
     then uses the native optimizing C compilers (e.g., GCC).  A function
     with a fixed number of args and one value turns into a C function of the
     same number of args, returning one value, so GCL is maximally efficient
     on such calls.  It has a conservative garbage collector which allows
     great freedom for the C compiler to put Lisp values in arbitrary
     registers.	 It has a source level Lisp debugger for interpreted code,
     with display of source code in an Emacs window.  Ita profiling tools
     (based on the C profiling tools) count function calls and the time spent
     in each function.	CLX works with GCL.

     There is now a builtin interface with the TK widget system.  It runs in
     a separate process so that users may monitor progress on lisp
     computations, or interact with running computations via a windowing
     interface.

     There is also an Xlib interface via C (xgcl-2).  PCL runs with GCL (see
     PCL item later in this article).  *Note Forthcoming GNUs::, for plans for
     about GCL, or for recent developments.   GCL version 2.0 is released
     under the GNU Library General Public License.

   * `cpio'	    (DjgppD, DosCD, SrcCD, UtilD, UtilT)

     `cpio' is an alternative archive program with all the features of SVR4
     `cpio', including support for the final POSIX 1003.1 `ustar' standard.
     `mt', a program to position magnetic tapes, is included with `cpio'.

   * CVS	 (SrcCD, UtilT)

     CVS, the Concurrent Version System, manages software revision and release
     control in a multi-developer, multi-directory, multi-group environment.
     It works best in conjunction with RCS versions 4 and above, but will
     parse older RCS formats with the loss of CVS's fancier features.  See
     Berliner, Brian, "CVS-II: Parallelizing Software Development,"
     `Proceedings of the Winter 1990 USENIX Association Conference'.  To find
     out how to get a copy of this report, contact `office@@usenix.org'.

   * DejaGnu	     (LangT, SrcCD)

     DejaGnu is a framework for testing other programs that provides a single
     front end for all tests.  The framework's flexibility and consistency
     makes it easy to write tests for any program.  DejaGnu comes with
     `expect', which runs scripts to conduct dialogs with programs.

     flexible formats.	It is much faster than traditional Unix versions.  The
     Diffutils package contains `diff', `diff3', `sdiff', and `cmp'.
d950 2
a951 18
     Recent Diffutils improvements include more consistent handling of
     character sets, and a new `diff' option to do all input/output in
     binary; this is useful on some non-Posix hosts.

     Plans for the Diffutils package include support for internationalization
     (e.g., error messages in Chinese), and for some non-Unix PC environments.

   * DJGPP	   (BinCD, DjgppD, DosCD)

     DJ Delorie has ported GCC/G++ 2.6.0 (see the GCC item in this section)
     to the i386 MS-DOS platform.  The DJGPP package also contains a 32-bit
     80386 DOS extender with symbolic debugger; development libraries; and
     ports of Bison, `flex', GAS, and the GNU Binutils.	 Full source code is
     provided.	It requires at least 5MB of hard disk space to install and
     512K of RAM to use.  It supports SVGA (up to 1024x768), XMS & VDISK
     memory allocation, `himem.sys', VCPI (e.g., QEMM, DESQview, & 386MAX),
     and DPMI (e.g., Windows 3.x, OS/2, QEMM, & QDPMI).	  Ask

     customizable real-time display editor and computing environment.  GNU
     Emacs is his second implementation.  It offers true Lisp--smoothly
     integrated into the editor--for writing extensions, and provides an
     interface to the X Window System.	It also runs on MS-DOS and Windows
     NT.  In addition to its powerful native command set, Emacs has
     extensions which emulate the editors vi and EDT (DEC's VMS editor).
     Emacs has many other features which make it a full computing support
     environment.  Our long term plan is now to move it in the direction of a
     WYSIWYG word processor and make it easy for beginners to use.  Source
     for the `GNU Emacs Manual', `Programming in Emacs Lisp, An
     Introduction', the `GNU Emacs Lisp Reference Manual', and a reference
     card come with the software.  *Note Documentation::.

     include: multiple X windows ("frames" to Emacs), with either a separate
     X window for the minibuffer or a minibuffer attached to each X window;
     property lists associated with regions of text in a buffer; multiple
     fonts and colors defined by those properties; simplified and improved
     processing of function keys, mouse clicks and mouse movement; X
     selection processing, including clipboard selections; hooks to be run if
     point or mouse moves outside a certain range; menu bars and popup menus
     defined by keymaps; scrollbars; before and after change hooks;
     source-level debugging of Emacs Lisp programs; European character sets
     support; floating point numbers; improved buffer allocation, including
     returning storage to the system when a buffer is killed; interfacing
     with the X resource manager; GNU configuration scheme support; good RCS
     support; & many updated libraries.

     Recent features include support for Motif widgets as well as the Athena
     widgets, displaying multiple views of an outline at the same time,
     version control support for CVS and for multiple branches, ability to
     open frames on more than one X display from a single Emacs job,
     operation on MS-DOS and MS Windows, commands to edit text properties,
     text properties for formatting text, the ability to save text properties

     Version 2 of the GNU C Compiler supports multiple languages; the source
     file name suffix or a compiler option selects the language.  The GNU C
     Compiler distribution includes support for C, C++ and Objective-C.
     Support for Objective-C was donated by NeXT.  The runtime support needed
     to run Objective-C programs is now distributed with GCC (this does not
     include any Objective-C classes aside from `object').  As much as
     possible, G++ is kept compatible with the evolving draft ANSI standard,
     but not with `cfront' (AT&T's compiler), which has been diverging from
     ANSI.

     The GNU C Compiler is a fairly portable optimizing compiler which
     performs automatic register allocation, common sub-expression
     elimination, invariant code motion from loops, induction variable
     optimizations, constant propagation and copy propagation, delayed
     popping of function call arguments, tail recursion elimination,
     integration of inline functions and frame pointer elimination,
d1165 3
a1167 8
     function optimization, optimized multiplication by constants, a certain
     amount of common subexpression elimination (CSE) between basic blocks
     (though not all of the supported machine descriptions provide for
     scheduling or delay slots), a feature for assigning attributes to
     instructions, and many local optimizations that are automatically
     deduced from the machine description.  Position-independent code is
     supported on the 68k, i386, i486, Pentium, Hitachi Slt, Hitachi H8/300,
     Clipper, 88k, SPARC & SPARClite.

     GDB can debug both C and C++ programs, and will work with executables
     produced by many different compilers; however, C++ debugging will have
     some limitations if you do not use GCC.

     GDB has a command line user interface; GNU Emacs comes with a GDB mode,
     and `xxgdb' provides an X interface (but it is not distributed or

a1305 21
     GNU Ghostscript is the GNU release of Ghostscript, which is an
     interpreter for the Postscript graphics language (*note Forthcoming
     GNUs::., for news on future plans).

     The current version of GNU Ghostscript is 2.6.2.  Features include the
     ability to use the fonts provided by the platform on which Ghostscript
     runs (X Window System and Microsoft Windows), resulting in much
     better-looking screen displays; improved text file printing (like
     `enscript'); a utility to extract the text from a Postscript language
     document; a much more reliable (and faster) Microsoft Windows
     implementation; support for Microsoft C/C++ 7.0; drivers for many new
     printers, including the SPARCprinter, and for TIFF/F (fax) file format;
     many more Postscript Level 2 facilities, including most of the color
     space facilities (but not patterns), and the ability to switch between
     Level 1 and Level 2 dynamically.  Version 2.6.2 adds a LaserJet 4 driver
     and several important bug fixes to version 2.6.1.

     Ghostscript executes commands in the Postscript language by writing
     directly to a printer, drawing on an X window, or writing to a file for
     later printing (or to a bitmap file that you can manipulate with other
     graphics programs).

     that do not want to deal with the Postscript language).  It also supports
     IBM PCs and compatibles with EGA, VGA, or SuperVGA graphics (but please
     do *not* ask the FSF staff any questions about this; we do not use PCs).

   * Ghostview	       (SrcCD, UtilT)

     Tim Theisen, `ghostview@@cs.wisc.edu', has created Ghostview, a previewer
     for multi-page files with an X11 user interface.  Ghostview and
     Ghostscript function as two cooperating programs; Ghostview creates a
     viewing window and Ghostscript draws in it.

     GNATS (GNats: A Tracking System, not to be confused with GNAT, The GNU
     Ada Translator) is a bug-tracking system.	It is based upon the paradigm
     of a central site or organization which receives problem reports and
     negotiates their resolution by electronic mail.  Although it has been
     used primarily as a software bug-tracking system so far, it is
     sufficiently generalized so that it could be used for handling system
     administration issues, project management or any number of other

     GNU `make' is on several of our tapes because some system vendors supply
     no `make' utility at all, and some native `make' programs lack the
     `VPATH' feature essential for using the GNU configure system to its full

     infinite file & line lengths, tag stacks, infinite undo & extended
     regular expressions.  It runs under GNU/Linux, BSD, NetBSD, FreeBSD,
     BSDI, AIX, HP-UX, DGUX, IRIX, PSF, PTX, Solaris, SunOS, Ultrix, Unixware
     & should port easily to many other systems.

   * GNU Objective-C Library	     (LangT, SrcCD)

     The GNU Objective-C Class Library (`libobjects') is a library of
     general-purpose, non-graphical Objective-C objects written by Andrew
     McCallum and other volunteers.  It includes collection classes for
     maintaining groups of objects and C types, streams for I/O to various
     destinations, coders for formatting objects and C types to streams, ports
     for network packet transmission, distributed objects (remote object
     messaging), string classes, pseudo-random number generators, and time
     handling facilities.  The package will also include the foundation
     classes for the GNUStep project; over 50 of these classes have already
     been implemented.	The library is known to work on i386, i486, Pentium,
     m68k, SPARC, MIPS, & RS6000.  Send queries and bug reports to
     `mccallum@@gnu.ai.mit.edu'.

   * Octave	    (LangT, SrcCD)
d1513 2
a1514 11
     Octave is a high-level language similar to MATLAB that is primarily
     intended for numerical computations.  It provides a convenient command
     line interface for solving linear and nonlinear problems numerically.
     m{No Value For "ergegrafkludge"} Octave does arithmetic for real and
     complex scalars and matrices, solves sets of nonlinear algebraic
     equations, integrates systems of ordinary differential and
     differential-algebraic equations, and integrates functions over finite
     and infinite intervals.  Two- and three-dimensional plotting is
     available using `gnuplot'.	  Send queries and bug reports to:
     `bug-octave@@che.utexas.edu'.   Source is included for a 220+ page
     Texinfo manual, which is not yet published by the FSF.

   * Oleo	  (SrcCD, UtilT)
d1518 1
a1518 7
     Oleo is a spreadsheet program (better for you than the more expensive
     spreadsheets).  It supports the X Window System and character-based
     terminals, and can output Embedded Postscript renditions of spreadsheets.
     Keybindings should be familiar to Emacs users and are configurable.
     Under X and in Postscript output, Oleo supports multiple, variable width
     fonts.   *Note Forthcoming GNUs::, for the plans for later releases of
     Oleo.
d1520 1
a1520 1
   * `p2c'	   (LangT, SrcCD)
d1522 6
a1527 3
     `p2c' is a Pascal-to-C translator written by Dave Gillespie.  It
     recognizes many Pascal dialects including Turbo, HP, VAX, and ISO, and

a1529 1
   * `patch'	     (DjgppD, DosCD, SrcCD, UtilT)
d1531 3
a1533 3
     `patch' is our version of Larry Wall's program to take `diff''s output
     and apply those differences to an original file to generate the modified
     version.
d1535 1
a1535 1
   * PCL	 (LspEmcT, SrcCD)
d1537 1
a1537 2
     PCL is a free implementation of a large subset of CLOS, the Common Lisp
     Object System.  It runs under both GCL and CLISP, mentioned above.
d1539 1
a1539 1
   * `perl'	    (LangT, SrcCD)
d1541 4
a1544 3
     Larry Wall's `perl' combines the features and capabilities of `sed',
     `awk', `sh' and C, as well as interfaces to the Unix system calls and
     many C library routines.
d1546 2
a1547 1
   * `ptx'	   (SrcCD, UtilD, UtilT)
d1549 1
a1549 4
     GNU `ptx' is our version of the traditional permuted index generator.
     It handles multiple input files at once, produces TeX compatible output,
     & outputs readable "KWIC" (KeyWords In Context) indexes.	It does not
     yet handle input files that do not fit in memory all at once.
d1551 2
a1552 1
   * `rc'	  (SrcCD, UtilT)
d1554 1
a1554 4
     `rc' is a shell that features a C-like syntax (much more so than `csh')
     and far cleaner quoting rules than the C or Bourne shells.	 It's
     intended to be used interactively, but is also great for writing
     scripts.  It inspired the shell `es'.
d1556 5
a1560 1
   * RCS	 (SrcCD, UtilD, UtilT)
d1562 1
a1562 4
     RCS, the Revision Control System, is used for version control &
     management of software projects.  When used with GNU `diff', RCS can
     handle binary files (executables, object files, 8-bit data, etc).	Also
     see the item about CVS in this section.
d1564 7
a1570 1
   * `recode'	      (SrcCD, UtilT)
d1572 1
a1572 6
     GNU `recode' converts files between character sets and usages.  When
     exact transliterations are not possible, it may get rid of the offending
     characters or fall back on approximations.	 This program recognizes or
     produces nearly 150 different character sets and is able to
     transliterate files between almost any pair.  Most RFC 1345 character
     sets are supported.
d1574 1
a1574 1
   * regex	   (LangT, SrcCD)
d1576 1
a1576 5
     The GNU regular expression library supports POSIX.2, except for
     internationalization features.  It is included in many GNU programs which
     do regular expression matching and available separately.  An alternative
     regular expression package, `rx', comes with `sed'; it has the potential
     to be faster than `regex' in most cases, but still needs work.
d1578 2
a1579 1
   * Scheme	    (SchmT, SrcCD)
d1581 1
a1581 1
     For information about Scheme, see *Note Scheme Tape::.
d1583 7
a1589 1
   * `screen'	      (SrcCD, UtilT)
d1591 1
a1591 6
     `screen' is a terminal multiplexer that runs several separate "screens"
     (ttys) on a single character-based terminal.  Each virtual terminal
     emulates a DEC VT100 plus several ISO 6429 (ECMA 48, ANSI X3.64) and ISO
     2022 functions.  Arbitrary keyboard input translation is also supported.
     `screen' sessions can be detached and resumed later on a different
     terminal type.  Output in detached sessions is saved for later viewing.
d1593 5
a1597 1
   * `sed'	   (DjgppD, DosCD, SrcCD, UtilD, UtilT)
d1599 1
a1599 2
     `sed' is a stream-oriented version of `ed'.  GNU `sed' comes with the
     `rx' library, a faster version of `regex' (*note Forthcoming GNUs::.).
d1601 5
a1605 1
   * Sharutils	       (SrcCD, UtilT)
d1607 1
a1607 14
     `shar' makes so-called shell archives out of many files, preparing them
     for transmission by electronic mail services, while `unshar' helps
     unpack these shell archives after reception.  `uuencode' prepares a file
     for transmission over an electronic channel which ignores or otherwise
     mangles the high order bit of bytes, while `uudecode' does the converse
     transformation.

   * Shellutils		(DjgppD, DosCD, SrcCD, UtilT)

     Use shellutils interactively or in shell scripts: `basename', `date',
     `dirname', `echo', `env', `expr', `false', `groups', `hostname', `id',
     `logname', `nice', `nohup', `pathchk', `printenv', `printf', `pwd',
     `sleep', `stty', `su', `tee', `test', `true', `tty', `uname', `users',
     `who', `whoami', and `yes'.
d1609 2
a1610 1
   * GNU Shogi	       (SrcCD, UtilT)
d1612 1
a1612 8
     Shogi is a Japanese game similar to Chess; a major difference is that
     captured pieces can be returned into play.	  GNU Shogi is a variant of
     GNU Chess; GNU Shogi implements the same features as GNU Chess and uses
     similar heuristics.  As a new feature, sequences of partial board
     patterns can be introduced in order to help the program play toward
     specific opening patterns.	 There are both character and X display
     interfaces.   GNU Shogi is primarily supported by Matthias Mutz on
     behalf of the FSF.
d1614 3
a1616 1
   * Smalltalk	       (LangT, SrcCD)
d1618 4
a1621 11
     GNU Smalltalk is an interpreted object-oriented programming language
     system written in highly portable C.  It has been successfully ported to
     many Unix and some other platforms, including DOS (but these non-Unix
     ports are not available from the FSF).  Current features include a
     binary image save capability, the ability to invoke user-written C code
     and pass parameters to it, a GNU Emacs editing mode, a version of the X
     protocol invocable from Smalltalk, optional byte-code compilation
     tracing and byte-code execution tracing, and automatically loaded
     per-user initialization files.  It implements all of the classes and
     protocol in the Smalltalk-80 book "Smalltalk-80: The Language", except
     for the graphic user interface (`GUI') related classes.
d1623 7
a1629 1
     *Note Forthcoming GNUs::, for plans for later releases of Smalltalk.
d1631 1
a1631 1
   * Superopt	      (LangT, SrcCD)
d1633 4
a1636 17
     Superopt is a function sequence generator that uses an exhaustive
     generate-and-test approach to find the shortest instruction sequence for
     a given function.	You provide a function as input, a CPU to generate
     code for, and how many instructions you can accept.  Its application in
     GCC is described in the `ACM SIGPLAN PLDI'92' proceedings.	 Superopt
     supports: SPARC, m68k, m68020, m88k, IBM RS/6000, AMD 29000, Intel
     80x86, Pyramid, DEC Alpha, & HP-PA.

   * `tar'	   (SrcCD, UtilT)

     GNU `tar' includes multivolume support, the ability to archive sparse
     files, automatic archive compression/decompression, remote archives and
     special features that allow `tar' to be used for incremental and full
     backups.  Unfortunately, GNU `tar' implements an early draft of the
     POSIX 1003.1 `ustar' standard which is different from the final
     standard.	Adding support for the new changes in a backward-compatible
     fashion is not trivial.
d1638 1
a1638 1
   * Termcap Library	     (SrcCD, UtilT)
d1640 6
a1645 4
     The GNU Termcap library is a drop-in replacement for `libtermcap.a' on
     any system.  It does not place an arbitrary limit on the size of Termcap
     entries, unlike most other Termcap libraries.  Included is source for the
     `Termcap Manual' in Texinfo format.  *Note Documentation::.
d1647 2
a1648 1
   * TeX	 (SrcCD)
d1650 1

   * Texinfo	     (DjgppD, DosCD, LangT, LspEmcT, SrcCD, UtilD, UtilT)

     Texinfo is a set of utilities which generate both printed manuals and
     online hypertext documentation (called "Info").  There are also programs
     for reading online Info documents.	 Version 3 has both GNU Emacs Lisp
     and standalone programs written in C or shell script.  Texinfo mode for
     GNU Emacs enables easy editing and updating of Texinfo files.  Programs
     provided include `makeinfo', `info', `texi2dvi', `texindex', `tex2patch',
     and `fixfonts'.  Source for the `Texinfo Manual' is included.  *Note
     Documentation::.

d1663 2
a1664 11
     Tile Forth is a 32-bit implementation of the Forth-83 standard written
     in C, allowing it to be easily ported to new systems, and extended with
     "any" C-function (graphics, windowing, etc).   Many Forth libraries with
     full documentation are available including ones for top-down parsing,
     multi-threads, and object oriented programming.

   * `time'	    (SrcCD, UtilT)

     `time' is used to report statistics (usually from a shell) about the
     amount of user, system and real time used by a process.  On some systems
     it also reports memory usage, page faults, and other statistics.
d1666 1
a1666 1
   * `tput'	    (SrcCD, UtilT)
d1668 3
a1670 3
     `tput' is a portable way for shell scripts to use special terminal
     capabilities.  Our `tput' uses the Termcap database, instead of Terminfo
     as most others do.
d1672 1

d1685 2
a1686 5
     `wdiff' is a front-end to GNU `diff'.  It compares two files, finding
     the words deleted or added to the first to make the second.  It has many
     output formats and works well with terminals and pagers.  `wdiff' is
     very useful when two texts differ only by a few words and paragraphs
     have been refilled.
d1688 1
a1688 1
   * `Ygl'	   (SrcCD, UtilT)
d1690 10

Tapes
*****

We offer Unix source code on tapes in `tar' format on these media:

   * 4mm DAT cartridges

   * 8mm Exabyte cartridges

   * Sun DC300XLP QIC-24 1/4in cartridges (readable on some other systems)

   * Hewlett-Packard 16-track DC600HC 1/4in cartridges

   * IBM RS/6000 QIC-150 1/4in cartridges (readable on some other systems)

   * 1600bpi 9-track 1/2in reel tape

The contents of the reel and various cartridge tapes for Unix systems are the
same (except for the RS/6000 Emacs tape, which also has executables for
Emacs); only the media are different.  For pricing information, see the *note
Free Software Foundation Order Form::..	 Source code for the manuals and
reference cards is included (*note Documentation::.).

Some of the files on the tapes may be compressed with `gzip' to make them
fit.  Refer to the top-level `README' file at the beginning of each tape for
instructions on uncompressing them.  `uncompress' and `unpack' *do not work*!

Scheme Tape
-----------
d1748 1
a1748 3
Scheme is a simplified, lexically-scoped dialect of Lisp.  It was designed at
MIT and other universities to teach students the art of programming, and to
research new parallel programming constructs and compilation techniques.
d1750 32
a1781 4
This tape now contains MIT Scheme 7.3, which conforms to the "Revised^4
Report On the Algorithmic Language Scheme" (MIT AI Lab Memo 848b), for which
TeX source is included.	 It is written partly in C, but is presently hard to
bootstrap.  Binaries that can be used to bootstrap Scheme are available for:
d1783 1
a1783 1
   * HP 9000 series 300, 400, 700 & 800 running HP-UX 7.0 or 8.0
d1785 4
a1788 1
   * NeXT running NeXT OS 1.0 or 2.0
d1790 1
a1790 1
   * Sun-3 or Sun-4 running SunOS 4.1
d1792 1

If your system is not on this list and you don't enjoy the bootstrap
challenge, see the JACAL item in *Note GNU Software::.

X11 Tapes
---------
d1830 6
a1835 6
The two X11 tapes contain Version 11, Release 6 of the X Window System.	 The
first tape contains all of the core software, documentation and some
contributed clients.  We call this the "required" X tape since it is
necessary for running X or running GNU Emacs under X.  The second, "optional"
tape contains contributed libraries and other toolkits, the Andrew User
Interface System, games, and other programs.
d1837 1
a1837 3
The X11 Required tape also contains all fixes and patches released to date.
We update this tape as new fixes and patches are released for programs on
both tapes.  *Note Tape & CD-ROM Subscription Service::.
d1839 4
a1842 2
We will distribute X11R5 on tape until X11R6 is stable, and on the *Note
November 1993 Source Code CD-ROM::, while supplies last.

Berkeley 4.4BSD-Lite Tape
-------------------------
d1855 2
a1856 4
The "4.4BSD-Lite" release is the last from the Computer Systems Research
Group at the University of California at Berkeley.  It has most of the BSD
software system, except for a few files that remain proprietary.  It is much
more complete than the previous "Net2" release.

VMS Emacs and VMS Compiler Tapes
--------------------------------
d1868 7
a1874 9
We offer two VMS tapes.	 One has just GNU Emacs 18.59 (none of the other
software on the *Note Lisps/Emacs Tape::, is included).	 The other has GCC
2.3.3, Bison 1.19 (to compile GCC), GAS 1.38 (to assemble GCC's output) and
some library and include files (none of the other software on the *Note
Languages Tape::, is included).	 We are not aware of a GDB port for VMS.
Both VMS tapes have DEC VAX executables from which you can bootstrap, as the
DEC VMS C compiler cannot compile GCC.	We do not have executables for DEC
Alpha VMS systems.  Please do not ask us to devote effort to VMS support,
because it is peripheral to the GNU Project.

CD-ROMs

d1883 14
a1896 1
We offer these CD-ROMs:
d1898 1
a1898 1
   * *Note MS-DOS CD-ROM::, expected in September 1995.
d1900 2
a1901 1
   * *Note Debian GNU/Linux CD-ROM::, expected in late fall 1995.

d1912 5
a1916 1
   * *Note November 1993 Source Code CD-ROM::.
d1918 1
a1918 5
Our CD-ROMs are in ISO 9660 format & can be mounted as a read-only file
system on most computers.  If your driver supports it you can mount each
CD-ROM with "Rock Ridge" extensions (the MS-DOS CD-ROM is only in ISO 9660
format) & it will look just like an ordinary Unix file system, rather than
one full of truncated & otherwise mangled names that fit vanilla ISO 9660.
d1920 3
a1922 3
You can build most of the software without copying the sources off the CD.
You only need enough disk space for object files and intermediate build
targets.

Pricing of the GNU CD-ROMs
--------------------------
d1958 24
a1981 4
If a business or organization is ultimately paying, the June 1995 Source CD
costs $240.  It costs $60 if you, an individual, are paying out of your own
pocket.	 The December 1994 Compiler Tools Binaries CD-ROM costs $220 for a
business or organization, and $55 for an individual.
d1983 1
d1985 4
d1990 1
a1990 1
What do the individual and company prices mean?
d1992 3
a1994 2
The software on our disk is free; anyone can copy it and anyone can run it.
What we charge for is the physical disk and the service of distribution.
d1996 1
a1996 8
We charge two different prices depending on who is buying.  When a company or
other organization buys the June 1995 Source CD-ROM, we charge $240.  When an
individual buys the same disk, we charge just $60.

This distinction is not a matter of who is allowed to use the software.	 In
either case, once you have a copy, you can distribute as many copies as you
wish, and there's no restriction on who can have or run them.  The price
distinction is entirely a matter of what kind of entity pays for the CD.
d1998 21
a2018 5
You, the reader, are certainly an individual, not a company.  If you are
buying a disk "in person", then you are probably doing so as an individual.
But if you expect to be reimbursed by your employer, then the disk is really
for the company; so please pay the company price and get reimbursed for it.
We won't try to check up on you--we use the honor system--so please cooperate.
d2020 1
a2020 2
Buying CDs at the company price is very helpful for GNU; just 140 Source CDs
at that price supports an FSF programmer or tech writer for a year.
d2022 4
d2027 1
d2029 2
a2030 1
Why is there an individual price?
d2032 1
a2032 5
In the past, our distribution tapes have been ordered mainly by companies.
The CD at the price of $240 provides them with all of our software for a much
lower price than they would previously have paid for six different tapes.  To
lower the price more would cut into the FSF's funds very badly, and decrease
the software development we can do.
d2034 3
a2036 3
However, for individuals, $240 is too high a price; hardly anyone could
afford that.  So we decided to make CDs available to individuals at the lower
price of $60.
d2038 2
d2041 1
d2043 3
a2045 1
Is there a maximum price?
d2047 1
a2047 4
Our stated prices are minimum prices.  Feel free to pay a higher price if you
wish to support GNU development more.  The sky's the limit; we will accept as
high a price as you can offer.	Or simply give a donation (tax-deductible in
the U.S.) to the Free Software Foundation, a tax-exempt public charity.

We expect to release our first CD-ROM for MS-DOS in September, 1995.  Contact
either address on page 1 for more information at that time.   The MS-DOS CD
will be packaged inside a book describing its contents.	 It will have all the
sources and executables on the MS-DOS Diskettes.  For details and version

Debian GNU/Linux CD-ROM
-----------------------
d2071 1
a2071 16
The FSF expects to ship a CD-ROM with Debian GNU/Linux on it in the late fall
1995.  This CD will be packaged inside a book describing its contents.
m{No Value For "ergegrafkludge"} Debian GNU/Linux is a complete operating
system for x86 machines, available in both source code and binary form.	 It
is a GNU/Linux system--that is to say, a variant GNU system which uses Linux
as the kernel.	(All the systems now available which use the Linux kernel are
GNU/Linux systems.)

Debian is being developed by Ian Murdock and the Debian Association in
conjunction with the Free Software Foundation.	We are distributing it as an
interim measure until the GNU kernel (the Hurd) is ready for users.

Debian GNU/Linux is available for FTP at `ftp.cps.cmich.edu' in file
`/pub/debian'.	For more information about the Debian Project and how to get
involved, see `/pub/gnu/GNUinfo/DEBIAN' on a GNU FTP host (*note How to Get
GNU Software::. for a list).

December 1994 Compiler Tools Binaries CD-ROM
--------------------------------------------

We are now offering a CD-ROM that contains executables for GNU compiler tools
for some systems which lack a compiler.	 This enables the people who use
these systems to compile GNU and other free software without having to buy a
proprietary compiler.  You can also use the GNU compilation system to compile
your own C/C++/Objective-C programs.
d2084 1
a2084 4
We hope to have more systems on each update of this CD.	 If you can help
build binaries for new systems (especially those that don't come with a C
compiler), or have one to suggest, please contact us at the addresses on page
1.

There are no precompiled programs on these Source CDs.	You will need a C
compiler (programs which need some other interpreter or compiler normally
provide the C source for a bootstrapping program).  We ship C compiler
binaries for some systems on the *Note Compiler Tools Binaries CD-ROM::.

The GNUish MS-DOS Project ported GNU software to PC compatibles.  Though the
GNUish Project is no longer active, users still ask for these ports that were
done several years ago.	 You can anonymous FTP files
`/pub/gnu/MicrosPorts/MSDOS*' from `prep.ai.mit.edu' to find out how to
access these ports over the Internet.  We offer these programs on five
diskettes.  In general, this software will run on 8086 and 80286-based 16-bit
machines; an 80386 is not required.  Some of these utilities are necessarily
missing features.   Included are: `cpio', `diff', `find', `flex', `gdbm',
`grep', `indent', `less', `m4', `make', `ptx', RCS, `sed', `shar', `sort', &
Texinfo.

Tape & CD-ROM Subscription Service
**********************************
d3321 14
a3334 6
If you do not have net access, our subscription service enables you to stay
current with the latest GNU developments.  For a one-time cost equivalent to
three tapes or CD-ROMs (plus shipping in some cases), we will ship you four
new versions of the tape of your choice or the Source Code CD-ROM.  The tapes
are sent each quarter; the CD-ROMs are sent as they are issued (which is
between two and four times a year.)
d3336 3
a3338 5
Regularly, we will send you a new version of an Lisps/Emacs, Languages,
Utilities, or X Window System (X11R6) Required tape or the Source CD-ROM.
The MIT Scheme and X Window System Optional tapes are not changed often
enough to warrant quarterly updates.  We do not yet know if we will be
offering subscriptions to the Compiler Tools Binaries or our new CD-ROMs.
d3340 1
a3340 3
Since Emacs 19 is on the Lisps/Emacs Tape and the Source CD-ROM, a
subscription to either is an easy way to keep current with Emacs 19 as it
evolves.
d3342 2
a3343 4
A subscription is an easy way to keep up with the regular bug fixes to the X
Window System.	We update the X11R6 Required tape as fixes and patches are
issued throughout the year.  Each new edition of the *Note Source Code
CD-ROMs::, also has updated sources for the X Window System.
d3345 4
a3348 6
Please note: In two cases, you must pay 4 times the normal shipping required
for a single order when you pay for each subscription.	If you're in Alaska,
Hawaii, or Puerto Rico you must add $20.00 for shipping for each
subscription.  If you're outside of U.S., Canada, and Puerto Rico, you have
to add $80.00 for each subscription.  See "Unix and VMS Software" & "Shipping
Instructions" on the *note Free Software Foundation Order Form::..

The Deluxe Distribution
***********************
d3363 4
a3366 5
The Free Software Foundation has been asked repeatedly to create a package
that provides executables for all of our software.  Normally we offer only
sources.  In addition to providing binaries with the source code, the Deluxe
Distribution includes a complete set of our printed manuals and reference
cards.
d3368 1
a3368 3
The FSF Deluxe Distribution contains the binaries and sources to hundreds of
different programs including GNU Emacs, the GNU C Compiler, the GNU Debugger,
the complete X Window System, and all the GNU utilities.
d3370 10
a3379 27
We will make a Deluxe Distribution for any machine, with any operating
system.	 We will send someone to your office to do the compilation, if we
can't find a suitable machine close to us!  However, we can only compile the
programs that already support your chosen machine and system  - porting is a
separate matter (if you wish to commission a port, see the GNU Service
Directory, details in *Note Free Software Support::).  Compiling all these
programs take time; a Deluxe Distribution for an unusual machine will take
longer to produce then one for a common machine.  Please contact the FSF
office if you have any questions.

We supply the software in one of these tape formats in Unix `tar' format:
1600 or 6250bpi 1/2in reel, Sun DC300XLP 1/4in cartridge - QIC24,
Hewlett-Packard 16-track DC600HC 1/4in cartridge, IBM RS/6000 1/4in cartridge
- QIC 150, Exabyte 8mm cartridge, or DAT 4mm cartridge.	 If your computer
cannot read any of these, please contact us to see if we can handle your
format.

The manuals included are one each of the `Bison', `Calc', `Gawk', `GNU C
Compiler', `GNU C Library', `GDB', `Flex', `GNU Emacs Lisp Reference',
`Programming in Emacs Lisp: An Introduction', `Make', `Texinfo', & `Termcap'
manuals; six copies of the `GNU Emacs' manual; and a packet of ten reference
cards each for GNU Emacs, Bison, Calc, Flex, & GDB.   Every Deluxe
Distribution also includes a copy of the latest editions of our CD-ROMs
(including the MS-DOS CD & the Debian GNU/Linux CD when they are available)
that contain sources of our software & compiler tool binaries for some
systems.  The MS-DOS CD is in ISO 9660 format.	The other CDs are in ISO 9660
format with Rock Ridge extensions.

The price of the Deluxe Distribution is $5000 (shipping included).  These
sales provide enormous financial assistance to help the FSF develop more free

FSF T-shirt
***********
d3398 2
a3399 14
Our latest T-shirt has artwork by Berkeley, CA artist Etienne Suvasa.  The
front has the ever-popular picture of GNArnold from the `Flex Manual', while
the back has the Preamble to the GNU General Public License.

They are available in two colors, Natural & Black.  Natural is an off-white,
unbleached, undyed, environment-friendly cotton, printed with black ink, & is
great for tye-dyeing or displaying as is.  Black is printed with white ink &
is perfect for late night hacking.  All shirts are thick 100% cotton, & are
available in sizes M, L, XL & XXL.  This shirt makes a great gift for your
favorite hacker!

The previous version of the T-shirt will be available while supplies last,
but please contact the FSF to see if we have what you would like before
ordering.

Major Changes in GNU Software and Documentation
***********************************************

   * Hurd Progress   (Also *note What Is the Hurd::.)

     We have made three test releases of the Hurd, the most recent being 0.2.
     The Hurd is currently much more reliable than previously, and various
     utilities and file system translators, such as an FTP file system, have
     been written that take advantage of the Hurd's unique design.

     One way for people to help out is to compile and run as much third-party
     free software as they can; in this way we can find bugs and deficiencies
     with some rapidity.  Volunteers with a PC are therefore eagerly sought to
     get the 0.2 release and compile their favorite Unix programs and games.

     Daily snapshots of the Hurd sources are now available for those that
     want to see the latest (non-stable) version; see the Hurd page on the
     FSF Web site, `http://www.gnu.ai.mit.edu', for more information.

   * New Source Code CD!   (*note July 1997 Source Code CD-ROMs::.)

     We are releasing the July 1997 (Edition 10) Source Code CD-ROM this
     month.  Once again, it is a two disk set.  It includes several new
     packages: `aegis', `cook', `guavac', `lesstif', `prcs', `rsync', `swarm',
     & `vera'.  On the CD-ROMs are full distributions of X11R6.3,,
     Emacs, GCC, and current versions of all other GNU Software.  *Note GNU
     Software::, for more about these packages.

   * New/Updated Manuals since Last Bulletin   (*note Documentation::.)

     Since the last bulletin, we have published several updated editions of
     our manuals (note the price changes): `GNU Emacs Manual', revised for
     GNU Emacs version 20, now $30; & `Texinfo Manual', for version 3.11 of
     Texinfo, now $25.  We hope to have the following available very soon:
     `GNU Tar manual', first time in print, freshly reorganized and
     rewritten, $20; `GNU Software for MS-Windows and MS-DOS', a book and
     CD-ROM set with a variety of GNU software compiled for MS-DOS and
     Windows 3.1/95/97/NT, $35 ($140 for corporate orders).  Watch our Web
     site, `http://www.gnu.ai.mit.edu', for announcements of these
     publications.

   * Fonts freed

     A free commercial-quality set of the basic 35 Postscript Type 1 fonts is
     now finally available.  The copyright holder of these fonts, URW++
     Design and Development Incorporated, has decided to release them under
     the GPL.  Each font includes `.pfb' (outlines), `.afm' (metrics), and
     `.pfm' (Windows printer metrics) files.  The fonts are compatible with
     Adobe Type Manager and with general Type 1 manipulation tools, as well
     as with Ghostscript and other Postscript language interpreters.

     The fonts are available in `ghostscript-fonts-4.0.tar.gz' on the usual
     FTP sites.

   * DDD now works with LessTif   (Also *note GNU Software::.) Release 2.1.1
     of DDD, the Data Display Debugger, now works with LessTif, a free Motif
     clone.

   * Give to GNU the United Way!

     As a 501(c)3 tax-exempt organization, the FSF is eligible to receive
     United Way funds.  When donating to United Way, one can specify that all
     or part of the donation be directed to the FSF.  On the donor form,
     check the "Specific Requests" box and include the sentence, "Send my
     gift to the Free Software Foundation, 59 Temple Place, Suite 330,
     Boston, MA 02111." We especially appreciate the donations from Microsoft
     matching the United Way donations of their employees.  Also see *Note
     Donations Translate Into Free Software::, and *Note Cygnus Matches
     Donations!::.

   * Tapes and MS-DOS Diskettes No Longer Available from the FSF

     We no longer offer tapes or MS-DOS diskettes due to very low demand.

   * GNU Software Works on MS-DOS   (Also *note GNU Software::.)

     GNU Emacs 19 and many other GNU programs have been ported to MS-DOS for
     i386/i486/Pentium machines.  We ship binaries & sources on the *Note
     Compiler Tools Binaries CD-ROM::.

   * The FSF Takes Discover

     The Free Software Foundation now accepts the Discover card for orders or
     donations.  We also accept the following: Carte Blanche, Diner's Club,
     JCB, MasterCard, Visa, and American Express.  Note that we are charged
     about 5% of an order's total amount in credit card processing fees;
     please consider paying by check instead or adding on a 5% donation to
     make up the difference.  We do *not* recommend that you send credit card
     numbers to us via email, since we have no way of insuring that the
     information will remain confidential.

   * MULE Merge Complete

     MULE is the Multi-Lingual Emacs developed by Ken'ichi Handa at the
     Electrotechnical Lab in Tsukuba, Japan.  This code has been merged into
     Emacs and is included in Emacs 20.

   * GPC, the GNU Pascal Compiler

     The GNU Pascal Compiler (GPC) is part of the GNU compiler family, GNU CC
     or GCC.  It combines a Pascal front end with the proven GNU compiler
     backend for code generation and optimization.  Unlike utilities such as
     p2c, this is a true compiler, not just a converter.

     Version 2.0 of GPC corresponds to GCC version 2.7.2.1.

     The purpose of the GNU Pascal project is to produce a compiler which:
        * combines the clarity of Pascal with powerful tools suitable for
          real-life programming,

        * supports both the Pascal standard and the Extended Pascal standard
          as defined by ISO, ANSI and IEEE.  (ISO 7185:1990, ISO/IEC
          10206:1991, ANSI/IEEE 770X3.160-1989)

        * supports other Pascal standards (UCSD Pascal, Borland Pascal,
          Pascal-SC) in so far as this serves the goal of clarity and
          usability,

        * can generate code for and run on any computer for which the GNU C
          Compiler can generate code and run on.

     The current release (2.0) implements Standard Pascal (ISO 7185, level 0)
     and a large subset of Extended Pascal (ISO 10206) and Borland Pascal.

     The upcoming release 2.1 features better conformance to the various
     Pascal standards, and of course bug fixes.

     A growing group of GPC enthusiasts contributes to the project with code,
     bug reports or fixes.

     `http://agnes.dida.physik.uni-essen.de/~gnu-pascal/', also known as
     `http://home.pages.de/~gnu-pascal/', is the GNU Pascal home page;
     sources may be downloaded from `ftp://kampi.hut.fi/jtv/gnu-pascal/'
     (official) or `ftp://agnes.dida.physik.uni-essen.de/pub/gnu-pascal/'
     (development versions).

   * GUILE

     GUILE 1.2 is released.  GNU's Ubiquitous Intelligent Language for
     Extension is an SCM-based library that can make any ordinary C program
     extensible.  (For SCM info, see "JACAL" in *Note GNU Software::.)
     Nightly snapshots of the development sources are also available, in
     `ftp://ftp.red-bean.com/pub/guile/guile-core-snap.tar.gz'.

     Also being developed are SCSH-compatible system call & Tk interfaces, a
     module system, dynamic linking support, & a byte-code interpreter.
     Support for Emacs Lisp & a more C-like language is coming.

   * A New FSF T-shirt!

     We have a new T-shirt design.  *Note FSF T-shirt::, for the description.

   * New free game

     In August 1995, the action game Abuse by Jonathan Clark was released for
     the first time.  It wasn't free software then--but now, less than two
     years later, the company Crack dot Com has rereleased it as free
     software.  Abuse was initially developed on Linux-based GNU systems, and
     we've included it on our our source CD set.

     Beyond providing the free software community with a game that many
     people enjoy, and code that could be useful for developing other free
     games, this demonstrates an important fact about the economic
     circumstances of computer game development: most non-free games bring
     their profit in a very short period of time.  Therefore, a game company
     can turn a game into free software fairly soon, with little hardship.

     Let's hope that other game developers follow this example.



The Deluxe Distribution
***********************

The Free Software Foundation has been asked repeatedly to create a package
that provides executables for all of our software.  Normally we offer only
sources.  The Deluxe Distribution provides binaries with the source code and
includes six T-shirts, all our CD-ROMs, printed manuals, & reference cards.
a224 3
The FSF Deluxe Distribution contains the binaries and sources to hundreds of
different programs including Emacs, the GNU C/C++ Compiler, the GNU Debugger,
the complete X Window System, and all the GNU utilities.
a225 41
We will make a Deluxe Distribution for most machines/operating systems.  We
may be able to send someone to your office to do the compilation, if we can't
find a suitable machine here.  However, we can only compile the programs that
already support your chosen machine/system - porting is a separate matter.
(To commission a port, see the GNU Service Directory; details in *Note Free
Software Support::.) Compiling all these programs takes time; a Deluxe
Distribution for an unusual machine will take longer to produce than one for
a common machine.  Please contact the FSF Office with any questions.

We supply the software on a write-once CD-ROM (in ISO 9660 format with "Rock
Ridge" extensions), or on one of these tapes in Unix `tar' format: 1600 or
6250bpi 1/2in reel, Sun DC300XLP 1/4in cartridge - QIC24, IBM RS/6000 1/4in
c.t. - QIC 150, Exabyte 8mm c.t., or DAT 4mm c.t.  If your computer cannot
read any of these, please contact us to see if we can handle your format.

The manuals included are one each of `Bison', `Calc', `GAWK', `GCC', `GNU C
Library', `GDB', `Flex', `GNU Emacs Lisp Reference', `Programming in Emacs
Lisp: An Introduction', `Make', `Texinfo', & `Termcap' manuals; six copies of
the `GNU Emacs' manual; and ten reference cards each for Emacs, Bison, Calc,
Flex, & GDB.

Every Deluxe Distribution also has a copy of the latest editions of our
CD-ROMs that have sources of our software & compiler tool binaries for some
systems.  The CDs are in ISO 9660 format with Rock Ridge extensions.

The price of the Deluxe Distribution is $5000 (shipping included).  These
sales provide enormous financial assistance to help the FSF develop more free
software.  To order, please fill out the "Deluxe Distribution" section on the

The `GNU Emacs Manual' (13th Edition for Version 20) describes editing with
GNU Emacs.  It explains advanced features, including international character
sets; outline mode and regular expression search; how to use special
programming modes to write languages like C++ and TeX; how to use the `tags'
utility; how to compile and correct code; how to make your own keybindings;
and other elementary customizations.

`The GNU Emacs Lisp Reference Manual' (Edition 2.4 for Version 19.29) and
`The GNU Emacs Lisp Reference, Japanese Edition' (Japanese Draft Revision
1.0, from English Edition 2.4 for Version 19.29) cover this programming
language in depth, including data types, control structures, functions,
macros, syntax tables, searching/matching, modes, windows, keymaps, byte
compilation, and the operating system interface.

`The GNU Awk User's Guide' (Edition 1.0 for Version 3.0) tells how to use
`gawk'.  It is written for those who have never used `awk' and describes
features of this powerful string and record manipulation language.  It
clearly delineates those features which are part of POSIX `awk' from `gawk'
extensions, providing a comprehensive guide to `awk' program portability.

will still need a good reference on the C programming language.  It also
covers G++.

The `Texinfo' manual (Edition 2.24 for Version 3) explains the markup

We also offer *Note CD-ROMs::, and printed *Note Documentation::, which
includes manuals and reference cards.  In the articles describing the
contents of each medium, the version number listed after each program name
was current when we published this Bulletin.  When you order a newer CD-ROM,
some of the programs may be newer and therefore the version number higher.
*Note Free Software Foundation Order Form::, for ordering information.

Some of the contents of our FTP distributions are compressed.  We have
software on our FTP sites to uncompress these files.  Due to patent troubles
with `compress', we use another compression program, `gzip'.

You may need to build GNU `make' before you build our other software.  Some
vendors supply no `make' utility at all and some native `make' programs lack
the `VPATH' feature essential for using the GNU configure system to its full
extent.  The GNU `make' sources have a shell script to build `make' itself on
such systems.

We welcome all bug reports and enhancements sent to the appropriate
electronic mailing list (*note Free Software Support::.).

 

Configuring GNU Software
------------------------

We are using Autoconf, a uniform scheme for configuring GNU software packages
in order to compile them (see "Autoconf" and "Automake" below, in this
article).  The goal is to have all GNU software support the same alternatives
for naming machine and system types.

Ultimately, it will be possible to configure and build the entire system all
at once, eliminating the need to configure each individual package separately.

You can also specify both the host and target system to build
cross-compilation tools.  Most GNU programs now use Autoconf-generated
configure scripts.

     At present, BFD is not distributed separately; it is included with
     packages that use it.

   * Binutils   (BinCD, SrcCD)

     Binutils includes these programs: `addr2line', `ar', `c++filt', `gas',
     `gprof', `ld', `nm', `objcopy', `objdump', `ranlib', `size', `strings', &
     `strip'.

     Binutils version 2 uses the BFD library.  The GNU assembler, `gas',
     supports the a29k, Alpha, ARM, D10V, H8/300, H8/500, HP-PA, i386, i960,
     M32R, m68k, m88k, MIPS, Matsushita 10200 and 10300, NS32K, PowerPC,
     RS/6000, SH, SPARC, Tahoe, Vax, and Z8000 CPUs, and attempts to be
     compatible with many other assemblers for Unix and embedded systems.  It
     can produce mixed C and assembly listings, and includes a macro facility
     similar to that in some other assemblers.  GNU's linker, `ld', supports
     shared libraries on many systems, emits source-line numbered error
     messages for multiply-defined symbols and undefined references, and
     interprets a superset of AT&T's Linker Command Language, which gives
     control over where segments are placed in memory.  `objdump' can
     disassemble code for most of the CPUs listed above, and can display
     other data (e.g., symbols and relocations) from any file format read by
     BFD.

   * C Library (`glibc')   (BinCD, SrcCD)   [FSFman]

     The GNU C library supports ISO C-1989, ISO C/amendment 1-1995, POSIX
     1003.1-1990, POSIX 1003.1b-1993, POSIX 1003.1c-1995 (when the underlying
     system permits), & most of the functions in POSIX 1003.2-1992.  It is
     nearly compliant with the extended XPG4.2 specification which guarantees
     upward compatibility with 4.4BSD & many System V functions.

     When used with the GNU Hurd, the C Library performs many functions of the
     Unix system calls directly.  Mike Haertel has written a fast `malloc'
     which wastes less memory than the old GNU version.
d502 25
a526 27
     C functions.  Two methods for handling translated messages help writing
     internationalized programs & the user can adopt the environment the
     program runs in to conform with local conventions.  Extended `getopt'
     functions are already used to parse options, including long options, in
     many GNU utilities.  The name lookup functions now are modularized which
     makes it easier to select the service which is needed for the specific
     database & the document interface makes it easy to add new services.
     Texinfo source for the `GNU C Library Reference Manual' is included
     (*note Documentation::.).

     Previous versions of the GNU C library ran on a large number of systems.
     The architecture-dependent parts of the C library have not been updated
     since development on version 2.0 started, so today it runs out of the
     box only on GNU/Hurd (all platforms GNU/Hurd also runs on) & GNU/Linux
     (ix86, Alpha, m68k, MIPS, Sparc, PowerPC; work is in progress for ARM).
     Other architectures will become available again as soon as somebody does
     the port.

   * C++ Library (`libg++')   (BinCD, SrcCD)

     The GNU C++ library (traditionally called `libg++') includes libstdc++,
     which implements the library facilities defined by the forthcoming ISO
     C++ standard.  This includes strings, iostream, and various container
     classes.  All of this is templatized.

     The package also contains the older libg++ library for backward
     compatibility, but new programs should avoid using it.

     edition)' & the ANSI Common Lisp standard.  CLISP includes an
     interpreter, a byte-compiler, a large subset of CLOS & a foreign language
     interface.  The user interface language (English, German, French) can be
     chosen at run time.  An X11 API is available through CLX & Garnet.
     CLISP needs only 2 MB of memory & runs on all kinds of Unix systems & on
     many microcomputers (including MS-DOS systems, OS/2, Windows NT, Windows
     95, Amiga 500-4000, & Acorn RISC PC).  See also item "Common Lisp",
     which describes GCL, a complete Common Lisp implementation with compiler.

   * CLX   (SrcCD)

     CLX is an X Window interface library for GCL.  This is separate from the
     built-in TK interface.

   * Common Lisp (`gcl')   (SrcCD)

     GNU Common Lisp (GCL, formerly known as Kyoto Common Lisp) is a compiler
     & interpreter for Common Lisp.  GCL is very portable & extremely
     efficient on a wide class of applications, & compares favorably in
     performance with commercial Lisps on several large theorem-prover &
     symbolic algebra systems.  GCL supports the CLtL1 specification but is
     moving towards the proposed ANSI standard.

     GCL compiles to C & then uses the native optimizing C compiler (e.g.,
     GCC).  A function with a fixed number of args & one value turns into a C
     function of the same number of args, returning one value--so GCL is
     maximally efficient on such calls.  Its conservative garbage collector
     gives great freedom to the C compiler to put Lisp values in registers.
     It has a source level Lisp debugger for interpreted code & displays
     source code in an Emacs window.  Its profiler (based on the C profiling
     tools) counts function calls & the time spent in each function.

     There is now a built-in interface to the Tk widget system.  It runs in a
     separate process, so users may monitor progress on Lisp computations or
     interact with running computations via a windowing interface.

     There is also an Xlib interface via C (xgcl-2).  CLX runs with GCL, as
     does PCL (see "PCL" later in this article).

     GCL version 2.2.2 is released under the GNU Library General Public
     License.

   * cook   (SrcCD)

     Cook is a tool for constructing files, and maintaining referential
     integrity between files.  It is given a set of files to create, and
     recipes of how to create and maintain them.  In any non-trivial program
     there will be prerequisites to performing the actions necessary to
     creating any file, such as include files.  The `cook' program provides a
     mechanism to define these.

     Some features which distinguish Cook include a strong procedural
     description language, and fingerprints to supplement file modification
     time stamps.  There is also a `make2cook' utility included to ease
     transition.

   * `cpio'   (SrcCD)

     `cpio' is an archive program with all the features of SVR4 `cpio',
     including support for the final POSIX 1003.1 `ustar' standard.  `mt', a
     program to position magnetic tapes, is included with `cpio'.

   * CVS   (SrcCD)

     CVS is a version control system (like RCS or SCCS) which allows you to
     keep old versions of files (usually source code), keep a log of who,
     when, and why changes occurred, etc.  It handles multiple developers,
     multiple directories, triggers to enable/log/control various operations,
     and can work over a wide area network.  It does not handle build
     management or bug-tracking; these are handled by `make' and GNATS,
     respectively.

   * `cxref'   (SrcCD)

     `cxref' is a program that will produce documentation (in LaTeX or HTML)
     including cross-references from C program source code.  It has been
     designed to work with ANSI C, incorporating K&R, and most popular GNU
     extensions.  The documentation for the subject program is produced from
     comments in the code that are appropriately formatted.  The cross
     referencing comes from the code itself and requires no extra work.

   * DDD   (SrcCD)

     The Data Display Debugger (DDD) is a common graphical user interface to
     GDB, DBX, and XDB, the popular Unix debuggers.  DDD provides a graphical
     data display where complex data structures can be explored incrementally
     and interactively.  DDD has been designed to compete with well-known
     commercial debuggers; as of release 2.1.1, DDD also compiles and runs
     with LessTif, a free Motif clone, without loss of functionality.  For
     more details, see the DDD WWW page at
     `http://www.cs.tu-bs.de/softech/ddd/'.

   * DejaGnu   (SrcCD)

     DejaGnu is a framework to test programs with a single front end for all

     flexible formats.  It is much faster than traditional Unix versions.  The
     Diffutils package has `diff', `diff3', `sdiff', & `cmp'.  Future plans
     include support for internationalization (e.g., error messages in
     Chinese) & some non-Unix PC environments, & a library interface that can
     be used by other free software.

   * DJGPP   *Also see "GCC" below*   (BinCD)

     DJ Delorie has ported GCC/G++ to i386s running DOS.  DJGPP has a 32-bit
     i386 DOS extender with a symbolic debugger, development libraries, &
     ports of Bison, `flex', & Binutils.  Full source code is provided.  It
     needs at least 5MB of hard disk space to install & 512K of RAM to use.
     It supports SVGA (up to 1024x768), XMS & VDISK memory allocation,
     `himem.sys', VCPI (e.g., QEMM, DESQview, & 386MAX), & DPMI (e.g.,
     Windows 3.x, OS/2, QEMM, & QDPMI).  Version 2 was released in Feb. 1996,

     Emacs 20.1 was just released recently.  Its main new features include
     support for many languages and many character codes (the MULE facility)
     and a new convenient customization feature.  The text-filling commands
     handle indented and bulleted paragraphs conveniently; there are new help
     facilities for looking up documentation about functions and symbols in
     various languages.  A new method of file-locking works even when using
     NFS.  Some dired commands have been made more systematic.

     We believe Emacs 20 operates on the same systems as Emacs 19, but we do
     not have confirmation for all of them.

   * Emacs 19   (SrcCD)   [FSFman(s), FSFrc]

   * GCC   (BinCD, SrcCD)   [FSFman]

     Version 2 of the GNU C Compiler supports the languages C, C++, and
     Objective-C; the source file name suffix or a compiler option selects
     the language.  (Also see "GNAT" later in this article for Ada language
     supports.) Objective-C support was donated by NeXT.  The runtime support
     needed to run Objective-C programs is now distributed with GCC.  (This
     does not include any Objective-C classes aside from `object', but see
     "GNUstep" in *Note Forthcoming GNUs::.) G++ seeks to be compliant with
     the ANSI C++ language standard.  See
     `http://www.cygnus.com/misc/wp/index.html' for the latest draft.

     GCC is a fairly portable optimizing compiler which performs many
     optimizations.  They include: automatic register allocation, common
     sub-expression elimination (CSE) (including a certain amount of CSE
     between basic blocks - though not all the supported machine descriptions
     provide for scheduling or delay slots), invariant code motion from
     loops, induction variable optimizations, constant propagation, copy
     propagation, delayed popping of function call arguments, tail recursion
     elimination, integration of inline functions & frame pointer elimination,

     within the World Wide Web environment.  Although it is a genuine
     programming language, suitable for large-scale symbolic manipulation, it
     provides the most commonly wanted Web functionality as built-in
     primitives, so you don't have to write them.

   * `mkisofs'   (SrcCD)
d1435 1
a1435 3
     `mkisofs' is a pre-mastering program to generate an ISO 9660 file system.
     It takes a snapshot of a directory tree, and makes a binary image which
     corresponds to an ISO 9660 file system when written to a block device.
d1437 2
a1438 4
     It can also generate the System Use Sharing Protocol records of the Rock
     Ridge Interchange Protocol (used to further describe the files in an ISO
     9660 file system to a Unix host; it provides information such as longer
     filenames, uid/gid, permissions, and device nodes).
d1440 39
a1478 7
     The `mkisofs' program is often used with `cdwrite'.  The `cdwrite'
     program works by taking the image that `mkisofs' generates and driving a
     cdwriter drive to actually burn the disk.  `cdwrite' works under
     GNU/Linux, and supports popular cdwriter drives.  Older versions of
     `cdwrite' were included with older versions of `mkisofs';
     `sunsite.unc.edu' has the latest version:

     see the CVS item above.

   * `readline'   (BinCD, SrcCD)

     Brian Fox wrote the `readline' library one weekend in 1987, so that the
     FSF would have a clean Emacs-like line editing facility that could be
     used across multiple programs.  After installing it in Bash, he went on
     to test the reusability of the code by adding it to GDB, and then later,
     to the GNU FTP client.  The library supplies many entry points--the
     simplest interface gives any program the ability to store a history of
     input lines, and gives the end user a complete Emacs-like (or vi-like)
     editing capability over the input, simply by replacing calls to `gets'
     with calls to `readline'.

   * `rsync'   (SrcCD)
a2702 6
     `rsync' is a replacement for `rcp' that has many more features.  `rsync'
     uses the "rsync algorithm", which provides a very fast method for
     synchronizing large remote files, sending only the differences across
     the link.  It does not require both versions of a file to be local in
     order to compute the differences.  A technical report describing the
     rsync algorithm is included with the package.

   * `stow'   (SrcCD)

     `stow' manages the installation of multiple software packages, keeping
     them separate while making them appear (via symbolic links) to be
     installed in the same place.  For example, Emacs can be installed in
     `/usr/local/stow/emacs' and Perl in `/usr/local/stow/perl', permitting
     each to be administered separately, while with `stow' they will both
     appear to be installed in `/usr/local'.

a2823 4
     GNU `units' converts between different units of measurement, such as
     miles/gallon to km/liter.  (It can only handle multiplicative scale
     changes, so it cannot convert Celsius to Fahrenheit though it could
     convert temperature differences between those temperatures scales.)

   * xmcd   *Also see* `http://sunsite.unc.edu/~cddb/xmcd/'   (SrcCD)
a3204 4
     `xmcd' is an X11-based CD player utility and `cda' is a command-line
     driven, non-graphical CD audio player.  `xmcd' is developed to use the
     OSF/Motif API (version 1.1 and later) and can also be used with LessTif,
     the free Motif clone.
a3205 9
     In its evolution over the past few years, `xmcd' has established itself
     as the premier CD player application for the X window system with an
     attractive, easy-to-use user interface.  It is feature-rich and runs on
     virtually all of the popular Unix and OpenVMS platforms.  It also
     supports the widest array of CD-ROM and CD-R devices, including some
     older SCSI-1 drives that do not work with other CD player applications.
     The remote CD database query feature fully utilizes the Internet and
     taps on a vast repository of CD artists/titles, track titles and other
     information.  Multi-disc changers are also supported.
d3207 2
a3208 6
     Like many other CD player applications, `xmcd' supports a CD database of
     disc and track titles and other information.  A distinguishing feature
     of `xmcd' is the ability to connect to a remote CD database server to
     query this information.  Many public Internet CD database servers have
     been established around the world for this purpose, and `xmcd' also
     allows the user to submit new CD entries to the master database.

d3246 3
a3248 6
     Zlibc is an uncompressing C library for GNU/Linux and SunOS systems.  It
     is a preloadable shared object that allows executables to uncompress the
     datafiles that they need on the fly.  No kernel patch, no recompilation
     of these executables and no recompilation of the libraries is needed;
     the package overrides the `open' function (and other system call
     functions) in the shared library.

CD-ROMs
*******
d3271 1
a3271 2
We have two series of CD-ROMs: the Source Code CD-ROM, and the Compiler
Tools Binaries CD-ROM.
a3272 4
Our CDs are in ISO 9660 format & can be mounted as a read-only file system on
most computers.  If your driver supports it, you can mount each CD with "Rock
Ridge" extensions & it will look like a regular Unix file system, rather than
one full of truncated & otherwise mangled names that fit vanilla ISO 9660.
a3273 3
You can build most of the software without copying the sources off the CD.
You only need enough disk space for object files and intermediate build
targets.
d3275 2

Pricing of the GNU CD-ROMs
--------------------------
d3285 5
a3289 4
If a business or organization is ultimately paying, the current GNU Source
CD set costs $240.  The set costs $60 if you, an individual, are paying out
of your own pocket.  The current Compiler Tools Binaries CD-ROM costs $220
for a business or organization, and $55 for an individual.
d3291 3
a3293 1
 
d3295 4
a3298 2
What Do the Different Prices Mean?
..................................
d3300 6
a3305 2
The software on our disks is free; anyone can copy it and anyone can run it.
What we charge for is the physical disk and the service of distribution.
a3306 7
We charge two different prices depending on who is buying.  When a company
or other organization buys the Source CD-ROMs, we charge $240.  When an
individual buys the same CD-ROMs, we charge just $60.  This distinction is
not a matter of who is allowed to use the software.  In either case, once
you have a copy, you can distribute as many copies as you wish and there's
no restriction on who can have or run them.  The price distinction is
entirely a matter of what kind of entity pays for the CDs.
a3307 5
You, the reader, are certainly an individual, not a company.  If you are
buying a disk "in person", then you are probably doing so as an individual.
But if you expect to be reimbursed by your employer, then the disk is really
for the company; so please pay the company price and get reimbursed for it.
We won't try to check up on you--we use the honor system--so please cooperate.
d3309 2
a3310 14
Buying CDs at the company price is very helpful for GNU; just
150 Source CDs at that price support an FSF programmer or tech writer for a
year.

 

Why Is There an Individual Price?
.................................

In the past, our distribution tapes were ordered mainly by companies.  The CD
at the price of $240 provides them with all of our software for a much lower
price than they would previously have paid for six different tapes.  To lower
the price more would cut into the FSF's funds very badly and decrease the
software development we can do.
d3312 5
a3316 3
However, for individuals, $240 is too high a price; hardly anyone could
afford that.  So we decided to make CDs available to individuals at the lower
price of $60.
d3318 3
a3320 1
 
d3322 27
a3348 2
Is There a Maximum Price?
.........................
d3350 4
a3353 4
Our stated prices are minimum prices.  Feel free to pay a higher price if you
wish to support GNU development more.  The sky's the limit; we will accept as
high a price as you can offer.  Or simply give a donation (tax-deductible in
the U.S.) to the Free Software Foundation, a tax-exempt public charity.

January 1997 Compiler Tools Binaries CD-ROM
-------------------------------------------
a3367 7
In January 1997 we released the fourth edition of our CD-ROM that has
binaries and complete sources for GNU compiler tools for some systems which
lack a compiler.  This enables the people who use these systems to compile
GNU and other free software without having to buy a proprietary compiler.
You can also use these GNU tools to compile your own C/C++/Objective-C
programs.  Older editions of this CD are available while supplies last at a
reduced price; *Note Free Software Foundation Order Form::.
d3369 2
a3370 4
We hope to have more systems on each update of this CD.  If you can help
build binaries for new systems (especially those that don't come with a C
compiler), or have one to suggest, please contact us at the addresses on page
1.
d3372 14
a3385 1
These packages:
a3386 10
        * DJGPP
        * GCC/G++/Objective-C

Source Code CD-ROMs
-------------------
d3400 1
a3400 1
We have several versions of our Source Code CD-ROMs available, including:
a3401 2
   * July 1997 Source Code CD-ROMs, the newest release, has programs,
     bug fixes, & improvements.  See below.
a3402 1
   * January 1997 Source Code CD-ROMs.

a3416 1
   * May 1994 Source Code CD-ROM.
d3418 1
a3418 1
   * November 1993 Source Code CD-ROM.
d3420 9
a3428 1
   * May 1993 Source Code CD-ROM.
d3430 3
a3432 1
   * October 1992 Source Code CD-ROM.
a3433 4
The older Source CDs are available while supplies last at a reduced price
(please note that the December 1994 Source CD is permanently out of stock).
All the Source CDs have Texinfo source for the GNU manuals listed in *Note
Documentation::.
d3435 1
a3435 2
Much of X11 is *not* on the older Source CDs which are just one CD
instead of two.
d3437 4
a3440 4
There are no precompiled programs on these Source CDs.  You will need a C
compiler (programs which need some other interpreter or compiler normally
provide the C source for a bootstrapping program).  We ship C compiler
binaries for some systems on the *Note Compiler Tools Binaries CD-ROM::.

July 1997 Source Code CD-ROMs
.............................
d3445 2
a3446 180
The 10th edition of our Source Code CD is available now with two CD-ROM disks.
It has programs, bug fixes, & improvements not on the older Source CDs.  It
has these packages, & some manuals that are not part of packages.  The
version number of each package listed might be higher on the 10th edition CD
due to new releases being made since this list was generated.

CD-ROM Subscription Service
***************************

Our subscription service enables you to stay current with the latest GNU
developments.  For a one-time cost equivalent to three Source CD-ROMs (plus
shipping in some cases), we will ship you four new versions of the *Note
Source Code CD-ROMs::.  The CD-ROMs are sent as they are issued (currently
twice a year, but we hope to make it more frequent).  We do not yet know if
we will be offering subscriptions to the Compiler Tools Binaries CD.
d3458 1
a3458 3
A subscription is an easy way to keep up with the regular bug fixes to the X
Window System.  Each edition of the *Note Source Code CD-ROMs::, has updated
sources for the X Window System.
d3460 1
a3460 6
Please note: In two cases, you must pay 4 times the normal shipping required
for a single order when you pay for each subscription.  If you're in Alaska,
Hawaii, or Puerto Rico you must add $20.00 for shipping for each
subscription.  If you're outside of the U.S., Canada, and Puerto Rico, you
must add $80.00 for each subscription.  See "CD-ROMs" and "Tax and Shipping
Costs" on the *note Free Software Foundation Order Form::.

FSF T-shirt
***********
a3465 14
The front of our T-shirt has the GNU Emacs Lisp code `(USE 'GNU)' with "`()'"
being the dancing parentheses from the cover of our `GNU Emacs Lisp Reference
Manual' (drawn by Berkeley, CA artist Etienne Suvasa).  The shirt's back has
the Preamble to the GNU General Public License.

These shirts come in black, natural (off-white), burgundy, and blue-green.
When you order, please give 3 choices.  Black is printed in white and the
other colors are printed in black.  All shirts are thick 100% cotton; black
and burgundy come in sizes M, L, XL, and XXL and the others in sizes L and XL
(they run small so you may want a larger size than usual).

GNU T-shirts often create spontaneous friendships at conferences & on
university campuses.  They also make great gifts for friends & family,
including children!
