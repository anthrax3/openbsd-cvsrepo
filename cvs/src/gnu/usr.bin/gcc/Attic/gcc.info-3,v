@First cut at making a minimal intrusive munge of gcc to fit in a BSD
framework.  This means, provide a Makefile.bsd-wrapper.  Remove
intermediate files from the source dir.  Build them in the obj-dir.
Add some Makefile hooks so we can tune the std Makefile for our
purpose but still have it behave normal for out-of-tree
configurations.  Only i386 is supported for now.  The other archs will
follow soon.   This checkin requires an existing makeinfo and a yacc
that accepts -o.

Options to Request or Suppress Warnings
=======================================

   Warnings are diagnostic messages that report constructions which are
not inherently erroneous but which are risky or suggest there may have
been an error.

   You can request many specific warnings with options beginning `-W',
for example `-Wimplicit' to request warnings on implicit declarations.
Each of these specific warning options also has a negative form
beginning `-Wno-' to turn off warnings; for example, `-Wno-implicit'.
This manual lists only one of the two forms, whichever is not the
default.

   These options control the amount and kinds of warnings produced by
GNU CC:

`-fsyntax-only'
     Check the code for syntax errors, but don't do anything beyond
     that.

`-pedantic'
     Issue all the warnings demanded by strict ANSI standard C; reject
     all programs that use forbidden extensions.

     Valid ANSI standard C programs should compile properly with or
     without this option (though a rare few will require `-ansi').
     However, without this option, certain GNU extensions and
     traditional C features are supported as well.  With this option,
     they are rejected.

     `-pedantic' does not cause warning messages for use of the
     alternate keywords whose names begin and end with `__'.  Pedantic
     warnings are also disabled in the expression that follows
     `__extension__'.  However, only system header files should use
     these escape routes; application programs should avoid them.
     *Note Alternate Keywords::.

     This option is not intended to be useful; it exists only to satisfy
     pedants who would otherwise claim that GNU CC fails to support the
     ANSI standard.

     Some users try to use `-pedantic' to check programs for strict ANSI
     C conformance.  They soon find that it does not do quite what they
     want: it finds some non-ANSI practices, but not all--only those
     for which ANSI C *requires* a diagnostic.

     A feature to report any failure to conform to ANSI C might be
     useful in some instances, but would require considerable
     additional work and would be quite different from `-pedantic'.  We
     recommend, rather, that users take advantage of the extensions of
     GNU C and disregard the limitations of other compilers.  Aside
     from certain supercomputers and obsolete small machines, there is
     less and less reason ever to use any other C compiler other than
     for bootstrapping GNU CC.

`-pedantic-errors'
     Like `-pedantic', except that errors are produced rather than
     warnings.

`-w'
     Inhibit all warning messages.

`-Wno-import'
     Inhibit warning messages about the use of `#import'.

`-Wchar-subscripts'
     Warn if an array subscript has type `char'.  This is a common cause
     of error, as programmers often forget that this type is signed on
     some machines.

`-Wcomment'
     Warn whenever a comment-start sequence `/*' appears in a comment.

`-Wformat'
     Check calls to `printf' and `scanf', etc., to make sure that the
     arguments supplied have types appropriate to the format string
     specified.

`-Wimplicit'
     Warn whenever a function or parameter is implicitly declared.

`-Wparentheses'
     Warn if parentheses are omitted in certain contexts, such as when
     there is an assignment in a context where a truth value is
     expected, or when operators are nested whose precedence people
     often get confused about.

`-Wreturn-type'
     Warn whenever a function is defined with a return-type that
     defaults to `int'.  Also warn about any `return' statement with no
     return-value in a function whose return-type is not `void'.

`-Wswitch'
     Warn whenever a `switch' statement has an index of enumeral type
     and lacks a `case' for one or more of the named codes of that
     enumeration.  (The presence of a `default' label prevents this
     warning.)  `case' labels outside the enumeration range also
     provoke warnings when this option is used.

`-Wtrigraphs'
     Warn if any trigraphs are encountered (assuming they are enabled).

`-Wunused'
     Warn whenever a variable is unused aside from its declaration,
     whenever a function is declared static but never defined, whenever
     a label is declared but not used, and whenever a statement
     computes a result that is explicitly not used.

     To suppress this warning for an expression, simply cast it to
     void.  For unused variables and parameters, use the `unused'
     attribute (*note Variable Attributes::.).

`-Wuninitialized'
     An automatic variable is used without first being initialized.

     These warnings are possible only in optimizing compilation,
     because they require data flow information that is computed only
     when optimizing.  If you don't specify `-O', you simply won't get
     these warnings.

     These warnings occur only for variables that are candidates for
     register allocation.  Therefore, they do not occur for a variable
     that is declared `volatile', or whose address is taken, or whose
     size is other than 1, 2, 4 or 8 bytes.  Also, they do not occur for
     structures, unions or arrays, even when they are in registers.

     Note that there may be no warning about a variable that is used
     only to compute a value that itself is never used, because such
     computations may be deleted by data flow analysis before the
     warnings are printed.

     These warnings are made optional because GNU CC is not smart
     enough to see all the reasons why the code might be correct
     despite appearing to have an error.  Here is one example of how
     this can happen:

          {
            int x;
            switch (y)
              {
              case 1: x = 1;
                break;
              case 2: x = 4;
                break;
              case 3: x = 5;
              }
            foo (x);
          }

     If the value of `y' is always 1, 2 or 3, then `x' is always
     initialized, but GNU CC doesn't know this.  Here is another common
     case:

          {
            int save_y;
            if (change_y) save_y = y, y = new_y;
            ...
            if (change_y) y = save_y;
          }

     This has no bug because `save_y' is used only if it is set.

     Some spurious warnings can be avoided if you declare all the
     functions you use that never return as `noreturn'.  *Note Function
     Attributes::.

`-Wenum-clash'
     Warn about conversion between different enumeration types.  (C++
     only).

`-Wreorder (C++ only)'
     Warn when the order of member initializers given in the code does
     not match the order in which they must be executed.  For instance:

          struct A {
            int i;
            int j;
            A(): j (0), i (1) { }
          };

     Here the compiler will warn that the member initializers for `i'
     and `j' will be rearranged to match the declaration order of the
     members.

`-Wtemplate-debugging'
     When using templates in a C++ program, warn if debugging is not yet
     fully available (C++ only).

`-Wall'
     All of the above `-W' options combined.  These are all the options
     which pertain to usage that we recommend avoiding and that we
     believe is easy to avoid, even in conjunction with macros.

   The remaining `-W...' options are not implied by `-Wall' because
they warn about constructions that we consider reasonable to use, on
occasion, in clean programs.

`-W'
     Print extra warning messages for these events:

        * A nonvolatile automatic variable might be changed by a call to
          `longjmp'.  These warnings as well are possible only in
          optimizing compilation.

          The compiler sees only the calls to `setjmp'.  It cannot know
          where `longjmp' will be called; in fact, a signal handler
          could call it at any point in the code.  As a result, you may
          get a warning even when there is in fact no problem because
          `longjmp' cannot in fact be called at the place which would
          cause a problem.

        * A function can return either with or without a value.
          (Falling off the end of the function body is considered
          returning without a value.)  For example, this function would
          evoke such a warning:

               foo (a)
               {
                 if (a > 0)
                   return a;
               }

        * An expression-statement or the left-hand side of a comma
          expression contains no side effects.  To suppress the
          warning, cast the unused expression to void.  For example, an
          expression such as `x[i,j]' will cause a warning, but
          `x[(void)i,j]' will not.

        * An unsigned value is compared against zero with `<' or `<='.

        * A comparison like `x<=y<=z' appears; this is equivalent to
          `(x<=y ? 1 : 0) <= z', which is a different interpretation
          from that of ordinary mathematical notation.

        * Storage-class specifiers like `static' are not the first
          things in a declaration.  According to the C Standard, this
          usage is obsolescent.

        * If `-Wall' or `-Wunused' is also specified, warn about unused
          arguments.

        * An aggregate has a partly bracketed initializer.  For
          example, the following code would evoke such a warning,
          because braces are missing around the initializer for `x.h':

               struct s { int f, g; };
               struct t { struct s h; int i; };
               struct t x = { 1, 2, 3 };

`-Wtraditional'
     Warn about certain constructs that behave differently in
     traditional and ANSI C.

        * Macro arguments occurring within string constants in the
          macro body.  These would substitute the argument in
          traditional C, but are part of the constant in ANSI C.

        * A function declared external in one block and then used after
          the end of the block.

        * A `switch' statement has an operand of type `long'.

`-Wshadow'
     Warn whenever a local variable shadows another local variable.

`-Wid-clash-LEN'
     Warn whenever two distinct identifiers match in the first LEN
     characters.  This may help you prepare a program that will compile
     with certain obsolete, brain-damaged compilers.

`-Wlarger-than-LEN'
     Warn whenever an object of larger than LEN bytes is defined.

`-Wpointer-arith'
     Warn about anything that depends on the "size of" a function type
     or of `void'.  GNU C assigns these types a size of 1, for
     convenience in calculations with `void *' pointers and pointers to
     functions.

`-Wbad-function-cast'
     Warn whenever a function call is cast to a non-matching type.  For
     example, warn if `int malloc()' is cast to `anything *'.

`-Wcast-qual'
     Warn whenever a pointer is cast so as to remove a type qualifier
     from the target type.  For example, warn if a `const char *' is
     cast to an ordinary `char *'.

`-Wcast-align'
     Warn whenever a pointer is cast such that the required alignment
     of the target is increased.  For example, warn if a `char *' is
     cast to an `int *' on machines where integers can only be accessed
     at two- or four-byte boundaries.

`-Wwrite-strings'
     Give string constants the type `const char[LENGTH]' so that
     copying the address of one into a non-`const' `char *' pointer
     will get a warning.  These warnings will help you find at compile
     time code that can try to write into a string constant, but only
     if you have been very careful about using `const' in declarations
     and prototypes.  Otherwise, it will just be a nuisance; this is
     why we did not make `-Wall' request these warnings.

`-Wconversion'
     Warn if a prototype causes a type conversion that is different
     from what would happen to the same argument in the absence of a
     prototype.  This includes conversions of fixed point to floating
     and vice versa, and conversions changing the width or signedness
     of a fixed point argument except when the same as the default
     promotion.

     Also, warn if a negative integer constant expression is implicitly
     converted to an unsigned type.  For example, warn about the
     assignment `x = -1' if `x' is unsigned.  But do not warn about
     explicit casts like `(unsigned) -1'.

`-Waggregate-return'
     Warn if any functions that return structures or unions are defined
     or called.  (In languages where you can return an array, this also
     elicits a warning.)

`-Wstrict-prototypes'
     Warn if a function is declared or defined without specifying the
     argument types.  (An old-style function definition is permitted
     without a warning if preceded by a declaration which specifies the
     argument types.)

`-Wmissing-prototypes'
     Warn if a global function is defined without a previous prototype
     declaration.  This warning is issued even if the definition itself
     provides a prototype.  The aim is to detect global functions that
     fail to be declared in header files.

`-Wmissing-declarations'
     Warn if a global function is defined without a previous
     declaration.  Do so even if the definition itself provides a
     prototype.  Use this option to detect global functions that are
     not declared in header files.

`-Wredundant-decls'
     Warn if anything is declared more than once in the same scope,
     even in cases where multiple declaration is valid and changes
     nothing.

`-Wnested-externs'
     Warn if an `extern' declaration is encountered within an function.

`-Winline'
     Warn if a function can not be inlined, and either it was declared
     as inline, or else the `-finline-functions' option was given.

`-Woverloaded-virtual'
     Warn when a derived class function declaration may be an error in
     defining a virtual function (C++ only).  In a derived class, the
     definitions of virtual functions must match the type signature of a
     virtual function declared in the base class.  With this option, the
     compiler warns when you define a function with the same name as a
     virtual function, but with a type signature that does not match any
     declarations from the base class.

`-Wsynth (C++ only)'
     Warn when g++'s synthesis behavior does not match that of cfront.
     For instance:

          struct A {
            operator int ();
            A& operator = (int);
          };
          
          main ()
          {
            A a,b;
            a = b;
          }

     In this example, g++ will synthesize a default `A& operator =
     (const A&);', while cfront will use the user-defined `operator ='.

`-Werror'
     Make all warnings into errors.

Options for Debugging Your Program or GNU CC
============================================

   GNU CC has various special options that are used for debugging
either your program or GCC:

`-g'
     Produce debugging information in the operating system's native
     format (stabs, COFF, XCOFF, or DWARF).  GDB can work with this
     debugging information.

     On most systems that use stabs format, `-g' enables use of extra
     debugging information that only GDB can use; this extra information
     makes debugging work better in GDB but will probably make other
     debuggers crash or refuse to read the program.  If you want to
     control for certain whether to generate the extra information, use
     `-gstabs+', `-gstabs', `-gxcoff+', `-gxcoff', `-gdwarf+', or
     `-gdwarf' (see below).

     Unlike most other C compilers, GNU CC allows you to use `-g' with
     `-O'.  The shortcuts taken by optimized code may occasionally
     produce surprising results: some variables you declared may not
     exist at all; flow of control may briefly move where you did not
     expect it; some statements may not be executed because they
     compute constant results or their values were already at hand;
     some statements may execute in different places because they were
     moved out of loops.

     Nevertheless it proves possible to debug optimized output.  This
     makes it reasonable to use the optimizer for programs that might
     have bugs.

     The following options are useful when GNU CC is generated with the
     capability for more than one debugging format.

`-ggdb'
     Produce debugging information in the native format (if that is
     supported), including GDB extensions if at all possible.

`-gstabs'
     Produce debugging information in stabs format (if that is
     supported), without GDB extensions.  This is the format used by
     DBX on most BSD systems.  On MIPS, Alpha and System V Release 4
     systems this option produces stabs debugging output which is not
     understood by DBX or SDB.  On System V Release 4 systems this
     option requires the GNU assembler.

`-gstabs+'
     Produce debugging information in stabs format (if that is
     supported), using GNU extensions understood only by the GNU
     debugger (GDB).  The use of these extensions is likely to make
     other debuggers crash or refuse to read the program.

`-gcoff'
     Produce debugging information in COFF format (if that is
     supported).  This is the format used by SDB on most System V
     systems prior to System V Release 4.

`-gxcoff'
     Produce debugging information in XCOFF format (if that is
     supported).  This is the format used by the DBX debugger on IBM
     RS/6000 systems.

`-gxcoff+'
     Produce debugging information in XCOFF format (if that is
     supported), using GNU extensions understood only by the GNU
     debugger (GDB).  The use of these extensions is likely to make
     other debuggers crash or refuse to read the program, and may cause
     assemblers other than the GNU assembler (GAS) to fail with an
     error.

`-gdwarf'
     Produce debugging information in DWARF format (if that is
     supported).  This is the format used by SDB on most System V
     Release 4 systems.

`-gdwarf+'
     Produce debugging information in DWARF format (if that is
     supported), using GNU extensions understood only by the GNU
     debugger (GDB).  The use of these extensions is likely to make
     other debuggers crash or refuse to read the program.

`-gLEVEL'
`-ggdbLEVEL'
`-gstabsLEVEL'
`-gcoffLEVEL'
`-gxcoffLEVEL'
`-gdwarfLEVEL'
     Request debugging information and also use LEVEL to specify how
     much information.  The default level is 2.

     Level 1 produces minimal information, enough for making backtraces
     in parts of the program that you don't plan to debug.  This
     includes descriptions of functions and external variables, but no
     information about local variables and no line numbers.

     Level 3 includes extra information, such as all the macro
     definitions present in the program.  Some debuggers support macro
     expansion when you use `-g3'.

`-p'
     Generate extra code to write profile information suitable for the
     analysis program `prof'.  You must use this option when compiling
     the source files you want data about, and you must also use it when
     linking.

`-pg'
     Generate extra code to write profile information suitable for the
     analysis program `gprof'.  You must use this option when compiling
     the source files you want data about, and you must also use it when
     linking.

`-a'
     Generate extra code to write profile information for basic blocks,
     which will record the number of times each basic block is
     executed, the basic block start address, and the function name
     containing the basic block.  If `-g' is used, the line number and
     filename of the start of the basic block will also be recorded.
     If not overridden by the machine description, the default action is
     to append to the text file `bb.out'.

     This data could be analyzed by a program like `tcov'.  Note,
     however, that the format of the data is not what `tcov' expects.
     Eventually GNU `gprof' should be extended to process this data.

`-dLETTERS'
     Says to make debugging dumps during compilation at times specified
     by LETTERS.  This is used for debugging the compiler.  The file
     names for most of the dumps are made by appending a word to the
     source file name (e.g.  `foo.c.rtl' or `foo.c.jump').  Here are the
     possible letters for use in LETTERS, and their meanings:

    `M'
          Dump all macro definitions, at the end of preprocessing, and
          write no output.

    `N'
          Dump all macro names, at the end of preprocessing.

    `D'
          Dump all macro definitions, at the end of preprocessing, in
          addition to normal output.

    `y'
          Dump debugging information during parsing, to standard error.

    `r'
          Dump after RTL generation, to `FILE.rtl'.

    `x'
          Just generate RTL for a function instead of compiling it.
          Usually used with `r'.

    `j'
          Dump after first jump optimization, to `FILE.jump'.

    `s'
          Dump after CSE (including the jump optimization that sometimes
          follows CSE), to `FILE.cse'.

    `L'
          Dump after loop optimization, to `FILE.loop'.

    `t'
          Dump after the second CSE pass (including the jump
          optimization that sometimes follows CSE), to `FILE.cse2'.

    `f'
          Dump after flow analysis, to `FILE.flow'.

    `c'
          Dump after instruction combination, to the file
          `FILE.combine'.

    `S'
          Dump after the first instruction scheduling pass, to
          `FILE.sched'.

    `l'
          Dump after local register allocation, to `FILE.lreg'.

    `g'
          Dump after global register allocation, to `FILE.greg'.

    `R'
          Dump after the second instruction scheduling pass, to
          `FILE.sched2'.

    `J'
          Dump after last jump optimization, to `FILE.jump2'.

    `d'
          Dump after delayed branch scheduling, to `FILE.dbr'.

    `k'
          Dump after conversion from registers to stack, to
          `FILE.stack'.

    `a'
          Produce all the dumps listed above.

    `m'
          Print statistics on memory usage, at the end of the run, to
          standard error.

    `p'
          Annotate the assembler output with a comment indicating which
          pattern and alternative was used.

`-fpretend-float'
     When running a cross-compiler, pretend that the target machine
     uses the same floating point format as the host machine.  This
     causes incorrect output of the actual floating constants, but the
     actual instruction sequence will probably be the same as GNU CC
     would make when running on the target machine.

`-save-temps'
     Store the usual "temporary" intermediate files permanently; place
     them in the current directory and name them based on the source
     file.  Thus, compiling `foo.c' with `-c -save-temps' would produce
     files `foo.i' and `foo.s', as well as `foo.o'.

`-print-file-name=LIBRARY'
     Print the full absolute name of the library file LIBRARY that
     would be used when linking--and don't do anything else.  With this
     option, GNU CC does not compile or link anything; it just prints
     the file name.

`-print-prog-name=PROGRAM'
     Like `-print-file-name', but searches for a program such as `cpp'.

`-print-libgcc-file-name'
     Same as `-print-file-name=libgcc.a'.

     This is useful when you use `-nostdlib' or `-nodefaultlibs' but
     you do want to link with `libgcc.a'.  You can do

          gcc -nostdlib FILES... `gcc -print-libgcc-file-name`

`-print-search-dirs'
     Print the name of the configured installation directory and a list
     of program and library directories gcc will search--and don't do
     anything else.

     This is useful when gcc prints the error message `installation
     problem, cannot exec cpp: No such file or directory'.  To resolve
     this you either need to put `cpp' and the other compiler
     components where gcc expects to find them, or you can set the
     environment variable `GCC_EXEC_PREFIX' to the directory where you
     installed them.  Don't forget the trailing '/'.  *Note Environment
     Variables::.

Options That Control Optimization
=================================

   These options control various sorts of optimizations:

`-O'
`-O1'
     Optimize.  Optimizing compilation takes somewhat more time, and a
     lot more memory for a large function.

     Without `-O', the compiler's goal is to reduce the cost of
     compilation and to make debugging produce the expected results.
     Statements are independent: if you stop the program with a
     breakpoint between statements, you can then assign a new value to
     any variable or change the program counter to any other statement
     in the function and get exactly the results you would expect from
     the source code.

     Without `-O', the compiler only allocates variables declared
     `register' in registers.  The resulting compiled code is a little
     worse than produced by PCC without `-O'.

     With `-O', the compiler tries to reduce code size and execution
     time.

     When you specify `-O', the compiler turns on `-fthread-jumps' and
     `-fdefer-pop' on all machines.  The compiler turns on
     `-fdelayed-branch' on machines that have delay slots, and
     `-fomit-frame-pointer' on machines that can support debugging even
     without a frame pointer.  On some machines the compiler also turns
     on other flags.

`-O2'
     Optimize even more.  GNU CC performs nearly all supported
     optimizations that do not involve a space-speed tradeoff.  The
     compiler does not perform loop unrolling or function inlining when
     you specify `-O2'.  As compared to `-O', this option increases
     both compilation time and the performance of the generated code.

     `-O2' turns on all optional optimizations except for loop unrolling
     and function inlining.  It also turns on the `-fforce-mem' option
     on all machines and frame pointer elimination on machines where
     doing so does not interfere with debugging.

`-O3'
     Optimize yet more.  `-O3' turns on all optimizations specified by
     `-O2' and also turns on the `inline-functions' option.

`-O0'
     Do not optimize.

     If you use multiple `-O' options, with or without level numbers,
     the last such option is the one that is effective.

   Options of the form `-fFLAG' specify machine-independent flags.
Most flags have both positive and negative forms; the negative form of
`-ffoo' would be `-fno-foo'.  In the table below, only one of the forms
is listed--the one which is not the default.  You can figure out the
other form by either removing `no-' or adding it.

`-ffloat-store'
     Do not store floating point variables in registers, and inhibit
     other options that might change whether a floating point value is
     taken from a register or memory.

     This option prevents undesirable excess precision on machines such
     as the 68000 where the floating registers (of the 68881) keep more
     precision than a `double' is supposed to have.  For most programs,
     the excess precision does only good, but a few programs rely on the
     precise definition of IEEE floating point.  Use `-ffloat-store' for
     such programs.

`-fno-default-inline'
     Do not make member functions inline by default merely because they
     are defined inside the class scope (C++ only).  Otherwise, when
     you specify `-O', member functions defined inside class scope are
     compiled inline by default; i.e., you don't need to add `inline'
     in front of the member function name.

`-fno-defer-pop'
     Always pop the arguments to each function call as soon as that
     function returns.  For machines which must pop arguments after a
     function call, the compiler normally lets arguments accumulate on
     the stack for several function calls and pops them all at once.

`-fforce-mem'
     Force memory operands to be copied into registers before doing
     arithmetic on them.  This produces better code by making all memory
     references potential common subexpressions.  When they are not
     common subexpressions, instruction combination should eliminate
     the separate register-load.  The `-O2' option turns on this option.

`-fforce-addr'
     Force memory address constants to be copied into registers before
     doing arithmetic on them.  This may produce better code just as
     `-fforce-mem' may.

`-fomit-frame-pointer'
     Don't keep the frame pointer in a register for functions that
     don't need one.  This avoids the instructions to save, set up and
     restore frame pointers; it also makes an extra register available
     in many functions.  *It also makes debugging impossible on some
     machines.*

     On some machines, such as the Vax, this flag has no effect, because
     the standard calling sequence automatically handles the frame
     pointer and nothing is saved by pretending it doesn't exist.  The
     machine-description macro `FRAME_POINTER_REQUIRED' controls
     whether a target machine supports this flag.  *Note Registers::.

`-fno-inline'
     Don't pay attention to the `inline' keyword.  Normally this option
     is used to keep the compiler from expanding any functions inline.
     Note that if you are not optimizing, no functions can be expanded
     inline.

`-finline-functions'
     Integrate all simple functions into their callers.  The compiler
     heuristically decides which functions are simple enough to be worth
     integrating in this way.

     If all calls to a given function are integrated, and the function
     is declared `static', then the function is normally not output as
     assembler code in its own right.

`-fkeep-inline-functions'
     Even if all calls to a given function are integrated, and the
     function is declared `static', nevertheless output a separate
     run-time callable version of the function.

`-fno-function-cse'
     Do not put function addresses in registers; make each instruction
     that calls a constant function contain the function's address
     explicitly.

     This option results in less efficient code, but some strange hacks
     that alter the assembler output may be confused by the
     optimizations performed when this option is not used.

`-ffast-math'
     This option allows GCC to violate some ANSI or IEEE rules and/or
     specifications in the interest of optimizing code for speed.  For
     example, it allows the compiler to assume arguments to the `sqrt'
     function are non-negative numbers and that no floating-point values
     are NaNs.

     This option should never be turned on by any `-O' option since it
     can result in incorrect output for programs which depend on an
     exact implementation of IEEE or ANSI rules/specifications for math
     functions.

   The following options control specific optimizations.  The `-O2'
option turns on all of these optimizations except `-funroll-loops' and
`-funroll-all-loops'.  On most machines, the `-O' option turns on the
`-fthread-jumps' and `-fdelayed-branch' options, but specific machines
may handle it differently.

   You can use the following flags in the rare cases when "fine-tuning"
of optimizations to be performed is desired.

`-fstrength-reduce'
     Perform the optimizations of loop strength reduction and
     elimination of iteration variables.

`-fthread-jumps'
     Perform optimizations where we check to see if a jump branches to a
     location where another comparison subsumed by the first is found.
     If so, the first branch is redirected to either the destination of
     the second branch or a point immediately following it, depending
     on whether the condition is known to be true or false.

`-fcse-follow-jumps'
     In common subexpression elimination, scan through jump instructions
     when the target of the jump is not reached by any other path.  For
     example, when CSE encounters an `if' statement with an `else'
     clause, CSE will follow the jump when the condition tested is
     false.

`-fcse-skip-blocks'
     This is similar to `-fcse-follow-jumps', but causes CSE to follow
     jumps which conditionally skip over blocks.  When CSE encounters a
     simple `if' statement with no else clause, `-fcse-skip-blocks'
     causes CSE to follow the jump around the body of the `if'.

`-frerun-cse-after-loop'
     Re-run common subexpression elimination after loop optimizations
     has been performed.

`-fexpensive-optimizations'
     Perform a number of minor optimizations that are relatively
     expensive.

`-fdelayed-branch'
     If supported for the target machine, attempt to reorder
     instructions to exploit instruction slots available after delayed
     branch instructions.

`-fschedule-insns'
     If supported for the target machine, attempt to reorder
     instructions to eliminate execution stalls due to required data
     being unavailable.  This helps machines that have slow floating
     point or memory load instructions by allowing other instructions
     to be issued until the result of the load or floating point
     instruction is required.

`-fschedule-insns2'
     Similar to `-fschedule-insns', but requests an additional pass of
     instruction scheduling after register allocation has been done.
     This is especially useful on machines with a relatively small
     number of registers and where memory load instructions take more
     than one cycle.

`-fcaller-saves'
     Enable values to be allocated in registers that will be clobbered
     by function calls, by emitting extra instructions to save and
     restore the registers around such calls.  Such allocation is done
     only when it seems to result in better code than would otherwise
     be produced.

     This option is enabled by default on certain machines, usually
     those which have no call-preserved registers to use instead.

`-funroll-loops'
     Perform the optimization of loop unrolling.  This is only done for
     loops whose number of iterations can be determined at compile time
     or run time.  `-funroll-loop' implies both `-fstrength-reduce' and
     `-frerun-cse-after-loop'.

`-funroll-all-loops'
     Perform the optimization of loop unrolling.  This is done for all
     loops and usually makes programs run more slowly.
     `-funroll-all-loops' implies `-fstrength-reduce' as well as
     `-frerun-cse-after-loop'.

`-fno-peephole'
     Disable any machine-specific peephole optimizations.

Options Controlling the Preprocessor
====================================

   These options control the C preprocessor, which is run on each C
source file before actual compilation.

   If you use the `-E' option, nothing is done except preprocessing.
Some of these options make sense only together with `-E' because they
cause the preprocessor output to be unsuitable for actual compilation.

`-include FILE'
     Process FILE as input before processing the regular input file.
     In effect, the contents of FILE are compiled first.  Any `-D' and
     `-U' options on the command line are always processed before
     `-include FILE', regardless of the order in which they are
     written.  All the `-include' and `-imacros' options are processed
     in the order in which they are written.

`-imacros FILE'
     Process FILE as input, discarding the resulting output, before
     processing the regular input file.  Because the output generated
     from FILE is discarded, the only effect of `-imacros FILE' is to
     make the macros defined in FILE available for use in the main
     input.

     Any `-D' and `-U' options on the command line are always processed
     before `-imacros FILE', regardless of the order in which they are
     written.  All the `-include' and `-imacros' options are processed
     in the order in which they are written.

`-idirafter DIR'
     Add the directory DIR to the second include path.  The directories
     on the second include path are searched when a header file is not
     found in any of the directories in the main include path (the one
     that `-I' adds to).

`-iprefix PREFIX'
     Specify PREFIX as the prefix for subsequent `-iwithprefix' options.

`-iwithprefix DIR'
     Add a directory to the second include path.  The directory's name
     is made by concatenating PREFIX and DIR, where PREFIX was
     specified previously with `-iprefix'.  If you have not specified a
     prefix yet, the directory containing the installed passes of the
     compiler is used as the default.

`-iwithprefixbefore DIR'
     Add a directory to the main include path.  The directory's name is
     made by concatenating PREFIX and DIR, as in the case of
     `-iwithprefix'.

`-isystem DIR'
     Add a directory to the beginning of the second include path,
     marking it as a system directory, so that it gets the same special
     treatment as is applied to the standard system directories.

`-nostdinc'
     Do not search the standard system directories for header files.
     Only the directories you have specified with `-I' options (and the
     current directory, if appropriate) are searched.  *Note Directory
     Options::, for information on `-I'.

     By using both `-nostdinc' and `-I-', you can limit the include-file
     search path to only those directories you specify explicitly.

`-undef'
     Do not predefine any nonstandard macros.  (Including architecture
     flags).

`-E'
     Run only the C preprocessor.  Preprocess all the C source files
     specified and output the results to standard output or to the
     specified output file.

`-C'
     Tell the preprocessor not to discard comments.  Used with the `-E'
     option.

`-P'
     Tell the preprocessor not to generate `#line' directives.  Used
     with the `-E' option.

`-M'
     Tell the preprocessor to output a rule suitable for `make'
     describing the dependencies of each object file.  For each source
     file, the preprocessor outputs one `make'-rule whose target is the
     object file name for that source file and whose dependencies are
     all the `#include' header files it uses.  This rule may be a
     single line or may be continued with `\'-newline if it is long.
     The list of rules is printed on standard output instead of the
     preprocessed C program.

     `-M' implies `-E'.

     Another way to specify output of a `make' rule is by setting the
     environment variable `DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT' (*note Environment
     Variables::.).

`-MM'
     Like `-M' but the output mentions only the user header files
     included with `#include "FILE"'.  System header files included
     with `#include <FILE>' are omitted.

`-MD'
     Like `-M' but the dependency information is written to a file made
     by replacing ".c" with ".d" at the end of the input file names.
     This is in addition to compiling the file as specified--`-MD' does
     not inhibit ordinary compilation the way `-M' does.

     In Mach, you can use the utility `md' to merge multiple dependency
     files into a single dependency file suitable for using with the
     `make' command.

`-MMD'
     Like `-MD' except mention only user header files, not system
     header files.

`-MG'
     Treat missing header files as generated files and assume they live
     in the same directory as the source file.  If you specify `-MG',
     you must also specify either `-M' or `-MM'.  `-MG' is not
     supported with `-MD' or `-MMD'.

`-H'
     Print the name of each header file used, in addition to other
     normal activities.

`-AQUESTION(ANSWER)'
     Assert the answer ANSWER for QUESTION, in case it is tested with a
     preprocessing conditional such as `#if #QUESTION(ANSWER)'.  `-A-'
     disables the standard assertions that normally describe the target
     machine.

`-DMACRO'
     Define macro MACRO with the string `1' as its definition.

`-DMACRO=DEFN'
     Define macro MACRO as DEFN.  All instances of `-D' on the command
     line are processed before any `-U' options.

`-UMACRO'
     Undefine macro MACRO.  `-U' options are evaluated after all `-D'
     options, but before any `-include' and `-imacros' options.

`-dM'
     Tell the preprocessor to output only a list of the macro
     definitions that are in effect at the end of preprocessing.  Used
     with the `-E' option.

`-dD'
     Tell the preprocessing to pass all macro definitions into the
     output, in their proper sequence in the rest of the output.

`-dN'
     Like `-dD' except that the macro arguments and contents are
     omitted.  Only `#define NAME' is included in the output.

`-trigraphs'
     Support ANSI C trigraphs.  The `-ansi' option also has this effect.

`-Wp,OPTION'
     Pass OPTION as an option to the preprocessor.  If OPTION contains
     commas, it is split into multiple options at the commas.

Passing Options to the Assembler
================================

   You can pass options to the assembler.

`-Wa,OPTION'
     Pass OPTION as an option to the assembler.  If OPTION contains
     commas, it is split into multiple options at the commas.


File: gcc.info,  Node: Link Options,  Next: Directory Options,  Prev: Assembler Options,  Up: Invoking GCC

Options for Linking
===================

   These options come into play when the compiler links object files
into an executable output file.  They are meaningless if the compiler is
not doing a link step.

`OBJECT-FILE-NAME'
     A file name that does not end in a special recognized suffix is
     considered to name an object file or library.  (Object files are
     distinguished from libraries by the linker according to the file
     contents.)  If linking is done, these object files are used as
     input to the linker.

`-c'
`-S'
`-E'
     If any of these options is used, then the linker is not run, and
     object file names should not be used as arguments.  *Note Overall
     Options::.

`-lLIBRARY'
     Search the library named LIBRARY when linking.

     It makes a difference where in the command you write this option;
     the linker searches processes libraries and object files in the
     order they are specified.  Thus, `foo.o -lz bar.o' searches
     library `z' after file `foo.o' but before `bar.o'.  If `bar.o'
     refers to functions in `z', those functions may not be loaded.

     The linker searches a standard list of directories for the library,
     which is actually a file named `libLIBRARY.a'.  The linker then
     uses this file as if it had been specified precisely by name.

     The directories searched include several standard system
     directories plus any that you specify with `-L'.

     Normally the files found this way are library files--archive files
     whose members are object files.  The linker handles an archive
     file by scanning through it for members which define symbols that
     have so far been referenced but not defined.  But if the file that
     is found is an ordinary object file, it is linked in the usual
     fashion.  The only difference between using an `-l' option and
     specifying a file name is that `-l' surrounds LIBRARY with `lib'
     and `.a' and searches several directories.

`-lobjc'
     You need this special case of the `-l' option in order to link an
     Objective C program.

`-nostartfiles'
     Do not use the standard system startup files when linking.  The
     standard system libraries are used normally, unless `-nostdlib' or
     `-nodefaultlibs' is used.

`-nodefaultlibs'
     Do not use the standard system libraries when linking.  Only the
     libraries you specify will be passed to the linker.  The standard
     startup files are used normally, unless `-nostartfiles' is used.

`-nostdlib'
     Do not use the standard system startup files or libraries when
     linking.  No startup files and only the libraries you specify will
     be passed to the linker.

     One of the standard libraries bypassed by `-nostdlib' and
     `-nodefaultlibs' is `libgcc.a', a library of internal subroutines
     that GNU CC uses to overcome shortcomings of particular machines,
     or special needs for some languages.  (*Note Interfacing to GNU CC
     Output: Interface, for more discussion of `libgcc.a'.) In most
     cases, you need `libgcc.a' even when you want to avoid other
     standard libraries.  In other words, when you specify `-nostdlib'
     or `-nodefaultlibs' you should usually specify `-lgcc' as well.
     This ensures that you have no unresolved references to internal
     GNU CC library subroutines.  (For example, `__main', used to
     ensure C++ constructors will be called; *note `collect2':
     Collect2..)

`-s'
     Remove all symbol table and relocation information from the
     executable.

`-static'
     On systems that support dynamic linking, this prevents linking
     with the shared libraries.  On other systems, this option has no
     effect.

`-shared'
     Produce a shared object which can then be linked with other
     objects to form an executable.  Only a few systems support this
     option.

`-symbolic'
     Bind references to global symbols when building a shared object.
     Warn about any unresolved references (unless overridden by the
     link editor option `-Xlinker -z -Xlinker defs').  Only a few
     systems support this option.

`-Xlinker OPTION'
     Pass OPTION as an option to the linker.  You can use this to
     supply system-specific linker options which GNU CC does not know
     how to recognize.

     If you want to pass an option that takes an argument, you must use
     `-Xlinker' twice, once for the option and once for the argument.
     For example, to pass `-assert definitions', you must write
     `-Xlinker -assert -Xlinker definitions'.  It does not work to write
     `-Xlinker "-assert definitions"', because this passes the entire
     string as a single argument, which is not what the linker expects.

`-Wl,OPTION'
     Pass OPTION as an option to the linker.  If OPTION contains
     commas, it is split into multiple options at the commas.

`-u SYMBOL'
     Pretend the symbol SYMBOL is undefined, to force linking of
     library modules to define it.  You can use `-u' multiple times with
     different symbols to force loading of additional library modules.

Options for Directory Search
============================

   These options specify directories to search for header files, for
libraries and for parts of the compiler:

`-IDIR'
     Add the directory DIR to the head of the list of directories to be
     searched for header files.  This can be used to override a system
     header file, substituting your own version, since these
     directories are searched before the system header file
     directories.  If you use more than one `-I' option, the
     directories are scanned in left-to-right order; the standard
     system directories come after.

`-I-'
     Any directories you specify with `-I' options before the `-I-'
     option are searched only for the case of `#include "FILE"'; they
     are not searched for `#include <FILE>'.

     If additional directories are specified with `-I' options after
     the `-I-', these directories are searched for all `#include'
     directives.  (Ordinarily *all* `-I' directories are used this way.)

     In addition, the `-I-' option inhibits the use of the current
     directory (where the current input file came from) as the first
     search directory for `#include "FILE"'.  There is no way to
     override this effect of `-I-'.  With `-I.' you can specify
     searching the directory which was current when the compiler was
     invoked.  That is not exactly the same as what the preprocessor
     does by default, but it is often satisfactory.

     `-I-' does not inhibit the use of the standard system directories
     for header files.  Thus, `-I-' and `-nostdinc' are independent.

`-LDIR'
     Add directory DIR to the list of directories to be searched for
     `-l'.

`-BPREFIX'
     This option specifies where to find the executables, libraries,
     include files, and data files of the compiler itself.

     The compiler driver program runs one or more of the subprograms
     `cpp', `cc1', `as' and `ld'.  It tries PREFIX as a prefix for each
     program it tries to run, both with and without `MACHINE/VERSION/'
     (*note Target Options::.).

     For each subprogram to be run, the compiler driver first tries the
     `-B' prefix, if any.  If that name is not found, or if `-B' was
     not specified, the driver tries two standard prefixes, which are
     `/usr/lib/gcc/' and `/usr/local/lib/gcc-lib/'.  If neither of
     those results in a file name that is found, the unmodified program
     name is searched for using the directories specified in your
     `PATH' environment variable.

     `-B' prefixes that effectively specify directory names also apply
     to libraries in the linker, because the compiler translates these
     options into `-L' options for the linker.  They also apply to
     includes files in the preprocessor, because the compiler
     translates these options into `-isystem' options for the
     preprocessor.  In this case, the compiler appends `include' to the
     prefix.

     The run-time support file `libgcc.a' can also be searched for using
     the `-B' prefix, if needed.  If it is not found there, the two
     standard prefixes above are tried, and that is all.  The file is
     left out of the link if it is not found by those means.

     Another way to specify a prefix much like the `-B' prefix is to use
     the environment variable `GCC_EXEC_PREFIX'.  *Note Environment
     Variables::.

`-specs=FILE'
     Process FILE after the compiler reads in the standard `specs'
     file, in order to override the defaults that the `gcc' driver
     program uses when determining what switches to pass to `cc1',
     `cc1plus', `as', `ld', etc.  More than one `-specs='FILE can be
     specified on the command line, and they are processed in order,
     from left to right.

Specifying Target Machine and Compiler Version
==============================================

   By default, GNU CC compiles code for the same type of machine that
you are using.  However, it can also be installed as a cross-compiler,
to compile for some other type of machine.  In fact, several different
configurations of GNU CC, for different target machines, can be
installed side by side.  Then you specify which one to use with the
`-b' option.

   In addition, older and newer versions of GNU CC can be installed side
by side.  One of them (probably the newest) will be the default, but
you may sometimes wish to use another.

`-b MACHINE'
     The argument MACHINE specifies the target machine for compilation.
     This is useful when you have installed GNU CC as a cross-compiler.

     The value to use for MACHINE is the same as was specified as the
     machine type when configuring GNU CC as a cross-compiler.  For
     example, if a cross-compiler was configured with `configure
     i386v', meaning to compile for an 80386 running System V, then you
     would specify `-b i386v' to run that cross compiler.

     When you do not specify `-b', it normally means to compile for the
     same type of machine that you are using.

`-V VERSION'
     The argument VERSION specifies which version of GNU CC to run.
     This is useful when multiple versions are installed.  For example,
     VERSION might be `2.0', meaning to run GNU CC version 2.0.

     The default version, when you do not specify `-V', is the last
     version of GNU CC that you installed.

   The `-b' and `-V' options actually work by controlling part of the
file name used for the executable files and libraries used for
compilation.  A given version of GNU CC, for a given target machine, is
normally kept in the directory `/usr/local/lib/gcc-lib/MACHINE/VERSION'.

   Thus, sites can customize the effect of `-b' or `-V' either by
changing the names of these directories or adding alternate names (or
symbolic links).  If in directory `/usr/local/lib/gcc-lib/' the file
`80386' is a link to the file `i386v', then `-b 80386' becomes an alias
for `-b i386v'.

   In one respect, the `-b' or `-V' do not completely change to a
different compiler: the top-level driver program `gcc' that you
originally invoked continues to run and invoke the other executables
(preprocessor, compiler per se, assembler and linker) that do the real
work.  However, since no real work is done in the driver program, it
usually does not matter that the driver program in use is not the one
for the specified target and version.

   The only way that the driver program depends on the target machine is
in the parsing and handling of special machine-specific options.
However, this is controlled by a file which is found, along with the
other executables, in the directory for the specified version and
target machine.  As a result, a single installed driver program adapts
to any specified target machine and compiler version.

   The driver program executable does control one significant thing,
however: the default version and target machine.  Therefore, you can
install different instances of the driver program, compiled for
different targets or versions, under different names.

   For example, if the driver for version 2.0 is installed as `ogcc'
and that for version 2.1 is installed as `gcc', then the command `gcc'
will use version 2.1 by default, while `ogcc' will use 2.0 by default.
However, you can choose either version with either command with the
`-V' option.

Hardware Models and Configurations
==================================

   Earlier we discussed the standard option `-b' which chooses among
different installed compilers for completely different target machines,
such as Vax vs. 68000 vs. 80386.

   In addition, each of these target machine types can have its own
special options, starting with `-m', to choose among various hardware
models or configurations--for example, 68010 vs 68020, floating
coprocessor or none.  A single installed version of the compiler can
compile for any model or configuration, according to the options
specified.

   Some configurations of the compiler also support additional special
options, usually for compatibility with other compilers on the same
platform.

   These options are defined by the macro `TARGET_SWITCHES' in the
machine description.  The default for the options is also defined by
that macro, which enables you to change the defaults.

M680x0 Options
--------------

   These are the `-m' options defined for the 68000 series.  The default
values for these options depends on which style of 68000 was selected
when the compiler was configured; the defaults for the most common
choices are given below.

`-m68000'
`-mc68000'
     Generate output for a 68000.  This is the default when the
     compiler is configured for 68000-based systems.

`-m68020'
`-mc68020'
     Generate output for a 68020.  This is the default when the
     compiler is configured for 68020-based systems.

`-m68881'
     Generate output containing 68881 instructions for floating point.
     This is the default for most 68020 systems unless `-nfp' was
     specified when the compiler was configured.

`-m68030'
     Generate output for a 68030.  This is the default when the
     compiler is configured for 68030-based systems.

`-m68040'
     Generate output for a 68040.  This is the default when the
     compiler is configured for 68040-based systems.

     This option inhibits the use of 68881/68882 instructions that have
     to be emulated by software on the 68040.  If your 68040 does not
     have code to emulate those instructions, use `-m68040'.

`-m68060'
     Generate output for a 68060.  This is the default when the
     compiler is configured for 68060-based systems.

     This option inhibits the use of 68020 and 68881/68882 instructions
     that have to be emulated by software on the 68060.  If your 68060
     does not have code to emulate those instructions, use `-m68060'.

`-m5200'
     Generate output for a 520X "coldfire" family cpu.  This is the
     default when the compiler is configured for 520X-based systems.

`-m68020-40'
     Generate output for a 68040, without using any of the new
     instructions.  This results in code which can run relatively
     efficiently on either a 68020/68881 or a 68030 or a 68040.  The
     generated code does use the 68881 instructions that are emulated
     on the 68040.

`-m68020-60'
     Generate output for a 68060, without using any of the new
     instructions.  This results in code which can run relatively
     efficiently on either a 68020/68881 or a 68030 or a 68040.  The
     generated code does use the 68881 instructions that are emulated
     on the 68060.

`-mfpa'
     Generate output containing Sun FPA instructions for floating point.

`-msoft-float'
     Generate output containing library calls for floating point.
     *Warning:* the requisite libraries are not available for all m68k
     targets.  Normally the facilities of the machine's usual C
     compiler are used, but this can't be done directly in
     cross-compilation.  You must make your own arrangements to provide
     suitable library functions for cross-compilation.  The embedded
     targets `m68k-*-aout' and `m68k-*-coff' do provide software
     floating point support.

`-mshort'
     Consider type `int' to be 16 bits wide, like `short int'.

`-mnobitfield'
     Do not use the bit-field instructions.  The `-m68000' option
     implies `-mnobitfield'.

`-mbitfield'
     Do use the bit-field instructions.  The `-m68020' option implies
     `-mbitfield'.  This is the default if you use a configuration
     designed for a 68020.

`-mrtd'
     Use a different function-calling convention, in which functions
     that take a fixed number of arguments return with the `rtd'
     instruction, which pops their arguments while returning.  This
     saves one instruction in the caller since there is no need to pop
     the arguments there.

     This calling convention is incompatible with the one normally used
     on Unix, so you cannot use it if you need to call libraries
     compiled with the Unix compiler.

     Also, you must provide function prototypes for all functions that
     take variable numbers of arguments (including `printf'); otherwise
     incorrect code will be generated for calls to those functions.

     In addition, seriously incorrect code will result if you call a
     function with too many arguments.  (Normally, extra arguments are
     harmlessly ignored.)

     The `rtd' instruction is supported by the 68010, 68020, 68030,
     68040, and 68060 processors, but not by the 68000 or 5200.

`-malign-int'
`-mno-align-int'
     Control whether GNU CC aligns `int', `long', `long long', `float',
     `double', and `long double' variables on a 32-bit boundary
     (`-malign-int') or a 16-bit boundary (`-mno-align-int').  Aligning
     variables on 32-bit boundaries produces code that runs somewhat
     faster on processors with 32-bit busses at the expense of more
     memory.

     *Warning:* if you use the `-malign-int' switch, GNU CC will align
     structures containing the above types  differently than most
     published application binary interface specifications for the m68k.


File: gcc.info,  Node: VAX Options,  Next: SPARC Options,  Prev: M680x0 Options,  Up: Submodel Options

VAX Options
-----------

   These `-m' options are defined for the Vax:

`-munix'
     Do not output certain jump instructions (`aobleq' and so on) that
     the Unix assembler for the Vax cannot handle across long ranges.

`-mgnu'
     Do output those jump instructions, on the assumption that you will
     assemble with the GNU assembler.

`-mg'
     Output code for g-format floating point numbers instead of
     d-format.


File: gcc.info,  Node: SPARC Options,  Next: Convex Options,  Prev: VAX Options,  Up: Submodel Options

SPARC Options
-------------

   These `-m' switches are supported on the SPARC:

`-mno-app-regs'
`-mapp-regs'
     Specify `-mapp-regs' to generate output using the global registers
     2 through 4, which the SPARC SVR4 ABI reserves for applications.
     This is the default.

     To be fully SVR4 ABI compliant at the cost of some performance
     loss, specify `-mno-app-regs'.  You should compile libraries and
     system software with this option.

`-mfpu'
`-mhard-float'
     Generate output containing floating point instructions.  This is
     the default.

`-mno-fpu'
`-msoft-float'
     Generate output containing library calls for floating point.
     *Warning:* the requisite libraries are not available for all SPARC
     targets.  Normally the facilities of the machine's usual C
     compiler are used, but this cannot be done directly in
     cross-compilation.  You must make your own arrangements to provide
     suitable library functions for cross-compilation.  The embedded
     targets `sparc-*-aout' and `sparclite-*-*' do provide software
     floating point support.

     `-msoft-float' changes the calling convention in the output file;
     therefore, it is only useful if you compile *all* of a program with
     this option.  In particular, you need to compile `libgcc.a', the
     library that comes with GNU CC, with `-msoft-float' in order for
     this to work.

`-mhard-quad-float'
     Generate output containing quad-word (long double) floating point
     instructions.

`-msoft-quad-float'
     Generate output containing library calls for quad-word (long
     double) floating point instructions.  The functions called are
     those specified in the SPARC ABI.  This is the default.

     As of this writing, there are no sparc implementations that have
     hardware support for the quad-word floating point instructions.
     They all invoke a trap handler for one of these instructions, and
     then the trap handler emulates the effect of the instruction.
     Because of the trap handler overhead, this is much slower than
     calling the ABI library routines.  Thus the `-msoft-quad-float'
     option is the default.

`-mno-epilogue'
`-mepilogue'
     With `-mepilogue' (the default), the compiler always emits code for
     function exit at the end of each function.  Any function exit in
     the middle of the function (such as a return statement in C) will
     generate a jump to the exit code at the end of the function.

     With `-mno-epilogue', the compiler tries to emit exit code inline
     at every function exit.

`-mno-flat'
`-mflat'
     With `-mflat', the compiler does not generate save/restore
     instructions and will use a "flat" or single register window
     calling convention.  This model uses %i7 as the frame pointer and
     is compatible with the normal register window model.  Code from
     either may be intermixed.  The local registers and the input
     registers (0-5) are still treated as "call saved" registers and
     will be saved on the stack as necessary.

     With `-mno-flat' (the default), the compiler emits save/restore
     instructions (except for leaf functions) and is the normal mode of
     operation.

`-mno-unaligned-doubles'
`-munaligned-doubles'
     Assume that doubles have 8 byte alignment.  This is the default.

     With `-munaligned-doubles', GNU CC assumes that doubles have 8 byte
     alignment only if they are contained in another type, or if they
     have an absolute address.  Otherwise, it assumes they have 4 byte
     alignment.  Specifying this option avoids some rare compatibility
     problems with code generated by other compilers.  It is not the
     default because it results in a performance loss, especially for
     floating point code.

`-mv8'
`-msparclite'
     These two options select variations on the SPARC architecture.

     By default (unless specifically configured for the Fujitsu
     SPARClite), GCC generates code for the v7 variant of the SPARC
     architecture.

     `-mv8' will give you SPARC v8 code.  The only difference from v7
     code is that the compiler emits the integer multiply and integer
     divide instructions which exist in SPARC v8 but not in SPARC v7.

     `-msparclite' will give you SPARClite code.  This adds the integer
     multiply, integer divide step and scan (`ffs') instructions which
     exist in SPARClite but not in SPARC v7.

     These options are deprecated and will be deleted in GNU CC 2.9.
     They have been replaced with `-mcpu=xxx'.

`-mcypress'
`-msupersparc'
     These two options select the processor for which the code is
     optimised.

     With `-mcypress' (the default), the compiler optimizes code for the
     Cypress CY7C602 chip, as used in the SparcStation/SparcServer 3xx
     series.  This is also appropriate for the older SparcStation 1, 2,
     IPX etc.

     With `-msupersparc' the compiler optimizes code for the SuperSparc
     cpu, as used in the SparcStation 10, 1000 and 2000 series. This
     flag also enables use of the full SPARC v8 instruction set.

     These options are deprecated and will be deleted in GNU CC 2.9.
     They have been replaced with `-mcpu=xxx'.

`-mcpu=CPU_TYPE'
     Set the instruction set, register set, and instruction scheduling
     parameters for machine type CPU_TYPE.  Supported values for
     CPU_TYPE are `v7', `cypress', `v8', `supersparc', `sparclite',
     `f930', `f934', `sparclet', `tsc701', `v9', and `ultrasparc'.

     Default instruction scheduling parameters are used for values that
     select an architecture and not an implementation.  These are `v7',
     `v8', `sparclite', `sparclet', `v9'.

     Here is a list of each supported architecture and their supported
     implementations.

              v7:             cypress
              v8:             supersparc
              sparclite:      f930, f934
              sparclet:       tsc701
              v9:             ultrasparc

`-mtune=CPU_TYPE'
     Set the instruction scheduling parameters for machine type
     CPU_TYPE, but do not set the instruction set or register set that
     the option `-mcpu='CPU_TYPE would.

     The same values for `-mcpu='CPU_TYPE are used for
     `-mtune='CPU_TYPE, though the only useful values are those that
     select a particular cpu implementation: `cypress', `supersparc',
     `f930', `f934', `tsc701', `ultrasparc'.

`-malign-loops=NUM'
     Align loops to a 2 raised to a NUM byte boundary.  If
     `-malign-loops' is not specified, the default is 2.

`-malign-jumps=NUM'
     Align instructions that are only jumped to to a 2 raised to a NUM
     byte boundary.  If `-malign-jumps' is not specified, the default
     is 2.

`-malign-functions=NUM'
     Align the start of functions to a 2 raised to NUM byte boundary.
     If `-malign-functions' is not specified, the default is 2 if
     compiling for 32 bit sparc, and 5 if compiling for 64 bit sparc.

   These `-m' switches are supported in addition to the above on the
SPARCLET processor.

`-mlittle-endian'
     Generate code for a processor running in little-endian mode.

`-mlive-g0'
     Treat register `%g0' as a normal register.  GCC will continue to
     clobber it as necessary but will not assume it always reads as 0.

`-mbroken-saverestore'
     Generate code that does not use non-trivial forms of the `save' and
     `restore' instructions.  Early versions of the SPARCLET processor
     do not correctly handle `save' and `restore' instructions used with
     arguments.  They correctly handle them used without arguments.  A
     `save' instruction used without arguments increments the current
     window pointer but does not allocate a new stack frame.  It is
     assumed that the window overflow trap handler will properly handle
     this case as will interrupt handlers.

   These `-m' switches are supported in addition to the above on SPARC
V9 processors in 64 bit environments.

`-mlittle-endian'
     Generate code for a processor running in little-endian mode.

`-m32'
`-m64'
     Generate code for a 32 bit or 64 bit environment.  The 32 bit
     environment sets int, long and pointer to 32 bits.  The 64 bit
     environment sets int to 32 bits and long and pointer to 64 bits.

`-mcmodel=medlow'
     Generate code for the Medium/Low code model: the program must be
     linked in the low 32 bits of the address space.  Pointers are 64
     bits.  Programs can be statically or dynamically linked.

`-mcmodel=medmid'
     Generate code for the Medium/Middle code model: the program must
     be linked in the low 44 bits of the address space, the text
     segment must be less than 2G bytes, and data segment must be
     within 2G of the text segment.  Pointers are 64 bits.

`-mcmodel=medany'
     Generate code for the Medium/Anywhere code model: the program may
     be linked anywhere in the address space, the text segment must be
     less than 2G bytes, and data segment must be within 2G of the text
     segment.  Pointers are 64 bits.

`-mcmodel=embmedany'
     Generate code for the Medium/Anywhere code model for embedded
     systems: assume a 32 bit text and a 32 bit data segment, both
     starting anywhere (determined at link time).  Register %g4 points
     to the base of the data segment.  Pointers still 64 bits.
     Programs are statically linked, PIC is not supported.

`-mstack-bias'
`-mno-stack-bias'
     With `-mstack-bias', GNU CC assumes that the stack pointer, and
     frame pointer if present, are offset by -2047 which must be added
     back when making stack frame references.  Otherwise, assume no
     such offset is present.

Convex Options
--------------

   These `-m' options are defined for Convex:

`-mc1'
     Generate output for C1.  The code will run on any Convex machine.
     The preprocessor symbol `__convex__c1__' is defined.

`-mc2'
     Generate output for C2.  Uses instructions not available on C1.
     Scheduling and other optimizations are chosen for max performance
     on C2.  The preprocessor symbol `__convex_c2__' is defined.

`-mc32'
     Generate output for C32xx.  Uses instructions not available on C1.
     Scheduling and other optimizations are chosen for max performance
     on C32.  The preprocessor symbol `__convex_c32__' is defined.

`-mc34'
     Generate output for C34xx.  Uses instructions not available on C1.
     Scheduling and other optimizations are chosen for max performance
     on C34.  The preprocessor symbol `__convex_c34__' is defined.

`-mc38'
     Generate output for C38xx.  Uses instructions not available on C1.
     Scheduling and other optimizations are chosen for max performance
     on C38.  The preprocessor symbol `__convex_c38__' is defined.

`-margcount'
     Generate code which puts an argument count in the word preceding
     each argument list.  This is compatible with regular CC, and a few
     programs may need the argument count word.  GDB and other
     source-level debuggers do not need it; this info is in the symbol
     table.

`-mnoargcount'
     Omit the argument count word.  This is the default.

`-mvolatile-cache'
     Allow volatile references to be cached.  This is the default.

`-mvolatile-nocache'
     Volatile references bypass the data cache, going all the way to
     memory.  This is only needed for multi-processor code that does
     not use standard synchronization instructions.  Making
     non-volatile references to volatile locations will not necessarily
     work.

`-mlong32'
     Type long is 32 bits, the same as type int.  This is the default.

`-mlong64'
     Type long is 64 bits, the same as type long long.  This option is
     useless, because no library support exists for it.


File: gcc.info,  Node: AMD29K Options,  Next: ARM Options,  Prev: Convex Options,  Up: Submodel Options

AMD29K Options
--------------

   These `-m' options are defined for the AMD Am29000:

`-mdw'
     Generate code that assumes the `DW' bit is set, i.e., that byte and
     halfword operations are directly supported by the hardware.  This
     is the default.

`-mndw'
     Generate code that assumes the `DW' bit is not set.

`-mbw'
     Generate code that assumes the system supports byte and halfword
     write operations.  This is the default.

`-mnbw'
     Generate code that assumes the systems does not support byte and
     halfword write operations.  `-mnbw' implies `-mndw'.

`-msmall'
     Use a small memory model that assumes that all function addresses
     are either within a single 256 KB segment or at an absolute
     address of less than 256k.  This allows the `call' instruction to
     be used instead of a `const', `consth', `calli' sequence.

`-mnormal'
     Use the normal memory model: Generate `call' instructions only when
     calling functions in the same file and `calli' instructions
     otherwise.  This works if each file occupies less than 256 KB but
     allows the entire executable to be larger than 256 KB.  This is
     the default.

`-mlarge'
     Always use `calli' instructions.  Specify this option if you expect
     a single file to compile into more than 256 KB of code.

`-m29050'
     Generate code for the Am29050.

`-m29000'
     Generate code for the Am29000.  This is the default.

`-mkernel-registers'
     Generate references to registers `gr64-gr95' instead of to
     registers `gr96-gr127'.  This option can be used when compiling
     kernel code that wants a set of global registers disjoint from
     that used by user-mode code.

     Note that when this option is used, register names in `-f' flags
     must use the normal, user-mode, names.

`-muser-registers'
     Use the normal set of global registers, `gr96-gr127'.  This is the
     default.

`-mstack-check'
`-mno-stack-check'
     Insert (or do not insert) a call to `__msp_check' after each stack
     adjustment.  This is often used for kernel code.

`-mstorem-bug'
`-mno-storem-bug'
     `-mstorem-bug' handles 29k processors which cannot handle the
     separation of a mtsrim insn and a storem instruction (most 29000
     chips to date, but not the 29050).

`-mno-reuse-arg-regs'
`-mreuse-arg-regs'
     `-mno-reuse-arg-regs' tells the compiler to only use incoming
     argument registers for copying out arguments.  This helps detect
     calling a function with fewer arguments than it was declared with.

`-mno-impure-text'
`-mimpure-text'
     `-mimpure-text', used in addition to `-shared', tells the compiler
     to not pass `-assert pure-text' to the linker when linking a
     shared object.

`-msoft-float'
     Generate output containing library calls for floating point.
     *Warning:* the requisite libraries are not part of GNU CC.
     Normally the facilities of the machine's usual C compiler are
     used, but this can't be done directly in cross-compilation.  You
     must make your own arrangements to provide suitable library
     functions for cross-compilation.

ARM Options
-----------

   These `-m' options are defined for Advanced RISC Machines (ARM)
architectures:

`-mapcs-frame'
     Generate a stack frame that is compliant with the ARM Procedure
     Call Standard for all functions, even if this is not strictly
     necessary for correct execution of the code.

`-mapcs-26'
     Generate code for a processor running with a 26-bit program
     counter, and conforming to the function calling standards for the
     APCS 26-bit option.  This option replaces the `-m2' and `-m3'
     options of previous releases of the compiler.

`-mapcs-32'
     Generate code for a processor running with a 32-bit program
     counter, and conforming to the function calling standards for the
     APCS 32-bit option.  This option replaces the `-m6' option of
     previous releases of the compiler.

`-mhard-float'
     Generate output containing floating point instructions.  This is
     the default.

`-msoft-float'
     Generate output containing library calls for floating point.
     *Warning:* the requisite libraries are not available for all ARM
     targets.  Normally the facilities of the machine's usual C
     compiler are used, but this cannot be done directly in
     cross-compilation.  You must make your own arrangements to provide
     suitable library functions for cross-compilation.

     `-msoft-float' changes the calling convention in the output file;
     therefore, it is only useful if you compile *all* of a program with
     this option.  In particular, you need to compile `libgcc.a', the
     library that comes with GNU CC, with `-msoft-float' in order for
     this to work.

`-mlittle-endian'
     Generate code for a processor running in little-endian mode.  This
     is the default for all standard configurations.

`-mbig-endian'
     Generate code for a processor running in big-endian mode; the
     default is to compile code for a little-endian processor.

`-mwords-little-endian'
     This option only applies when generating code for big-endian
     processors.  Generate code for a little-endian word order but a
     big-endian byte order.  That is, a byte order of the form
     `32107654'.  Note: this option should only be used if you require
     compatibility with code for big-endian ARM processors generated by
     versions of the compiler prior to 2.8.

`-mshort-load-bytes'
     Do not try to load half-words (eg `short's) by loading a word from
     an unaligned address.  For some targets the MMU is configured to
     trap unaligned loads; use this option to generate code that is
     safe in these environments.

`-mno-short-load-bytes'
     Use unaligned word loads to load half-words (eg `short's).  This
     option produces more efficient code, but the MMU is sometimes
     configured to trap these instructions.

`-mbsd'
     This option only applies to RISC iX.  Emulate the native BSD-mode
     compiler.  This is the default if `-ansi' is not specified.

`-mxopen'
     This option only applies to RISC iX.  Emulate the native
     X/Open-mode compiler.

`-mno-symrename'
     This option only applies to RISC iX.  Do not run the assembler
     post-processor, `symrename', after code has been assembled.
     Normally it is necessary to modify some of the standard symbols in
     preparation for linking with the RISC iX C library; this option
     suppresses this pass.  The post-processor is never run when the
     compiler is built for cross-compilation.

MN10300 Options
---------------

   These `-m' options are defined for Matsushita MN10300 architectures:

`-mmult-bug'
     Generate code to avoid bugs in the multiply instructions for the
     MN10300 processors.  This is the default.

`-mno-mult-bug'
     Do not generate code to avoid bugs in the multiply instructions
     for the MN10300 processors.


File: gcc.info,  Node: M32R/D Options,  Next: M88K Options,  Prev: MN10300 Options,  Up: Submodel Options

M32R/D Options
--------------

   These `-m' options are defined for Mitsubishi M32R/D architectures:

`-mcode-model=small'
     Assume all objects live in the lower 16MB of memory (so that their
     addresses can be loaded with the `ld24' instruction), and assume
     all subroutines are reachable with the `bl' instruction.  This is
     the default.

     The addressability of a particular object can be set with the
     `model' attribute.

`-mcode-model=medium'
     Assume objects may be anywhere in the 32 bit address space (the
     compiler will generate `seth/add3' instructions to load their
     addresses), and assume all subroutines are reachable with the `bl'
     instruction.

`-mcode-model=large'
     Assume objects may be anywhere in the 32 bit address space (the
     compiler will generate `seth/add3' instructions to load their
     addresses), and assume subroutines may not be reachable with the
     `bl' instruction (the compiler will generate the much slower
     `seth/add3/jl' instruction sequence).

`-msdata=none'
     Disable use of the small data area.  Variables will be put into
     one of `.data', `bss', or `.rodata' (unless the `section'
     attribute has been specified).  This is the default.

     The small data area consists of sections `.sdata' and `.sbss'.
     Objects may be explicitly put in the small data area with the
     `section' attribute using one of these sections.

`-msdata=sdata'
     Put small global and static data in the small data area, but do not
     generate special code to reference them.

`-msdata=use'
     Put small global and static data in the small data area, and
     generate special instructions to reference them.

`-G NUM'
     Put global and static objects less than or equal to NUM bytes into
     the small data or bss sections instead of the normal data or bss
     sections.  The default value of NUM is 8.  The `-msdata' option
     must be set to one of `sdata' or `use' for this option to have any
     effect.

     All modules should be compiled with the same `-G NUM' value.
     Compiling with different values of NUM may or may not work; if it
     doesn't the linker will give an error message - incorrect code
     will not be generated.
