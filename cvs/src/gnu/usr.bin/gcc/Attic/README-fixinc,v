@So long, and thanks for all the bugs.

@This README file is copied into the directory for GCC-only header files
when fixincludes is run by the makefile for GCC.

Many of the files in this directory were made from the standard system
header files of this system by the shell script `fixincludes'.
They are system-specific, and will not work on any other kind of system.
They are also not part of GCC.  The reason for making the files here
is to fix the places in the header files which use constructs
that are incompatible with ANSI C.
