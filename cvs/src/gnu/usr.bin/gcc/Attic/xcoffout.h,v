   ??? The IBM rs6000/AIX assembler has a bug that causes bss block debug
   info to be occasionally lost.  A simple example is this:
	int a; static int b;
   The commands `gcc -g -c tmp.c; dump -t tmp.o' gives
[10]	m   0x00000016         1     0    0x8f  0x0000            .bs
[11]	m   0x00000000         1     0    0x90  0x0000            .es
...
[21]	m   0x00000000        -2     0    0x85  0x0000            b:S-1
   which is wrong.  The `b:S-1' must be between the `.bs' and `.es'.
   We can apparently work around the problem by forcing the text section
   (even if we are already in the text section) immediately before outputting
   the `.bs'.  This should be fixed in the next major AIX release (3.3?).  */
