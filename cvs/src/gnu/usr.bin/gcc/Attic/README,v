@So long, and thanks for all the bugs.

@This directory contains the version 2.8.1 release of the GNU C
compiler.  It includes all of the support for compiling C++ and
Objective C, including a run-time library for Objective C.

The GNU C compiler is free software.  See the file COPYING for copying
permission.

See the file gcc.texi (together with other files that it includes) for
installation and porting information.  The file INSTALL contains a
copy of the installation information, as plain ASCII.

Installing this package will create various files in subdirectories of
/usr/local/lib, which are passes used by the compiler and a library
named libgcc.a.  It will also create /usr/local/bin/gcc, which is
the user-level command to do a compilation.

See the Bugs chapter of the GCC Manual for how to report bugs
usefully.  An online readable version of the manual is in the files
gcc.info*.

The files pself.c and pself1.c are not part of GCC.
They are programs that print themselves on standard output.
They were written by Dario Dariol and Giovanni Cozzi, and are
included for your hacking pleasure.  Likewise pself2.c
(Who is the author of that?) and pself3.c (by Vlad Taeerov and Rashit
Fakhreyev).
