@First cut at making a minimal intrusive munge of gcc to fit in a BSD
framework.  This means, provide a Makefile.bsd-wrapper.  Remove
intermediate files from the source dir.  Build them in the obj-dir.
Add some Makefile hooks so we can tune the std Makefile for our
purpose but still have it behave normal for out-of-tree
configurations.  Only i386 is supported for now.  The other archs will
follow soon.   This checkin requires an existing makeinfo and a yacc
that accepts -o.

Cross Compilation and Floating Point
====================================

   While all modern machines use 2's complement representation for
integers, there are a variety of representations for floating point
numbers.  This means that in a cross-compiler the representation of
floating point numbers in the compiled program may be different from
that used in the machine doing the compilation.

   Because different representation systems may offer different amounts
of range and precision, the cross compiler cannot safely use the host
machine's floating point arithmetic.  Therefore, floating point
constants must be represented in the target machine's format.  This
means that the cross compiler cannot use `atof' to parse a floating
point constant; it must have its own special routine to use instead.
Also, constant folding must emulate the target machine's arithmetic (or
must not be done at all).

   The macros in the following table should be defined only if you are
cross compiling between different floating point formats.

   Otherwise, don't define them.  Then default definitions will be set
up which use `double' as the data type, `==' to test for equality, etc.

   You don't need to worry about how many times you use an operand of
any of these macros.  The compiler never uses operands which have side
effects.

`REAL_VALUE_TYPE'
     A macro for the C data type to be used to hold a floating point
     value in the target machine's format.  Typically this would be a
     `struct' containing an array of `int'.

`REAL_VALUES_EQUAL (X, Y)'
     A macro for a C expression which compares for equality the two
     values, X and Y, both of type `REAL_VALUE_TYPE'.

`REAL_VALUES_LESS (X, Y)'
     A macro for a C expression which tests whether X is less than Y,
     both values being of type `REAL_VALUE_TYPE' and interpreted as
     floating point numbers in the target machine's representation.

`REAL_VALUE_LDEXP (X, SCALE)'
     A macro for a C expression which performs the standard library
     function `ldexp', but using the target machine's floating point
     representation.  Both X and the value of the expression have type
     `REAL_VALUE_TYPE'.  The second argument, SCALE, is an integer.

`REAL_VALUE_FIX (X)'
     A macro whose definition is a C expression to convert the
     target-machine floating point value X to a signed integer.  X has
     type `REAL_VALUE_TYPE'.

`REAL_VALUE_UNSIGNED_FIX (X)'
     A macro whose definition is a C expression to convert the
     target-machine floating point value X to an unsigned integer.  X
     has type `REAL_VALUE_TYPE'.

`REAL_VALUE_RNDZINT (X)'
     A macro whose definition is a C expression to round the
     target-machine floating point value X towards zero to an integer
     value (but still as a floating point number).  X has type
     `REAL_VALUE_TYPE', and so does the value.

`REAL_VALUE_UNSIGNED_RNDZINT (X)'
     A macro whose definition is a C expression to round the
     target-machine floating point value X towards zero to an unsigned
     integer value (but still represented as a floating point number).
     X has type `REAL_VALUE_TYPE', and so does the value.

`REAL_VALUE_ATOF (STRING, MODE)'
     A macro for a C expression which converts STRING, an expression of
     type `char *', into a floating point number in the target machine's
     representation for mode MODE.  The value has type
     `REAL_VALUE_TYPE'.

`REAL_INFINITY'
     Define this macro if infinity is a possible floating point value,
     and therefore division by 0 is legitimate.

`REAL_VALUE_ISINF (X)'
     A macro for a C expression which determines whether X, a floating
     point value, is infinity.  The value has type `int'.  By default,
     this is defined to call `isinf'.

`REAL_VALUE_ISNAN (X)'
     A macro for a C expression which determines whether X, a floating
     point value, is a "nan" (not-a-number).  The value has type `int'.
     By default, this is defined to call `isnan'.

   Define the following additional macros if you want to make floating
point constant folding work while cross compiling.  If you don't define
them, cross compilation is still possible, but constant folding will
not happen for floating point values.

`REAL_ARITHMETIC (OUTPUT, CODE, X, Y)'
     A macro for a C statement which calculates an arithmetic operation
     of the two floating point values X and Y, both of type
     `REAL_VALUE_TYPE' in the target machine's representation, to
     produce a result of the same type and representation which is
     stored in OUTPUT (which will be a variable).

     The operation to be performed is specified by CODE, a tree code
     which will always be one of the following: `PLUS_EXPR',
     `MINUS_EXPR', `MULT_EXPR', `RDIV_EXPR', `MAX_EXPR', `MIN_EXPR'.

     The expansion of this macro is responsible for checking for
     overflow.  If overflow happens, the macro expansion should execute
     the statement `return 0;', which indicates the inability to
     perform the arithmetic operation requested.

`REAL_VALUE_NEGATE (X)'
     A macro for a C expression which returns the negative of the
     floating point value X.  Both X and the value of the expression
     have type `REAL_VALUE_TYPE' and are in the target machine's
     floating point representation.

     There is no way for this macro to report overflow, since overflow
     can't happen in the negation operation.

`REAL_VALUE_TRUNCATE (MODE, X)'
     A macro for a C expression which converts the floating point value
     X to mode MODE.

     Both X and the value of the expression are in the target machine's
     floating point representation and have type `REAL_VALUE_TYPE'.
     However, the value should have an appropriate bit pattern to be
     output properly as a floating constant whose precision accords
     with mode MODE.

     There is no way for this macro to report overflow.

`REAL_VALUE_TO_INT (LOW, HIGH, X)'
     A macro for a C expression which converts a floating point value X
     into a double-precision integer which is then stored into LOW and
     HIGH, two variables of type INT.

`REAL_VALUE_FROM_INT (X, LOW, HIGH)'
     A macro for a C expression which converts a double-precision
     integer found in LOW and HIGH, two variables of type INT, into a
     floating point value which is then stored into X.

Miscellaneous Parameters
========================

   Here are several miscellaneous parameters.

`PREDICATE_CODES'
     Define this if you have defined special-purpose predicates in the
     file `MACHINE.c'.  This macro is called within an initializer of an
     array of structures.  The first field in the structure is the name
     of a predicate and the second field is an array of rtl codes.  For
     each predicate, list all rtl codes that can be in expressions
     matched by the predicate.  The list should have a trailing comma.
     Here is an example of two entries in the list for a typical RISC
     machine:

          #define PREDICATE_CODES \
            {"gen_reg_rtx_operand", {SUBREG, REG}},  \
            {"reg_or_short_cint_operand", {SUBREG, REG, CONST_INT}},

     Defining this macro does not affect the generated code (however,
     incorrect definitions that omit an rtl code that may be matched by
     the predicate can cause the compiler to malfunction).  Instead, it
     allows the table built by `genrecog' to be more compact and
     efficient, thus speeding up the compiler.  The most important
     predicates to include in the list specified by this macro are
     thoses used in the most insn patterns.

`CASE_VECTOR_MODE'
     An alias for a machine mode name.  This is the machine mode that
     elements of a jump-table should have.

`CASE_VECTOR_PC_RELATIVE'
     Define this macro if jump-tables should contain relative addresses.

`CASE_DROPS_THROUGH'
     Define this if control falls through a `case' insn when the index
     value is out of range.  This means the specified default-label is
     actually ignored by the `case' insn proper.

`CASE_VALUES_THRESHOLD'
     Define this to be the smallest number of different values for
     which it is best to use a jump-table instead of a tree of
     conditional branches.  The default is four for machines with a
     `casesi' instruction and five otherwise.  This is best for most
     machines.

`WORD_REGISTER_OPERATIONS'
     Define this macro if operations between registers with integral
     mode smaller than a word are always performed on the entire
     register.  Most RISC machines have this property and most CISC
     machines do not.

`LOAD_EXTEND_OP (MODE)'
     Define this macro to be a C expression indicating when insns that
     read memory in MODE, an integral mode narrower than a word, set the
     bits outside of MODE to be either the sign-extension or the
     zero-extension of the data read.  Return `SIGN_EXTEND' for values
     of MODE for which the insn sign-extends, `ZERO_EXTEND' for which
     it zero-extends, and `NIL' for other modes.

     This macro is not called with MODE non-integral or with a width
     greater than or equal to `BITS_PER_WORD', so you may return any
     value in this case.  Do not define this macro if it would always
     return `NIL'.  On machines where this macro is defined, you will
     normally define it as the constant `SIGN_EXTEND' or `ZERO_EXTEND'.

`IMPLICIT_FIX_EXPR'
     An alias for a tree code that should be used by default for
     conversion of floating point values to fixed point.  Normally,
     `FIX_ROUND_EXPR' is used.

`FIXUNS_TRUNC_LIKE_FIX_TRUNC'
     Define this macro if the same instructions that convert a floating
     point number to a signed fixed point number also convert validly
     to an unsigned one.

`EASY_DIV_EXPR'
     An alias for a tree code that is the easiest kind of division to
     compile code for in the general case.  It may be `TRUNC_DIV_EXPR',
     `FLOOR_DIV_EXPR', `CEIL_DIV_EXPR' or `ROUND_DIV_EXPR'.  These four
     division operators differ in how they round the result to an
     integer.  `EASY_DIV_EXPR' is used when it is permissible to use
     any of those kinds of division and the choice should be made on
     the basis of efficiency.

`MOVE_MAX'
     The maximum number of bytes that a single instruction can move
     quickly from memory to memory.

`MAX_MOVE_MAX'
     The maximum number of bytes that a single instruction can move
     quickly from memory to memory.  If this is undefined, the default
     is `MOVE_MAX'.  Otherwise, it is the constant value that is the
     largest value that `MOVE_MAX' can have at run-time.

`SHIFT_COUNT_TRUNCATED'
     A C expression that is nonzero if on this machine the number of
     bits actually used for the count of a shift operation is equal to
     the number of bits needed to represent the size of the object
     being shifted.  When this macro is non-zero, the compiler will
     assume that it is safe to omit a sign-extend, zero-extend, and
     certain bitwise `and' instructions that truncates the count of a
     shift operation.  On machines that have instructions that act on
     bitfields at variable positions, which may include `bit test'
     instructions, a nonzero `SHIFT_COUNT_TRUNCATED' also enables
     deletion of truncations of the values that serve as arguments to
     bitfield instructions.

     If both types of instructions truncate the count (for shifts) and
     position (for bitfield operations), or if no variable-position
     bitfield instructions exist, you should define this macro.

     However, on some machines, such as the 80386 and the 680x0,
     truncation only applies to shift operations and not the (real or
     pretended) bitfield operations.  Define `SHIFT_COUNT_TRUNCATED' to
     be zero on such machines.  Instead, add patterns to the `md' file
     that include the implied truncation of the shift instructions.

     You need not define this macro if it would always have the value
     of zero.

`TRULY_NOOP_TRUNCATION (OUTPREC, INPREC)'
     A C expression which is nonzero if on this machine it is safe to
     "convert" an integer of INPREC bits to one of OUTPREC bits (where
     OUTPREC is smaller than INPREC) by merely operating on it as if it
     had only OUTPREC bits.

     On many machines, this expression can be 1.

     When `TRULY_NOOP_TRUNCATION' returns 1 for a pair of sizes for
     modes for which `MODES_TIEABLE_P' is 0, suboptimal code can result.
     If this is the case, making `TRULY_NOOP_TRUNCATION' return 0 in
     such cases may improve things.

`STORE_FLAG_VALUE'
     A C expression describing the value returned by a comparison
     operator with an integral mode and stored by a store-flag
     instruction (`sCOND') when the condition is true.  This
     description must apply to *all* the `sCOND' patterns and all the
     comparison operators whose results have a `MODE_INT' mode.

     A value of 1 or -1 means that the instruction implementing the
     comparison operator returns exactly 1 or -1 when the comparison is
     true and 0 when the comparison is false.  Otherwise, the value
     indicates which bits of the result are guaranteed to be 1 when the
     comparison is true.  This value is interpreted in the mode of the
     comparison operation, which is given by the mode of the first
     operand in the `sCOND' pattern.  Either the low bit or the sign
     bit of `STORE_FLAG_VALUE' be on.  Presently, only those bits are
     used by the compiler.

     If `STORE_FLAG_VALUE' is neither 1 or -1, the compiler will
     generate code that depends only on the specified bits.  It can also
     replace comparison operators with equivalent operations if they
     cause the required bits to be set, even if the remaining bits are
     undefined.  For example, on a machine whose comparison operators
     return an `SImode' value and where `STORE_FLAG_VALUE' is defined as
     `0x80000000', saying that just the sign bit is relevant, the
     expression

          (ne:SI (and:SI X (const_int POWER-OF-2)) (const_int 0))

     can be converted to

          (ashift:SI X (const_int N))

     where N is the appropriate shift count to move the bit being
     tested into the sign bit.

     There is no way to describe a machine that always sets the
     low-order bit for a true value, but does not guarantee the value
     of any other bits, but we do not know of any machine that has such
     an instruction.  If you are trying to port GNU CC to such a
     machine, include an instruction to perform a logical-and of the
     result with 1 in the pattern for the comparison operators and let
     us know (*note How to Report Bugs: Bug Reporting.).

     Often, a machine will have multiple instructions that obtain a
     value from a comparison (or the condition codes).  Here are rules
     to guide the choice of value for `STORE_FLAG_VALUE', and hence the
     instructions to be used:

        * Use the shortest sequence that yields a valid definition for
          `STORE_FLAG_VALUE'.  It is more efficient for the compiler to
          "normalize" the value (convert it to, e.g., 1 or 0) than for
          the comparison operators to do so because there may be
          opportunities to combine the normalization with other
          operations.

        * For equal-length sequences, use a value of 1 or -1, with -1
          being slightly preferred on machines with expensive jumps and
          1 preferred on other machines.

        * As a second choice, choose a value of `0x80000001' if
          instructions exist that set both the sign and low-order bits
          but do not define the others.

        * Otherwise, use a value of `0x80000000'.

     Many machines can produce both the value chosen for
     `STORE_FLAG_VALUE' and its negation in the same number of
     instructions.  On those machines, you should also define a pattern
     for those cases, e.g., one matching

          (set A (neg:M (ne:M B C)))

     Some machines can also perform `and' or `plus' operations on
     condition code values with less instructions than the corresponding
     `sCOND' insn followed by `and' or `plus'.  On those machines,
     define the appropriate patterns.  Use the names `incscc' and
     `decscc', respectively, for the the patterns which perform `plus'
     or `minus' operations on condition code values.  See `rs6000.md'
     for some examples.  The GNU Superoptizer can be used to find such
     instruction sequences on other machines.

     You need not define `STORE_FLAG_VALUE' if the machine has no
     store-flag instructions.

`FLOAT_STORE_FLAG_VALUE'
     A C expression that gives a non-zero floating point value that is
     returned when comparison operators with floating-point results are
     true.  Define this macro on machine that have comparison
     operations that return floating-point values.  If there are no
     such operations, do not define this macro.

`Pmode'
     An alias for the machine mode for pointers.  On most machines,
     define this to be the integer mode corresponding to the width of a
     hardware pointer; `SImode' on 32-bit machine or `DImode' on 64-bit
     machines.  On some machines you must define this to be one of the
     partial integer modes, such as `PSImode'.

     The width of `Pmode' must be at least as large as the value of
     `POINTER_SIZE'.  If it is not equal, you must define the macro
     `POINTERS_EXTEND_UNSIGNED' to specify how pointers are extended to
     `Pmode'.

`FUNCTION_MODE'
     An alias for the machine mode used for memory references to
     functions being called, in `call' RTL expressions.  On most
     machines this should be `QImode'.

`INTEGRATE_THRESHOLD (DECL)'
     A C expression for the maximum number of instructions above which
     the function DECL should not be inlined.  DECL is a
     `FUNCTION_DECL' node.

     The default definition of this macro is 64 plus 8 times the number
     of arguments that the function accepts.  Some people think a larger
     threshold should be used on RISC machines.

`SCCS_DIRECTIVE'
     Define this if the preprocessor should ignore `#sccs' directives
     and print no error message.

`NO_IMPLICIT_EXTERN_C'
     Define this macro if the system header files support C++ as well
     as C.  This macro inhibits the usual method of using system header
     files in C++, which is to pretend that the file's contents are
     enclosed in `extern "C" {...}'.

`HANDLE_PRAGMA (STREAM)'
     Define this macro if you want to implement any pragmas.  If
     defined, it should be a C statement to be executed when `#pragma'
     is seen.  The argument STREAM is the stdio input stream from which
     the source text can be read.

     It is generally a bad idea to implement new uses of `#pragma'.  The
     only reason to define this macro is for compatibility with other
     compilers that do support `#pragma' for the sake of any user
     programs which already use it.

`VALID_MACHINE_DECL_ATTRIBUTE (DECL, ATTRIBUTES, IDENTIFIER, ARGS)'
     If defined, a C expression whose value is nonzero if IDENTIFIER
     with arguments ARGS is a valid machine specific attribute for DECL.
     The attributes in ATTRIBUTES have previously been assigned to DECL.

`VALID_MACHINE_TYPE_ATTRIBUTE (TYPE, ATTRIBUTES, IDENTIFIER, ARGS)'
     If defined, a C expression whose value is nonzero if IDENTIFIER
     with arguments ARGS is a valid machine specific attribute for TYPE.
     The attributes in ATTRIBUTES have previously been assigned to TYPE.

`COMP_TYPE_ATTRIBUTES (TYPE1, TYPE2)'
     If defined, a C expression whose value is zero if the attributes on
     TYPE1 and TYPE2 are incompatible, one if they are compatible, and
     two if they are nearly compatible (which causes a warning to be
     generated).

`SET_DEFAULT_TYPE_ATTRIBUTES (TYPE)'
     If defined, a C statement that assigns default attributes to newly
     defined TYPE.

`DOLLARS_IN_IDENTIFIERS'
     Define this macro to control use of the character `$' in identifier
     names.  The value should be 0, 1, or 2.  0 means `$' is not allowed
     by default; 1 means it is allowed by default if `-traditional' is
     used; 2 means it is allowed by default provided `-ansi' is not
     used.  1 is the default; there is no need to define this macro in
     that case.

`NO_DOLLAR_IN_LABEL'
     Define this macro if the assembler does not accept the character
     `$' in label names.  By default constructors and destructors in
     G++ have `$' in the identifiers.  If this macro is defined, `.' is
     used instead.

`NO_DOT_IN_LABEL'
     Define this macro if the assembler does not accept the character
     `.' in label names.  By default constructors and destructors in G++
     have names that use `.'.  If this macro is defined, these names
     are rewritten to avoid `.'.

`DEFAULT_MAIN_RETURN'
     Define this macro if the target system expects every program's
     `main' function to return a standard "success" value by default
     (if no other value is explicitly returned).

     The definition should be a C statement (sans semicolon) to
     generate the appropriate rtl instructions.  It is used only when
     compiling the end of `main'.

`HAVE_ATEXIT'
     Define this if the target system supports the function `atexit'
     from the ANSI C standard.  If this is not defined, and
     `INIT_SECTION_ASM_OP' is not defined, a default `exit' function
     will be provided to support C++.

`EXIT_BODY'
     Define this if your `exit' function needs to do something besides
     calling an external function `_cleanup' before terminating with
     `_exit'.  The `EXIT_BODY' macro is only needed if netiher
     `HAVE_ATEXIT' nor `INIT_SECTION_ASM_OP' are defined.

`INSN_SETS_ARE_DELAYED (INSN)'
     Define this macro as a C expression that is nonzero if it is safe
     for the delay slot scheduler to place instructions in the delay
     slot of INSN, even if they appear to use a resource set or
     clobbered in INSN.  INSN is always a `jump_insn' or an `insn'; GNU
     CC knows that every `call_insn' has this behavior.  On machines
     where some `insn' or `jump_insn' is really a function call and
     hence has this behavior, you should define this macro.

     You need not define this macro if it would always return zero.

`INSN_REFERENCES_ARE_DELAYED (INSN)'
     Define this macro as a C expression that is nonzero if it is safe
     for the delay slot scheduler to place instructions in the delay
     slot of INSN, even if they appear to set or clobber a resource
     referenced in INSN.  INSN is always a `jump_insn' or an `insn'.
     On machines where some `insn' or `jump_insn' is really a function
     call and its operands are registers whose use is actually in the
     subroutine it calls, you should define this macro.  Doing so
     allows the delay slot scheduler to move instructions which copy
     arguments into the argument registers into the delay slot of INSN.

     You need not define this macro if it would always return zero.

`MACHINE_DEPENDENT_REORG (INSN)'
     In rare cases, correct code generation requires extra machine
     dependent processing between the second jump optimization pass and
     delayed branch scheduling.  On those machines, define this macro
     as a C statement to act on the code starting at INSN.

The Configuration File
**********************

   The configuration file `xm-MACHINE.h' contains macro definitions
that describe the machine and system on which the compiler is running,
unlike the definitions in `MACHINE.h', which describe the machine for
which the compiler is producing output.  Most of the values in
`xm-MACHINE.h' are actually the same on all machines that GNU CC runs
on, so large parts of all configuration files are identical.  But there
are some macros that vary:

`USG'
     Define this macro if the host system is System V.

`VMS'
     Define this macro if the host system is VMS.

`FATAL_EXIT_CODE'
     A C expression for the status code to be returned when the compiler
     exits after serious errors.

`SUCCESS_EXIT_CODE'
     A C expression for the status code to be returned when the compiler
     exits without serious errors.

`HOST_WORDS_BIG_ENDIAN'
     Defined if the host machine stores words of multi-word values in
     big-endian order.  (GNU CC does not depend on the host byte
     ordering within a word.)

`HOST_FLOAT_WORDS_BIG_ENDIAN'
     Define this macro to be 1 if the host machine stores `DFmode',
     `XFmode' or `TFmode' floating point numbers in memory with the
     word containing the sign bit at the lowest address; otherwise,
     define it to be zero.

     This macro need not be defined if the ordering is the same as for
     multi-word integers.

`HOST_FLOAT_FORMAT'
     A numeric code distinguishing the floating point format for the
     host machine.  See `TARGET_FLOAT_FORMAT' in *Note Storage Layout::
     for the alternatives and default.

`HOST_BITS_PER_CHAR'
     A C expression for the number of bits in `char' on the host
     machine.

`HOST_BITS_PER_SHORT'
     A C expression for the number of bits in `short' on the host
     machine.

`HOST_BITS_PER_INT'
     A C expression for the number of bits in `int' on the host machine.

`HOST_BITS_PER_LONG'
     A C expression for the number of bits in `long' on the host
     machine.

`ONLY_INT_FIELDS'
     Define this macro to indicate that the host compiler only supports
     `int' bit fields, rather than other integral types, including
     `enum', as do most C compilers.

`OBSTACK_CHUNK_SIZE'
     A C expression for the size of ordinary obstack chunks.  If you
     don't define this, a usually-reasonable default is used.

`OBSTACK_CHUNK_ALLOC'
     The function used to allocate obstack chunks.  If you don't define
     this, `xmalloc' is used.

`OBSTACK_CHUNK_FREE'
     The function used to free obstack chunks.  If you don't define
     this, `free' is used.

`USE_C_ALLOCA'
     Define this macro to indicate that the compiler is running with the
     `alloca' implemented in C.  This version of `alloca' can be found
     in the file `alloca.c'; to use it, you must also alter the
     `Makefile' variable `ALLOCA'.  (This is done automatically for the
     systems on which we know it is needed.)

     If you do define this macro, you should probably do it as follows:

          #ifndef __GNUC__
          #define USE_C_ALLOCA
          #else
          #define alloca __builtin_alloca
          #endif

     so that when the compiler is compiled with GNU CC it uses the more
     efficient built-in `alloca' function.

`FUNCTION_CONVERSION_BUG'
     Define this macro to indicate that the host compiler does not
     properly handle converting a function value to a
     pointer-to-function when it is used in an expression.

`HAVE_VPRINTF'
     Define this if the library function `vprintf' is available on your
     system.

`MULTIBYTE_CHARS'
     Define this macro to enable support for multibyte characters in the
     input to GNU CC.  This requires that the host system support the
     ANSI C library functions for converting multibyte characters to
     wide characters.

`HAVE_PUTENV'
     Define this if the library function `putenv' is available on your
     system.

`POSIX'
     Define this if your system is POSIX.1 compliant.

`NO_SYS_SIGLIST'
     Define this if your system *does not* provide the variable
     `sys_siglist'.

`DONT_DECLARE_SYS_SIGLIST'
     Define this if your system has the variable `sys_siglist', and
     there is already a declaration of it in the system header files.

`USE_PROTOTYPES'
     Define this to be 1 if you know that the host compiler supports
     prototypes, even if it doesn't define __STDC__, or define it to be
     0 if you do not want any prototypes used in compiling GNU CC.  If
     `USE_PROTOTYPES' is not defined, it will be determined
     automatically whether your compiler supports prototypes by
     checking if `__STDC__' is defined.

`NO_MD_PROTOTYPES'
     Define this if you wish suppression of prototypes generated from
     the machine description file, but to use other prototypes within
     GNU CC.  If `USE_PROTOTYPES' is defined to be 0, or the host
     compiler does not support prototypes, this macro has no effect.

`MD_CALL_PROTOTYPES'
     Define this if you wish to generate prototypes for the `gen_call'
     or `gen_call_value' functions generated from the machine
     description file.  If `USE_PROTOTYPES' is defined to be 0, or the
     host compiler does not support prototypes, or `NO_MD_PROTOTYPES'
     is defined, this macro has no effect.  As soon as all of the
     machine descriptions are modified to have the appropriate number
     of arguments, this macro will be removed.

     Some systems do provide this variable, but with a different name
     such as `_sys_siglist'.  On these systems, you can define
     `sys_siglist' as a macro which expands into the name actually
     provided.

`NO_STAB_H'
     Define this if your system does not have the include file
     `stab.h'.  If `USG' is defined, `NO_STAB_H' is assumed.

`PATH_SEPARATOR'
     Define this macro to be a C character constant representing the
     character used to separate components in paths.  The default value
     is.  the colon character

`DIR_SEPARATOR'
     If your system uses some character other than slash to separate
     directory names within a file specification, define this macro to
     be a C character constant specifying that character.  When GNU CC
     displays file names, the character you specify will be used.  GNU
     CC will test for both slash and the character you specify when
     parsing filenames.

`OBJECT_SUFFIX'
     Define this macro to be a C string representing the suffix for
     object files on your machine.  If you do not define this macro,
     GNU CC will use `.o' as the suffix for object files.

`EXECUTABLE_SUFFIX'
     Define this macro to be a C string representing the suffix for
     executable files on your machine.  If you do not define this
     macro, GNU CC will use the null string as the suffix for object
     files.

`COLLECT_EXPORT_LIST'
     If defined, `collect2' will scan the individual object files
     specified on its command line and create an export list for the
     linker.  Define this macro for systems like AIX, where the linker
     discards object files that are not referenced from `main' and uses
     export lists.

   In addition, configuration files for system V define `bcopy',
`bzero' and `bcmp' as aliases.  Some files define `alloca' as a macro
when compiled with GNU CC, in order to take advantage of the benefit of
GNU CC's built-in `alloca'.

Makefile Fragments
******************

   When you configure GNU CC using the `configure' script (*note
Installation::.), it will construct the file `Makefile' from the
template file `Makefile.in'.  When it does this, it will incorporate
makefile fragment files from the `config' directory, named `t-TARGET'
and `x-HOST'.  If these files do not exist, it means nothing needs to
be added for a given target or host.

* Menu:

* Target Fragment:: Writing the `t-TARGET' file.
* Host Fragment::   Writing the `x-HOST' file.


File: gcc.info,  Node: Target Fragment,  Next: Host Fragment,  Up: Fragments

The Target Makefile Fragment
============================

   The target makefile fragment, `t-TARGET', defines special target
dependent variables and targets used in the `Makefile':

`LIBGCC1'
     The rule to use to build `libgcc1.a'.  If your target does not
     need to use the functions in `libgcc1.a', set this to empty.
     *Note Interface::.

`CROSS_LIBGCC1'
     The rule to use to build `libgcc1.a' when building a cross
     compiler.  If your target does not need to use the functions in
     `libgcc1.a', set this to empty.  *Note Cross Runtime::.

`LIBGCC2_CFLAGS'
     Compiler flags to use when compiling `libgcc2.c'.

`LIB2FUNCS_EXTRA'
     A list of source file names to be compiled or assembled and
     inserted into `libgcc.a'.

`CRTSTUFF_T_CFLAGS'
     Special flags used when compiling `crtstuff.c'.  *Note
     Initialization::.

`MULTILIB_OPTIONS'
     For some targets, invoking GNU CC in different ways produces
     objects that can not be linked together.  For example, for some
     targets GNU CC produces both big and little endian code.  For
     these targets, you must arrange for multiple versions of
     `libgcc.a' to be compiled, one for each set of incompatible
     options.  When GNU CC invokes the linker, it arranges to link in
     the right version of `libgcc.a', based on the command line options
     used.

     The `MULTILIB_OPTIONS' macro lists the set of options for which
     special versions of `libgcc.a' must be built.  Write options that
     are mutually incompatible side by side, separated by a slash.
     Write options that may be used together separated by a space.  The
     build procedure will build all combinations of compatible options.

     For example, if you set `MULTILIB_OPTIONS' to `m68000/m68020
     msoft-float', `Makefile' will build special versions of `libgcc.a'
     using the options `-m68000', `-m68020', `-msoft-float', `-m68000
     -msoft-float', and `-m68020 -msoft-float'.

`MULTILIB_DIRNAMES'
     If `MULTILIB_OPTIONS' is used, this variable specifies the
     directory names that should be used to hold the various libraries.
     Write one element in `MULTILIB_DIRNAMES' for each element in
     `MULTILIB_OPTIONS'.  If `MULTILIB_DIRNAMES' is not used, the
     default value will be `MULTILIB_OPTIONS', with all slashes treated
     as spaces.

     For example, if `MULTILIB_OPTIONS' is `m68000/m68020 msoft-float',
     then the default value of `MULTILIB_DIRNAMES' is `m68000 m68020
     msoft-float'.  You may specify a different value if you desire a
     different set of directory names.

`MULTILIB_MATCHES'
     Sometimes the same option may be written in two different ways.
     If an option is listed in `MULTILIB_OPTIONS', GNU CC needs to know
     about any synonyms.  In that case, set `MULTILIB_MATCHES' to a
     list of items of the form `option=option' to describe all relevant
     synonyms.  For example, `m68000=mc68000 m68020=mc68020'.

Describing Relative Costs of Operations
=======================================
d38 138
a175 181
   These macros let you describe the relative speed of various
operations on the target machine.

`CONST_COSTS (X, CODE, OUTER_CODE)'
     A part of a C `switch' statement that describes the relative costs
     of constant RTL expressions.  It must contain `case' labels for
     expression codes `const_int', `const', `symbol_ref', `label_ref'
     and `const_double'.  Each case must ultimately reach a `return'
     statement to return the relative cost of the use of that kind of
     constant value in an expression.  The cost may depend on the
     precise value of the constant, which is available for examination
     in X, and the rtx code of the expression in which it is contained,
     found in OUTER_CODE.

     CODE is the expression code--redundant, since it can be obtained
     with `GET_CODE (X)'.

`RTX_COSTS (X, CODE, OUTER_CODE)'
     Like `CONST_COSTS' but applies to nonconstant RTL expressions.
     This can be used, for example, to indicate how costly a multiply
     instruction is.  In writing this macro, you can use the construct
     `COSTS_N_INSNS (N)' to specify a cost equal to N fast
     instructions.  OUTER_CODE is the code of the expression in which X
     is contained.

     This macro is optional; do not define it if the default cost
     assumptions are adequate for the target machine.

`ADDRESS_COST (ADDRESS)'
     An expression giving the cost of an addressing mode that contains
     ADDRESS.  If not defined, the cost is computed from the ADDRESS
     expression and the `CONST_COSTS' values.

     For most CISC machines, the default cost is a good approximation
     of the true cost of the addressing mode.  However, on RISC
     machines, all instructions normally have the same length and
     execution time.  Hence all addresses will have equal costs.

     In cases where more than one form of an address is known, the form
     with the lowest cost will be used.  If multiple forms have the
     same, lowest, cost, the one that is the most complex will be used.

     For example, suppose an address that is equal to the sum of a
     register and a constant is used twice in the same basic block.
     When this macro is not defined, the address will be computed in a
     register and memory references will be indirect through that
     register.  On machines where the cost of the addressing mode
     containing the sum is no higher than that of a simple indirect
     reference, this will produce an additional instruction and
     possibly require an additional register.  Proper specification of
     this macro eliminates this overhead for such machines.

     Similar use of this macro is made in strength reduction of loops.

     ADDRESS need not be valid as an address.  In such a case, the cost
     is not relevant and can be any value; invalid addresses need not be
     assigned a different cost.

     On machines where an address involving more than one register is as
     cheap as an address computation involving only one register,
     defining `ADDRESS_COST' to reflect this can cause two registers to
     be live over a region of code where only one would have been if
     `ADDRESS_COST' were not defined in that manner.  This effect should
     be considered in the definition of this macro.  Equivalent costs
     should probably only be given to addresses with different numbers
     of registers on machines with lots of registers.

     This macro will normally either not be defined or be defined as a
     constant.

`REGISTER_MOVE_COST (FROM, TO)'
     A C expression for the cost of moving data from a register in class
     FROM to one in class TO.  The classes are expressed using the
     enumeration values such as `GENERAL_REGS'.  A value of 2 is the
     default; other values are interpreted relative to that.

     It is not required that the cost always equal 2 when FROM is the
     same as TO; on some machines it is expensive to move between
     registers if they are not general registers.

     If reload sees an insn consisting of a single `set' between two
     hard registers, and if `REGISTER_MOVE_COST' applied to their
     classes returns a value of 2, reload does not check to ensure that
     the constraints of the insn are met.  Setting a cost of other than
     2 will allow reload to verify that the constraints are met.  You
     should do this if the `movM' pattern's constraints do not allow
     such copying.

`MEMORY_MOVE_COST (M)'
     A C expression for the cost of moving data of mode M between a
     register and memory.  A value of 4 is the default; this cost is
     relative to those in `REGISTER_MOVE_COST'.

     If moving between registers and memory is more expensive than
     between two registers, you should define this macro to express the
     relative cost.

`BRANCH_COST'
     A C expression for the cost of a branch instruction.  A value of 1
     is the default; other values are interpreted relative to that.

   Here are additional macros which do not specify precise relative
costs, but only that certain actions are more expensive than GNU CC
would ordinarily expect.

`SLOW_BYTE_ACCESS'
     Define this macro as a C expression which is nonzero if accessing
     less than a word of memory (i.e. a `char' or a `short') is no
     faster than accessing a word of memory, i.e., if such access
     require more than one instruction or if there is no difference in
     cost between byte and (aligned) word loads.

     When this macro is not defined, the compiler will access a field by
     finding the smallest containing object; when it is defined, a
     fullword load will be used if alignment permits.  Unless bytes
     accesses are faster than word accesses, using word accesses is
     preferable since it may eliminate subsequent memory access if
     subsequent accesses occur to other fields in the same word of the
     structure, but to different bytes.

`SLOW_ZERO_EXTEND'
     Define this macro if zero-extension (of a `char' or `short' to an
     `int') can be done faster if the destination is a register that is
     known to be zero.

     If you define this macro, you must have instruction patterns that
     recognize RTL structures like this:

          (set (strict_low_part (subreg:QI (reg:SI ...) 0)) ...)

     and likewise for `HImode'.

`SLOW_UNALIGNED_ACCESS'
     Define this macro to be the value 1 if unaligned accesses have a
     cost many times greater than aligned accesses, for example if they
     are emulated in a trap handler.

     When this macro is non-zero, the compiler will act as if
     `STRICT_ALIGNMENT' were non-zero when generating code for block
     moves.  This can cause significantly more instructions to be
     produced.  Therefore, do not set this macro non-zero if unaligned
     accesses only add a cycle or two to the time for a memory access.

     If the value of this macro is always zero, it need not be defined.

`DONT_REDUCE_ADDR'
     Define this macro to inhibit strength reduction of memory
     addresses.  (On some machines, such strength reduction seems to do
     harm rather than good.)

`MOVE_RATIO'
     The number of scalar move insns which should be generated instead
     of a string move insn or a library call.  Increasing the value
     will always make code faster, but eventually incurs high cost in
     increased code size.

     If you don't define this, a reasonable default is used.

`NO_FUNCTION_CSE'
     Define this macro if it is as good or better to call a constant
     function address than to call an address kept in a register.

`NO_RECURSIVE_FUNCTION_CSE'
     Define this macro if it is as good or better for a function to call
     itself with an explicit address than to call an address kept in a
     register.

`ADJUST_COST (INSN, LINK, DEP_INSN, COST)'
     A C statement (sans semicolon) to update the integer variable COST
     based on the relationship between INSN that is dependent on
     DEP_INSN through the dependence LINK.  The default is to make no
     adjustment to COST.  This can be used for example to specify to
     the scheduler that an output- or anti-dependence does not incur
     the same cost as a data-dependence.

`ADJUST_PRIORITY (INSN)'
     A C statement (sans semicolon) to update the integer scheduling
     priority `INSN_PRIORITY(INSN)'.  Reduce the priority to execute
     the INSN earlier, increase the priority to execute INSN later.
     Do not define this macro if you do not need to adjust the
     scheduling priorities of insns.

Dividing the Output into Sections (Texts, Data, ...)
====================================================
d183 1
a183 34
   An object file is divided into sections containing different types of
data.  In the most common case, there are three sections: the "text
section", which holds instructions and read-only data; the "data
section", which holds initialized writable data; and the "bss section",
which holds uninitialized data.  Some systems have other kinds of
sections.

   The compiler must tell the assembler when to switch sections.  These
macros control what commands to output to tell the assembler this.  You
can also define additional sections.

`TEXT_SECTION_ASM_OP'
     A C expression whose value is a string containing the assembler
     operation that should precede instructions and read-only data.
     Normally `".text"' is right.

`DATA_SECTION_ASM_OP'
     A C expression whose value is a string containing the assembler
     operation to identify the following data as writable initialized
     data.  Normally `".data"' is right.

`SHARED_SECTION_ASM_OP'
     If defined, a C expression whose value is a string containing the
     assembler operation to identify the following data as shared data.
     If not defined, `DATA_SECTION_ASM_OP' will be used.

`BSS_SECTION_ASM_OP'
     If defined, a C expression whose value is a string containing the
     assembler operation to identify the following data as
     uninitialized global data.  If not defined, and neither
     `ASM_OUTPUT_BSS' nor `ASM_OUTPUT_ALIGNED_BSS' are defined,
     uninitialized global data will be output in the data section if
     `-fno-common' is passed, otherwise `ASM_OUTPUT_COMMON' will be
     used.
d185 357
a541 95
`SHARED_BSS_SECTION_ASM_OP'
     If defined, a C expression whose value is a string containing the
     assembler operation to identify the following data as
     uninitialized global shared data.  If not defined, and
     `BSS_SECTION_ASM_OP' is, the latter will be used.

`INIT_SECTION_ASM_OP'
     If defined, a C expression whose value is a string containing the
     assembler operation to identify the following data as
     initialization code.  If not defined, GNU CC will assume such a
     section does not exist.

`EXTRA_SECTIONS'
     A list of names for sections other than the standard two, which are
     `in_text' and `in_data'.  You need not define this macro on a
     system with no other sections (that GCC needs to use).

`EXTRA_SECTION_FUNCTIONS'
     One or more functions to be defined in `varasm.c'.  These
     functions should do jobs analogous to those of `text_section' and
     `data_section', for your additional sections.  Do not define this
     macro if you do not define `EXTRA_SECTIONS'.

`READONLY_DATA_SECTION'
     On most machines, read-only variables, constants, and jump tables
     are placed in the text section.  If this is not the case on your
     machine, this macro should be defined to be the name of a function
     (either `data_section' or a function defined in `EXTRA_SECTIONS')
     that switches to the section to be used for read-only items.

     If these items should be placed in the text section, this macro
     should not be defined.

`SELECT_SECTION (EXP, RELOC)'
     A C statement or statements to switch to the appropriate section
     for output of EXP.  You can assume that EXP is either a `VAR_DECL'
     node or a constant of some sort.  RELOC indicates whether the
     initial value of EXP requires link-time relocations.  Select the
     section by calling `text_section' or one of the alternatives for
     other sections.

     Do not define this macro if you put all read-only variables and
     constants in the read-only data section (usually the text section).

`SELECT_RTX_SECTION (MODE, RTX)'
     A C statement or statements to switch to the appropriate section
     for output of RTX in mode MODE.  You can assume that RTX is some
     kind of constant in RTL.  The argument MODE is redundant except in
     the case of a `const_int' rtx.  Select the section by calling
     `text_section' or one of the alternatives for other sections.

     Do not define this macro if you put all constants in the read-only
     data section.

`JUMP_TABLES_IN_TEXT_SECTION'
     Define this macro if jump tables (for `tablejump' insns) should be
     output in the text section, along with the assembler instructions.
     Otherwise, the readonly data section is used.

     This macro is irrelevant if there is no separate readonly data
     section.

`ENCODE_SECTION_INFO (DECL)'
     Define this macro if references to a symbol must be treated
     differently depending on something about the variable or function
     named by the symbol (such as what section it is in).

     The macro definition, if any, is executed immediately after the
     rtl for DECL has been created and stored in `DECL_RTL (DECL)'.
     The value of the rtl will be a `mem' whose address is a
     `symbol_ref'.

     The usual thing for this macro to do is to record a flag in the
     `symbol_ref' (such as `SYMBOL_REF_FLAG') or to store a modified
     name string in the `symbol_ref' (if one bit is not enough
     information).

`STRIP_NAME_ENCODING (VAR, SYM_NAME)'
     Decode SYM_NAME and store the real name part in VAR, sans the
     characters that encode section info.  Define this macro if
     `ENCODE_SECTION_INFO' alters the symbol's name string.

`UNIQUE_SECTION_P (DECL)'
     A C expression which evaluates to true if DECL should be placed
     into a unique section for some target-specific reason.  If you do
     not define this macro, the default is `0'.  Note that the flag
     `-ffunction-sections' will also cause functions to be placed into
     unique sections.

`UNIQUE_SECTION (DECL, RELOC)'
     A C statement to build up a unique section name, expressed as a
     STRING_CST node, and assign it to `DECL_SECTION_NAME (DECL)'.
     RELOC indicates whether the initial value of EXP requires
     link-time relocations.  If you do not define this macro, GNU CC
     will use the symbol name prefixed by `.' as the section name.

Position Independent Code
=========================
d549 188
a736 47
   This section describes macros that help implement generation of
position independent code.  Simply defining these macros is not enough
to generate valid PIC; you must also add support to the macros
`GO_IF_LEGITIMATE_ADDRESS' and `PRINT_OPERAND_ADDRESS', as well as
`LEGITIMIZE_ADDRESS'.  You must modify the definition of `movsi' to do
something appropriate when the source operand contains a symbolic
address.  You may also need to alter the handling of switch statements
so that they use relative addresses.

`PIC_OFFSET_TABLE_REGNUM'
     The register number of the register used to address a table of
     static data addresses in memory.  In some cases this register is
     defined by a processor's "application binary interface" (ABI).
     When this macro is defined, RTL is generated for this register
     once, as with the stack pointer and frame pointer registers.  If
     this macro is not defined, it is up to the machine-dependent files
     to allocate such a register (if necessary).

`PIC_OFFSET_TABLE_REG_CALL_CLOBBERED'
     Define this macro if the register defined by
     `PIC_OFFSET_TABLE_REGNUM' is clobbered by calls.  Do not define
     this macro if `PPIC_OFFSET_TABLE_REGNUM' is not defined.

`FINALIZE_PIC'
     By generating position-independent code, when two different
     programs (A and B) share a common library (libC.a), the text of
     the library can be shared whether or not the library is linked at
     the same address for both programs.  In some of these
     environments, position-independent code requires not only the use
     of different addressing modes, but also special code to enable the
     use of these addressing modes.

     The `FINALIZE_PIC' macro serves as a hook to emit these special
     codes once the function is being compiled into assembly code, but
     not before.  (It is not done before, because in the case of
     compiling an inline function, it would lead to multiple PIC
     prologues being included in functions which used inline functions
     and were compiled to assembly language.)

`LEGITIMATE_PIC_OPERAND_P (X)'
     A C expression that is nonzero if X is a legitimate immediate
     operand on the target machine when generating position independent
     code.  You can assume that X satisfies `CONSTANT_P', so you need
     not check this.  You can also assume FLAG_PIC is true, so you need
     not check it either.  You need not define this macro if all
     constants (including `SYMBOL_REF') can be immediate operands when
     generating position independent code.

The Overall Framework of an Assembler File
------------------------------------------

   This describes the overall framework of an assembler file.
d765 30
a794 104
`ASM_FILE_START (STREAM)'
     A C expression which outputs to the stdio stream STREAM some
     appropriate text to go at the start of an assembler file.

     Normally this macro is defined to output a line containing
     `#NO_APP', which is a comment that has no effect on most
     assemblers but tells the GNU assembler that it can save time by not
     checking for certain assembler constructs.

     On systems that use SDB, it is necessary to output certain
     commands; see `attasm.h'.

`ASM_FILE_END (STREAM)'
     A C expression which outputs to the stdio stream STREAM some
     appropriate text to go at the end of an assembler file.

     If this macro is not defined, the default is to output nothing
     special at the end of the file.  Most systems don't require any
     definition.

     On systems that use SDB, it is necessary to output certain
     commands; see `attasm.h'.

`ASM_IDENTIFY_GCC (FILE)'
     A C statement to output assembler commands which will identify the
     object file as having been compiled with GNU CC (or another GNU
     compiler).

     If you don't define this macro, the string `gcc_compiled.:' is
     output.  This string is calculated to define a symbol which, on
     BSD systems, will never be defined for any other reason.  GDB
     checks for the presence of this symbol when reading the symbol
     table of an executable.

     On non-BSD systems, you must arrange communication with GDB in
     some other fashion.  If GDB is not used on your system, you can
     define this macro with an empty body.

`ASM_COMMENT_START'
     A C string constant describing how to begin a comment in the target
     assembler language.  The compiler assumes that the comment will
     end at the end of the line.

`ASM_APP_ON'
     A C string constant for text to be output before each `asm'
     statement or group of consecutive ones.  Normally this is
     `"#APP"', which is a comment that has no effect on most assemblers
     but tells the GNU assembler that it must check the lines that
     follow for all valid assembler constructs.

`ASM_APP_OFF'
     A C string constant for text to be output after each `asm'
     statement or group of consecutive ones.  Normally this is
     `"#NO_APP"', which tells the GNU assembler to resume making the
     time-saving assumptions that are valid for ordinary compiler
     output.

`ASM_OUTPUT_SOURCE_FILENAME (STREAM, NAME)'
     A C statement to output COFF information or DWARF debugging
     information which indicates that filename NAME is the current
     source file to the stdio stream STREAM.

     This macro need not be defined if the standard form of output for
     the file format in use is appropriate.

`OUTPUT_QUOTED_STRING (STREAM, NAME)'
     A C statement to output the string STRING to the stdio stream
     STREAM.  If you do not call the function `output_quoted_string' in
     your config files, GNU CC will only call it to output filenames to
     the assembler source.  So you can use it to canonicalize the format
     of the filename using this macro.

`ASM_OUTPUT_SOURCE_LINE (STREAM, LINE)'
     A C statement to output DBX or SDB debugging information before
     code for line number LINE of the current source file to the stdio
     stream STREAM.

     This macro need not be defined if the standard form of debugging
     information for the debugger in use is appropriate.

`ASM_OUTPUT_IDENT (STREAM, STRING)'
     A C statement to output something to the assembler file to handle a
     `#ident' directive containing the text STRING.  If this macro is
     not defined, nothing is output for a `#ident' directive.

`ASM_OUTPUT_SECTION_NAME (STREAM, DECL, NAME, RELOC)'
     A C statement to output something to the assembler file to switch
     to section NAME for object DECL which is either a `FUNCTION_DECL',
     a `VAR_DECL' or `NULL_TREE'.  RELOC indicates whether the initial
     value of EXP requires link-time relocations.  Some target formats
     do not support arbitrary sections.  Do not define this macro in
     such cases.

     At present this macro is only used to support section attributes.
     When this macro is undefined, section attributes are disabled.

`OBJC_PROLOGUE'
     A C statement to output any assembler statements which are
     required to precede any Objective C object definitions or message
     sending.  The statement is executed only when compiling an
     Objective C program.

Output of Data
--------------

   This describes data output.

`ASM_OUTPUT_LONG_DOUBLE (STREAM, VALUE)'
`ASM_OUTPUT_DOUBLE (STREAM, VALUE)'
`ASM_OUTPUT_FLOAT (STREAM, VALUE)'
`ASM_OUTPUT_THREE_QUARTER_FLOAT (STREAM, VALUE)'
`ASM_OUTPUT_SHORT_FLOAT (STREAM, VALUE)'
`ASM_OUTPUT_BYTE_FLOAT (STREAM, VALUE)'
     A C statement to output to the stdio stream STREAM an assembler
     instruction to assemble a floating-point constant of `TFmode',
     `DFmode', `SFmode', `TQFmode', `HFmode', or `QFmode',
     respectively, whose value is VALUE.  VALUE will be a C expression
     of type `REAL_VALUE_TYPE'.  Macros such as
     `REAL_VALUE_TO_TARGET_DOUBLE' are useful for writing these
     definitions.

`ASM_OUTPUT_QUADRUPLE_INT (STREAM, EXP)'
`ASM_OUTPUT_DOUBLE_INT (STREAM, EXP)'
`ASM_OUTPUT_INT (STREAM, EXP)'
`ASM_OUTPUT_SHORT (STREAM, EXP)'
`ASM_OUTPUT_CHAR (STREAM, EXP)'
     A C statement to output to the stdio stream STREAM an assembler
     instruction to assemble an integer of 16, 8, 4, 2 or 1 bytes,
     respectively, whose value is VALUE.  The argument EXP will be an
     RTL expression which represents a constant value.  Use
     `output_addr_const (STREAM, EXP)' to output this value as an
     assembler expression.

     For sizes larger than `UNITS_PER_WORD', if the action of a macro
     would be identical to repeatedly calling the macro corresponding to
     a size of `UNITS_PER_WORD', once for each word, you need not define
     the macro.

`ASM_OUTPUT_BYTE (STREAM, VALUE)'
     A C statement to output to the stdio stream STREAM an assembler
     instruction to assemble a single byte containing the number VALUE.

`ASM_BYTE_OP'
     A C string constant giving the pseudo-op to use for a sequence of
     single-byte constants.  If this macro is not defined, the default
     is `"byte"'.

`ASM_OUTPUT_ASCII (STREAM, PTR, LEN)'
     A C statement to output to the stdio stream STREAM an assembler
     instruction to assemble a string constant containing the LEN bytes
     at PTR.  PTR will be a C expression of type `char *' and LEN a C
     expression of type `int'.

     If the assembler has a `.ascii' pseudo-op as found in the Berkeley
     Unix assembler, do not define the macro `ASM_OUTPUT_ASCII'.

`CONSTANT_POOL_BEFORE_FUNCTION'
     You may define this macro as a C expression.  You should define the
     expression to have a non-zero value if GNU CC should output the
     constant pool for a function before the code for the function, or
     a zero value if GNU CC should output the constant pool after the
     function.  If you do not define this macro, the usual case, GNU CC
     will output the constant pool before the function.

`ASM_OUTPUT_POOL_PROLOGUE (FILE FUNNAME FUNDECL SIZE)'
     A C statement to output assembler commands to define the start of
     the constant pool for a function.  FUNNAME is a string giving the
     name of the function.  Should the return type of the function be
     required, it can be obtained via FUNDECL.  SIZE is the size, in
     bytes, of the constant pool that will be written immediately after
     this call.

     If no constant-pool prefix is required, the usual case, this macro
     need not be defined.

`ASM_OUTPUT_SPECIAL_POOL_ENTRY (FILE, X, MODE, ALIGN, LABELNO, JUMPTO)'
     A C statement (with or without semicolon) to output a constant in
     the constant pool, if it needs special treatment.  (This macro
     need not do anything for RTL expressions that can be output
     normally.)

     The argument FILE is the standard I/O stream to output the
     assembler code on.  X is the RTL expression for the constant to
     output, and MODE is the machine mode (in case X is a `const_int').
     ALIGN is the required alignment for the value X; you should
     output an assembler directive to force this much alignment.

     The argument LABELNO is a number to use in an internal label for
     the address of this pool entry.  The definition of this macro is
     responsible for outputting the label definition at the proper
     place.  Here is how to do this:

          ASM_OUTPUT_INTERNAL_LABEL (FILE, "LC", LABELNO);

     When you output a pool entry specially, you should end with a
     `goto' to the label JUMPTO.  This will prevent the same pool entry
     from being output a second time in the usual manner.

     You need not define this macro if it would do nothing.

`CONSTANT_AFTER_FUNCTION_P (EXP)'
     Define this macro as a C expression which is nonzero if the
     constant EXP, of type `tree', should be output after the code for a
     function.  The compiler will normally output all constants before
     the function; you need not define this macro if this is OK.

`ASM_OUTPUT_POOL_EPILOGUE (FILE FUNNAME FUNDECL SIZE)'
     A C statement to output assembler commands to at the end of the
     constant pool for a function.  FUNNAME is a string giving the name
     of the function.  Should the return type of the function be
     required, you can obtain it via FUNDECL.  SIZE is the size, in
     bytes, of the constant pool that GNU CC wrote immediately before
     this call.

     If no constant-pool epilogue is required, the usual case, you need
     not define this macro.

`IS_ASM_LOGICAL_LINE_SEPARATOR (C)'
     Define this macro as a C expression which is nonzero if C is used
     as a logical line separator by the assembler.

     If you do not define this macro, the default is that only the
     character `;' is treated as a logical line separator.

`ASM_OPEN_PAREN'
`ASM_CLOSE_PAREN'
     These macros are defined as C string constant, describing the
     syntax in the assembler for grouping arithmetic expressions.  The
     following definitions are correct for most assemblers:

          #define ASM_OPEN_PAREN "("
          #define ASM_CLOSE_PAREN ")"

   These macros are provided by `real.h' for writing the definitions of
`ASM_OUTPUT_DOUBLE' and the like:

`REAL_VALUE_TO_TARGET_SINGLE (X, L)'
`REAL_VALUE_TO_TARGET_DOUBLE (X, L)'
`REAL_VALUE_TO_TARGET_LONG_DOUBLE (X, L)'
     These translate X, of type `REAL_VALUE_TYPE', to the target's
     floating point representation, and store its bit pattern in the
     array of `long int' whose address is L.  The number of elements in
     the output array is determined by the size of the desired target
     floating point data type: 32 bits of it go in each `long int' array
     element.  Each array element holds 32 bits of the result, even if
     `long int' is wider than 32 bits on the host machine.

     The array element values are designed so that you can print them
     out using `fprintf' in the order they should appear in the target
     machine's memory.

`REAL_VALUE_TO_DECIMAL (X, FORMAT, STRING)'
     This macro converts X, of type `REAL_VALUE_TYPE', to a decimal
     number and stores it as a string into STRING.  You must pass, as
     STRING, the address of a long enough block of space to hold the
     result.

     The argument FORMAT is a `printf'-specification that serves as a
     suggestion for how to format the output string.

   Each of the macros in this section is used to do the whole job of
outputting a single uninitialized variable.
d836 2
a837 103
`ASM_OUTPUT_COMMON (STREAM, NAME, SIZE, ROUNDED)'
     A C statement (sans semicolon) to output to the stdio stream
     STREAM the assembler definition of a common-label named NAME whose
     size is SIZE bytes.  The variable ROUNDED is the size rounded up
     to whatever alignment the caller wants.

     Use the expression `assemble_name (STREAM, NAME)' to output the
     name itself; before and after that, output the additional
     assembler syntax for defining the name, and a newline.

     This macro controls how the assembler definitions of uninitialized
     common global variables are output.

`ASM_OUTPUT_ALIGNED_COMMON (STREAM, NAME, SIZE, ALIGNMENT)'
     Like `ASM_OUTPUT_COMMON' except takes the required alignment as a
     separate, explicit argument.  If you define this macro, it is used
     in place of `ASM_OUTPUT_COMMON', and gives you more flexibility in
     handling the required alignment of the variable.  The alignment is
     specified as the number of bits.

`ASM_OUTPUT_ALIGNED_DECL_COMMON (STREAM, DECL, NAME, SIZE, ALIGNMENT)'
     Like `ASM_OUTPUT_ALIGNED_COMMON' except that DECL of the variable
     to be output, if there is one, or `NULL_TREE' if there is not
     corresponding variable.  If you define this macro, GNU CC wil use
     it in place of both `ASM_OUTPUT_COMMON' and
     `ASM_OUTPUT_ALIGNED_COMMON'.  Define this macro when you need to
     see the variable's decl in order to chose what to output.

`ASM_OUTPUT_SHARED_COMMON (STREAM, NAME, SIZE, ROUNDED)'
     If defined, it is similar to `ASM_OUTPUT_COMMON', except that it
     is used when NAME is shared.  If not defined, `ASM_OUTPUT_COMMON'
     will be used.

`ASM_OUTPUT_BSS (STREAM, DECL, NAME, SIZE, ROUNDED)'
     A C statement (sans semicolon) to output to the stdio stream
     STREAM the assembler definition of uninitialized global DECL named
     NAME whose size is SIZE bytes.  The variable ROUNDED is the size
     rounded up to whatever alignment the caller wants.

     Try to use function `asm_output_bss' defined in `varasm.c' when
     defining this macro.  If unable, use the expression `assemble_name
     (STREAM, NAME)' to output the name itself; before and after that,
     output the additional assembler syntax for defining the name, and
     a newline.

     This macro controls how the assembler definitions of uninitialized
     global variables are output.  This macro exists to properly
     support languages like `c++' which do not have `common' data.
     However, this macro currently is not defined for all targets.  If
     this macro and `ASM_OUTPUT_ALIGNED_BSS' are not defined then
     `ASM_OUTPUT_COMMON' or `ASM_OUTPUT_ALIGNED_COMMON' or
     `ASM_OUTPUT_ALIGNED_DECL_COMMON' is used.

`ASM_OUTPUT_ALIGNED_BSS (STREAM, DECL, NAME, SIZE, ALIGNMENT)'
     Like `ASM_OUTPUT_BSS' except takes the required alignment as a
     separate, explicit argument.  If you define this macro, it is used
     in place of `ASM_OUTPUT_BSS', and gives you more flexibility in
     handling the required alignment of the variable.  The alignment is
     specified as the number of bits.

     Try to use function `asm_output_aligned_bss' defined in file
     `varasm.c' when defining this macro.

`ASM_OUTPUT_SHARED_BSS (STREAM, DECL, NAME, SIZE, ROUNDED)'
     If defined, it is similar to `ASM_OUTPUT_BSS', except that it is
     used when NAME is shared.  If not defined, `ASM_OUTPUT_BSS' will
     be used.

`ASM_OUTPUT_LOCAL (STREAM, NAME, SIZE, ROUNDED)'
     A C statement (sans semicolon) to output to the stdio stream
     STREAM the assembler definition of a local-common-label named NAME
     whose size is SIZE bytes.  The variable ROUNDED is the size
     rounded up to whatever alignment the caller wants.

     Use the expression `assemble_name (STREAM, NAME)' to output the
     name itself; before and after that, output the additional
     assembler syntax for defining the name, and a newline.

     This macro controls how the assembler definitions of uninitialized
     static variables are output.

`ASM_OUTPUT_ALIGNED_LOCAL (STREAM, NAME, SIZE, ALIGNMENT)'
     Like `ASM_OUTPUT_LOCAL' except takes the required alignment as a
     separate, explicit argument.  If you define this macro, it is used
     in place of `ASM_OUTPUT_LOCAL', and gives you more flexibility in
     handling the required alignment of the variable.  The alignment is
     specified as the number of bits.

`ASM_OUTPUT_ALIGNED_DECL_LOCAL (STREAM, DECL, NAME, SIZE, ALIGNMENT)'
     Like `ASM_OUTPUT_ALIGNED_DECL' except that DECL of the variable to
     be output, if there is one, or `NULL_TREE' if there is not
     corresponding variable.  If you define this macro, GNU CC wil use
     it in place of both `ASM_OUTPUT_DECL' and
     `ASM_OUTPUT_ALIGNED_DECL'.  Define this macro when you need to see
     the variable's decl in order to chose what to output.

`ASM_OUTPUT_SHARED_LOCAL (STREAM, NAME, SIZE, ROUNDED)'
     If defined, it is similar to `ASM_OUTPUT_LOCAL', except that it is
     used when NAME is shared.  If not defined, `ASM_OUTPUT_LOCAL' will
     be used.

   This is about outputting labels.
d846 3
a848 225
`ASM_OUTPUT_LABEL (STREAM, NAME)'
     A C statement (sans semicolon) to output to the stdio stream
     STREAM the assembler definition of a label named NAME.  Use the
     expression `assemble_name (STREAM, NAME)' to output the name
     itself; before and after that, output the additional assembler
     syntax for defining the name, and a newline.

`ASM_DECLARE_FUNCTION_NAME (STREAM, NAME, DECL)'
     A C statement (sans semicolon) to output to the stdio stream
     STREAM any text necessary for declaring the name NAME of a
     function which is being defined.  This macro is responsible for
     outputting the label definition (perhaps using
     `ASM_OUTPUT_LABEL').  The argument DECL is the `FUNCTION_DECL'
     tree node representing the function.

     If this macro is not defined, then the function name is defined in
     the usual manner as a label (by means of `ASM_OUTPUT_LABEL').

`ASM_DECLARE_FUNCTION_SIZE (STREAM, NAME, DECL)'
     A C statement (sans semicolon) to output to the stdio stream
     STREAM any text necessary for declaring the size of a function
     which is being defined.  The argument NAME is the name of the
     function.  The argument DECL is the `FUNCTION_DECL' tree node
     representing the function.

     If this macro is not defined, then the function size is not
     defined.

`ASM_DECLARE_OBJECT_NAME (STREAM, NAME, DECL)'
     A C statement (sans semicolon) to output to the stdio stream
     STREAM any text necessary for declaring the name NAME of an
     initialized variable which is being defined.  This macro must
     output the label definition (perhaps using `ASM_OUTPUT_LABEL').
     The argument DECL is the `VAR_DECL' tree node representing the
     variable.

     If this macro is not defined, then the variable name is defined in
     the usual manner as a label (by means of `ASM_OUTPUT_LABEL').

`ASM_FINISH_DECLARE_OBJECT (STREAM, DECL, TOPLEVEL, ATEND)'
     A C statement (sans semicolon) to finish up declaring a variable
     name once the compiler has processed its initializer fully and
     thus has had a chance to determine the size of an array when
     controlled by an initializer.  This is used on systems where it's
     necessary to declare something about the size of the object.

     If you don't define this macro, that is equivalent to defining it
     to do nothing.

`ASM_GLOBALIZE_LABEL (STREAM, NAME)'
     A C statement (sans semicolon) to output to the stdio stream
     STREAM some commands that will make the label NAME global; that
     is, available for reference from other files.  Use the expression
     `assemble_name (STREAM, NAME)' to output the name itself; before
     and after that, output the additional assembler syntax for making
     that name global, and a newline.

`ASM_WEAKEN_LABEL'
     A C statement (sans semicolon) to output to the stdio stream
     STREAM some commands that will make the label NAME weak; that is,
     available for reference from other files but only used if no other
     definition is available.  Use the expression `assemble_name
     (STREAM, NAME)' to output the name itself; before and after that,
     output the additional assembler syntax for making that name weak,
     and a newline.

     If you don't define this macro, GNU CC will not support weak
     symbols and you should not define the `SUPPORTS_WEAK' macro.

`SUPPORTS_WEAK'
     A C expression which evaluates to true if the target supports weak
     symbols.

     If you don't define this macro, `defaults.h' provides a default
     definition.  If `ASM_WEAKEN_LABEL' is defined, the default
     definition is `1'; otherwise, it is `0'.  Define this macro if you
     want to control weak symbol support with a compiler flag such as
     `-melf'.

`MAKE_DECL_ONE_ONLY'
     A C statement (sans semicolon) to mark DECL to be emitted as a
     public symbol such that extra copies in multiple translation units
     will be discarded by the linker.  Define this macro if your object
     file format provides support for this concept, such as the `COMDAT'
     section flags in the Microsoft Windows PE/COFF format, and this
     support requires changes to DECL, such as putting it in a separate
     section.

`SUPPORTS_ONE_ONLY'
     A C expression which evaluates to true if the target supports
     one-only semantics.

     If you don't define this macro, `varasm.c' provides a default
     definition.  If `MAKE_DECL_ONE_ONLY' is defined, the default
     definition is `1'; otherwise, it is `0'.  Define this macro if you
     want to control one-only symbol support with a compiler flag, or if
     setting the `DECL_ONE_ONLY' flag is enough to mark a declaration to
     be emitted as one-only.

`ASM_OUTPUT_EXTERNAL (STREAM, DECL, NAME)'
     A C statement (sans semicolon) to output to the stdio stream
     STREAM any text necessary for declaring the name of an external
     symbol named NAME which is referenced in this compilation but not
     defined.  The value of DECL is the tree node for the declaration.

     This macro need not be defined if it does not need to output
     anything.  The GNU assembler and most Unix assemblers don't
     require anything.

`ASM_OUTPUT_EXTERNAL_LIBCALL (STREAM, SYMREF)'
     A C statement (sans semicolon) to output on STREAM an assembler
     pseudo-op to declare a library function name external.  The name
     of the library function is given by SYMREF, which has type `rtx'
     and is a `symbol_ref'.

     This macro need not be defined if it does not need to output
     anything.  The GNU assembler and most Unix assemblers don't
     require anything.

`ASM_OUTPUT_LABELREF (STREAM, NAME)'
     A C statement (sans semicolon) to output to the stdio stream
     STREAM a reference in assembler syntax to a label named NAME.
     This should add `_' to the front of the name, if that is customary
     on your operating system, as it is in most Berkeley Unix systems.
     This macro is used in `assemble_name'.

`ASM_OUTPUT_INTERNAL_LABEL (STREAM, PREFIX, NUM)'
     A C statement to output to the stdio stream STREAM a label whose
     name is made from the string PREFIX and the number NUM.

     It is absolutely essential that these labels be distinct from the
     labels used for user-level functions and variables.  Otherwise,
     certain programs will have name conflicts with internal labels.

     It is desirable to exclude internal labels from the symbol table
     of the object file.  Most assemblers have a naming convention for
     labels that should be excluded; on many systems, the letter `L' at
     the beginning of a label has this effect.  You should find out what
     convention your system uses, and follow it.

     The usual definition of this macro is as follows:

          fprintf (STREAM, "L%s%d:\n", PREFIX, NUM)

`ASM_GENERATE_INTERNAL_LABEL (STRING, PREFIX, NUM)'
     A C statement to store into the string STRING a label whose name
     is made from the string PREFIX and the number NUM.

     This string, when output subsequently by `assemble_name', should
     produce the output that `ASM_OUTPUT_INTERNAL_LABEL' would produce
     with the same PREFIX and NUM.

     If the string begins with `*', then `assemble_name' will output
     the rest of the string unchanged.  It is often convenient for
     `ASM_GENERATE_INTERNAL_LABEL' to use `*' in this way.  If the
     string doesn't start with `*', then `ASM_OUTPUT_LABELREF' gets to
     output the string, and may change it.  (Of course,
     `ASM_OUTPUT_LABELREF' is also part of your machine description, so
     you should know what it does on your machine.)

`ASM_FORMAT_PRIVATE_NAME (OUTVAR, NAME, NUMBER)'
     A C expression to assign to OUTVAR (which is a variable of type
     `char *') a newly allocated string made from the string NAME and
     the number NUMBER, with some suitable punctuation added.  Use
     `alloca' to get space for the string.

     The string will be used as an argument to `ASM_OUTPUT_LABELREF' to
     produce an assembler label for an internal static variable whose
     name is NAME.  Therefore, the string must be such as to result in
     valid assembler code.  The argument NUMBER is different each time
     this macro is executed; it prevents conflicts between
     similarly-named internal static variables in different scopes.

     Ideally this string should not be a valid C identifier, to prevent
     any conflict with the user's own symbols.  Most assemblers allow
     periods or percent signs in assembler symbols; putting at least
     one of these between the name and the number will suffice.

`ASM_OUTPUT_DEF (STREAM, NAME, VALUE)'
     A C statement to output to the stdio stream STREAM assembler code
     which defines (equates) the symbol NAME to have the value VALUE.

     If SET_ASM_OP is defined, a default definition is provided which is
     correct for most systems.

`ASM_OUTPUT_DEFINE_LABEL_DIFFERENCE_SYMBOL (STREAM, SYMBOL, HIGH, LOW)'
     A C statement to output to the stdio stream STREAM assembler code
     which defines (equates) the symbol SYMBOL to have a value equal to
     the difference of the two symbols HIGH and LOW, i.e.  HIGH minus
     LOW.  GNU CC guarantees that the symbols HIGH and LOW are already
     known by the assembler so that the difference resolves into a
     constant.

     If SET_ASM_OP is defined, a default definition is provided which is
     correct for most systems.

`ASM_OUTPUT_WEAK_ALIAS (STREAM, NAME, VALUE)'
     A C statement to output to the stdio stream STREAM assembler code
     which defines (equates) the weak symbol NAME to have the value
     VALUE.

     Define this macro if the target only supports weak aliases; define
     ASM_OUTPUT_DEF instead if possible.

`OBJC_GEN_METHOD_LABEL (BUF, IS_INST, CLASS_NAME, CAT_NAME, SEL_NAME)'
     Define this macro to override the default assembler names used for
     Objective C methods.

     The default name is a unique method number followed by the name of
     the class (e.g. `_1_Foo').  For methods in categories, the name of
     the category is also included in the assembler name (e.g.
     `_1_Foo_Bar').

     These names are safe on most systems, but make debugging difficult
     since the method's selector is not present in the name.
     Therefore, particular systems define other ways of computing names.

     BUF is an expression of type `char *' which gives you a buffer in
     which to store the name; its length is as long as CLASS_NAME,
     CAT_NAME and SEL_NAME put together, plus 50 characters extra.

     The argument IS_INST specifies whether the method is an instance
     method or a class method; CLASS_NAME is the name of the class;
     CAT_NAME is the name of the category (or NULL if the method is not
     in a category); and SEL_NAME is the name of the selector.

     On systems where the assembler can handle quoted names, you can
     use this macro to provide more human-readable names.
