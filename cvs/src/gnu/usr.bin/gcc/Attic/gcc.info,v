@First cut at making a minimal intrusive munge of gcc to fit in a BSD
framework.  This means, provide a Makefile.bsd-wrapper.  Remove
intermediate files from the source dir.  Build them in the obj-dir.
Add some Makefile hooks so we can tune the std Makefile for our
purpose but still have it behave normal for out-of-tree
configurations.  Only i386 is supported for now.  The other archs will
follow soon.   This checkin requires an existing makeinfo and a yacc
that accepts -o.

@This is Info file gcc.info, produced by Makeinfo-1.63 from the input
file gcc.texi.

   This file documents the use and the internals of the GNU compiler.
