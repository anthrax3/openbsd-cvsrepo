@sync g77 to version 0.5.20 - i hope i got everything right because there
is no patch from 0.5.19 to 0.5.20 - so i did it by diffing two gcc trees
looking carefully at the results

what does the new g77 give us:
* now it completely works on the alpha (64bit)
* faster
* less bugs :-)

/* Emit RTL insns to initialize the variable parts of a trampoline.
   FNADDR is an RTX for the address of the function's pure code.
   CXT is an RTX for the static chain value for the function. 

   This differs from the standard version in that:

   We do not initialize the "hint" field because it only has an 8k
   range and so the target is in range of something on the stack. 
   Omitting the hint saves a bogus branch-prediction cache line load.

   GNU/Linux always has an executable stack -- no need for a system call. */
