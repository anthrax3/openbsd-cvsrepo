/* If compiling with DECC, need to fix problem with <stdio.h>
   which defines a macro called FILE_TYPE that breaks "tree.h".
   Fortunately it uses #ifndef to suppress multiple inclusions.
   Three possible cases:
        1) <stdio.h> has already been included -- ours will be no-op;
        2) <stdio.h> will be included after us -- "theirs" will be no-op;
        3) <stdio.h> isn't needed -- including it here shouldn't hurt.
   In all three cases, the problem macro will be removed here.  */

@These files were new in the 2.8 import (into the FSF branch) and cvs is stupid
enough to think my branch import want s the new files to end up in the trunk
as well.  Maybe cvs know how to do what I want, but I could not find it in
the manpage
