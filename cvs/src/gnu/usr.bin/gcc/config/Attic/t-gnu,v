# The pushl in CTOR initialization interferes with frame pointer elimination.

# We need to use -fPIC when we are using gcc to compile the routines in
# crtstuff.c.  This is only really needed when we are going to use gcc/g++
# to produce a shared library, but since we don't know ahead of time when
# we will be doing that, we just always use -fPIC when compiling the
# routines in crtstuff.c.

@These files were new in the 2.8 import (into the FSF branch) and cvs is stupid
enough to think my branch import want s the new files to end up in the trunk
as well.  Maybe cvs know how to do what I want, but I could not find it in
the manpage
