@# It is defined in config/xm-linux.h.
# X_CFLAGS = -DPOSIX

# The following is needed when compiling stages 2 and 3 because gcc's
# limits.h must be picked up before /usr/include/limits.h.  This is because
# each does an #include_next of the other if the other hasn't been included.
# /usr/include/limits.h loses if it gets found first because /usr/include is
# at the end of the search order.  When a new version of gcc is released,
# gcc's limits.h hasn't been installed yet and hence isn't found.

@sync g77 to version 0.5.20 - i hope i got everything right because there
is no patch from 0.5.19 to 0.5.20 - so i did it by diffing two gcc trees
looking carefully at the results

what does the new g77 give us:
* now it completely works on the alpha (64bit)
* faster
* less bugs :-)
