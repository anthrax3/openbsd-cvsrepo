   assembler, or (2) assemble a stub routine with gas and edit the object
   file.  This solution has the advantage that it can interoperate with
   the A/UX version and can be used in an eventual port of glibc to A/UX.  */

@These files were new in the 2.8 import (into the FSF branch) and cvs is stupid
enough to think my branch import want s the new files to end up in the trunk
as well.  Maybe cvs know how to do what I want, but I could not find it in
the manpage
