@Kill files that reference config/xm-openbsd.h, these are no longer
used, since they would make an error.

Kill xm-powerpc.h along: it's actually a less advanced version of xm-rs6000.h.

Keep ns32k/xm-openbsd.h around, as it used to do something non trivial.

pa/xm-openbsd.h is actually still in use, so don't touch it.
