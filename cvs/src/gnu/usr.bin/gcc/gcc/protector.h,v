log
@Remove the ``addressable'' argument to search_string_def(). Turned out to be
a bad idea, for it causes false positives, which then can cause ICE trying
to protect narrower-than-int incoming arguments, if building with
-fstack-protector-all.

From etoh@@'s gcc 3.4 tree, unbreaks -fstack-protector-all on m88k (well, maybe
not completely, but it makes it compile more files, such as pf.c which contains
functions receiving uint16_t arguments pushed on the stack due to the
exhaustion of caller-saved registers).

@Add strong stack protector mode for the original propolice in GCC3.
This includes additional functions to be protected --- those that
have local array definitions, or have references to local frame
addresses.

Miod verified that this works on real hardware, and not just on the
cross-compiled monster I tested this on.
