   for other svr4 tools (e.g. ld) or with other options for GCC itself.
   For example, we don't support the -o (output file) or -R (remove
   input file) options because GCC already handles these things.  We
   also don't support the -m (run m4) option for the assembler because
   that conflicts with the -m (produce load map) option of the svr4
   linker.  We do however allow passing arbitrary options to the svr4

   allow us to link things in one of these three modes by applying the
   appropriate combinations of options at link-time.  We also provide
   support here for as many of the other svr4 linker options as seems
   reasonable, given that some of them conflict with options for other
   svr4 tools (e.g. the assembler).  In particular, we do support the
   -z*, -V, -b, -t, -Qy, -Qn, and -YP* options here, and the -e*,
   -l*, -o*, -r, -s, -u*, and -L* options are directly supported
   by gcc.c itself.  We don't directly support the -m (generate load
   map) option because that conflicts with the -m (run m4) option of
   the svr4 assembler.  We also don't directly support the svr4 linker's
   -I* or -M* options because these conflict with existing GCC options.
   We do however allow passing arbitrary options to the svr4 linker
   via the -Wl, option.  We don't support the svr4 linker's -a option
   at all because it is totally useless and because it conflicts with
   GCC's own -a option.
