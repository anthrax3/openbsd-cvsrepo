@Explicitely define USE_GAS for OpenBSD targets; the configure machinery in
gcc 3 no longer defines this for us.

1.1
log
@Stop including other files in m88k/openbsd.h; instead specific the complete list
of files to include, in proper order, as tm_file at configure time. This
requires openbsd.h to be split, as also encountered on other platforms, and will
make further work easier.
No functional change introduced.
