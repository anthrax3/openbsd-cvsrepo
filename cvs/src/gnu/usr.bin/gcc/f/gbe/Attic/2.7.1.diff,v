@sync g77 to version 0.5.20 - i hope i got everything right because there
is no patch from 0.5.19 to 0.5.20 - so i did it by diffing two gcc trees
looking carefully at the results

what does the new g77 give us:
* now it completely works on the alpha (64bit)
* faster
* less bugs :-)

This file would have been 124K long in the g77-0.5.18 distribution,
so, since 2.7.2.diff is available, this file has been omitted.
If you insist on using gcc-2.7.1 with g77-0.5.18, you should be
okay, except you won't get some of the nifty new optimizations.
