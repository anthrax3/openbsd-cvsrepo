TODO list for the g77 library

* `Makefile.in's should be tarted up to standard; I'm not sure they
  have a complete set of targets at present.

* Investigate building shared libraries on systems we know about.

* Test cases.

* Allow the library to be stripped to save space.

* libU77-type routines (and interface to much of libc).  Some work has
  already been done on this: ask d.love@@dl.ac.uk.

* An interface to IEEE maths functions from libc where this makes
  sense.

* TeXinfo Documentation of the user-callable routines.

@sync g77 to version 0.5.20 - i hope i got everything right because there
is no patch from 0.5.19 to 0.5.20 - so i did it by diffing two gcc trees
looking carefully at the results

what does the new g77 give us:
* now it completely works on the alpha (64bit)
* faster
* less bugs :-)
