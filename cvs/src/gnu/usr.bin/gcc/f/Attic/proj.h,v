/* This file used to attempt to allow for all sorts of broken systems.
   Because the auto-configuration scripts in conf-proj(.in) didn't work
   on all systems, and I received far too many bug reports about them,
   I decided to stop trying to cater to broken systems at all, and
   simply remove all but the simplest and most useful code (which is
   still in proj.c).

   So, if you find your system can't link because bsearch() or strtoul()
   aren't found, please just fix your system, or hand-edit the code
   below as appropriate.  I DO NOT WANT ANY "BUG REPORTS" ABOUT THIS.
   g77 requires a working ANSI C environment, and if bsearch() and strtoul()
   do not exist, or if <assert.h> isn't found, etc., then you don't have
   one, and it is not g77's fault.  If it turns out g77 is simply
   referring to the wrong system header file -- something I can verify
   myself using my copy of the ANSI C standard -- I would like to know
   about that.  Otherwise, g77 is not the place to fix problems with your
   ANSI C implementation, though perhaps gcc might be.

@sync g77 to version 0.5.20 - i hope i got everything right because there
is no patch from 0.5.19 to 0.5.20 - so i did it by diffing two gcc trees
looking carefully at the results

what does the new g77 give us:
* now it completely works on the alpha (64bit)
* faster
* less bugs :-)
