# INPUT:
# btest <target> <source> <prefix> <state> <build>
# TARGET is the target triplet.  It should be the same one as used in
# constructing PREFIX.  Or it can be the keyword 'native', indicating
# a target of whatever platform the script is running on.
TARGET=$1
# SOURCE is the directory containing the toplevel configure.

# PREFIX is the directory for the --prefix option to configure.

# STATE is where the tester maintains its internal state,

# BUILD is a temporary directory that this script will
#   delete and recreate, containing the build tree.

# you also probably need to set these variables:
# DEJAGNU: should point to a site.exp suitable for testing
#   the compiler and debugger.

# OUTPUT: in $RESULT, one of the following keywords:
#   error	the script failed due to
#		a misconfiguration or resource limitation
#   build	the build failed
#   regress-<n>	the build succeeded, but there were <n>
#		testsuite regressions, listed in $REGRESS
