@$CVSid: @@(#)README 1.12 94/09/25 $

This "contrib" directory is a place holder for code/scripts sent to
me by contributors around the world.  This READM file will be kept
up-to-date from release to release.  BUT, I must point out that these
contributions are really, REALLY UNSSUPPORTED.  In fact, I probably
don't even know what they do.  Nor do I guarantee to have tried them,
or ported them to work with this CVS distribution.  If you have questions,
you might contact the author, but you should not necessarily expect
a reply.  USE AT YOUR OWN RISK -- and all that stuff.

Contents of this directory:

	README		This file.
	log		A perl script suitable for including in your
			$CVSROOT/CVSROOT/loginfo file for logging commit
			changes.  Includes the RCS revision of the change
			as part of the log.
			Contributed by Kevin Samborn <samborn@@sunrise.com>.
	pcl-cvs		A directory that contains GNU Emacs lisp code which
			implements a CVS-mode for emacs.
			Contributed by Per Cederqvist <ceder@@lysator.liu.se>.
	commit_prep	A perl script, to be combined with log_accum.pl, to
	log_accum	provide for a way to combine the individual log
			messages of a multi-directory "commit" into a
			single log message, and mail the result somewhere.
			Also does other checks for $Id and that you are
			committing the correct revision of the file.
			Read the comments carefully.
			Contributed by David Hampton <hampton@@cisco.com>.
	mfpipe		Another perl script for logging.  Allows you to
			pipe the log message to a file and/or send mail
			to some alias.
			Contributed by John Clyne <clyne@@niwot.scd.ucar.edu>.
	rcs-to-cvs	Script to import sources that may have been under
			RCS control already.
			Contributed by Per Cederqvist <ceder@@lysator.liu.se>.
	cvscheck	Identifies files added, changed, or removed in a
	cvscheck.man	checked out CVS tree; also notices unknown files.
			Contributed by Lowell Skoog <fluke!lowell@@uunet.uu.net>
	cvshelp.man	An introductory manual page written by Lowell Skoog
			<fluke!lowell@@uunet.uu.net>.  It is most likely
			out-of-date relative to CVS 1.3, but still may be
			useful.
	dirfns		A shar file which contains some code that might
			help your system support opendir/readdir/closedir,
			if it does not already.
			Copied from the C-News distribution.
	rcslock		A perl script that can be added to your commitinfo
			file that tries to determine if your RCS file is
			currently locked by someone else, as might be the
			case for a binary file.
			Contributed by John Rouillard <rouilj@@cs.umb.edu>.
	ccvs-rsh	A Perl script which allows "rsh pipelines" to
			be built in order to use Cyclic CVS from
			behind some varieties of firewall.
	cvs_acls	A perl script that implements Access Control Lists
			by using the "commitinfo" hook provided with the
			"cvs commit" command.
			Contributed by David G. Grubbs <dgg@@ksr.com>.
	descend		A shell script that can be used to recursively
	descend.man	descend through a directory.  In CVS 1.2, this was
			very useful, since many of the commands were not
			recursive.  In CVS 1.3 (and later), however, most of
			the commands are recursive.  However, this may still
			come in handy.
			Contributed by Lowell Skoog <fluke!lowell@@uunet.uu.net>
	cln_hist	A perl script to compress your
			$CVSROOT/CVSROOT/history file, as it can grow quite
			large after extended use.
			Contributed by David G. Grubbs <dgg@@ksr.com>
	sccs2rcs	A C-shell script that can convert (some) SCCS files
			into RCS files, retaining the info contained in the
			SCCS file (like dates, author, and log message).
			Contributed by Ken Cox <kenstir@@viewlogic.com>.
	intro.doc	A user's view of what you need to know to get
			started with CVS.
			Contributed by <Steven.Pemberton@@cwi.nl>.
	rcs2sccs	A shell script to convert simple RCS files into
			SCCS files, originally gleaned off the network
			somewhere (originally by "kenc") and modified by
			Jerry Jelinek <jerry@@rmtc.Central.Sun.COM> and
			Brian Berliner <berliner@@sun.com> to increase
			robustness and add support for one-level of branches.
	rcs2log		A shell script to create a ChangeLog-format file
			given only a set of RCS files.
			Contributed by Paul Eggert <eggert@@twinsun.com>.
 	clmerge		A perl script to handle merge conflicts in GNU
			style ChangeLog files .
			Contributed by Tom Tromey <tromey@@busco.lanl.gov>.

"Unsupported" also means that no one has volunteered to accept and check
in changes to this directory.  So submissions for new scripts to add
here are unlikely to be accepted.  Suggested changes to the existing
scripts here conceivably might, but that isn't clear either, unless of
course they come from the original author of the script.

If you have some software that works with CVS that you wish to offer it
is suggested that you make it available by FTP or HTTP and then announce
it on the info-cvs mailing list.
