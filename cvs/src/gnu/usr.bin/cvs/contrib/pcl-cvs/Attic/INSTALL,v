Installation of the pcl-cvs program
===================================

  1. Edit the file `Makefile' to reflect the situation at your site.
     The only things you have to change is the definition of `lispdir'
     and `infodir'.  The elisp files will be copied to `lispdir', and
     the info file to `infodir'.

  2. Configure pcl-cvs.el

     There are a couple of paths that you have to check to make sure
     that they match you system.  They appear early in the file
     pcl-cvs.el.

     *NOTE:*  If your system is running emacs 18.57 or earlier you
     MUST uncomment the line that says:

          (setq delete-exited-processes nil)

     Setting `delete-exited-processes' to `nil' works around a bug in
     emacs that causes it to dump core.  The bug was fixed in emacs
     18.58.

  3. Release 1.05 and later of pcl-cvs requires parts of the Elib
     library, version 0.07 or later.  Elib is available via anonymous
     ftp from prep.ai.mit.edu in `pub/gnu/elib-0.07.tar.z', and from
     a lot of other sites that mirrors prep.  Get Elib, and install
     it, before proceeding.

  4. Type `make install' in the source directory.  This will
     byte-compile all `.el' files and copy both the `.el' and the
     `.elc' into the directory you specified in step 1.

     If you don't want to install the `.el' files but only the `.elc'
     files (the byte-compiled files), you can type ``make
     install_elc'' instead of ``make install''.

     If you only want to create the compiled elisp files, but don't
     want to install them, you can type `make elcfiles' instead. 
     This is what happens if you only type `make' without parameters.

  5. Edit the file `default.el' in your emacs lisp directory (usually
     `/usr/gnu/emacs/lisp' or something similar) and enter the
     contents of the file `pcl-cvs-startup.el' into it.  It contains
     a couple of `auto-load's that facilitates the use of pcl-cvs.



Installation of the on-line manual.
===================================

  1. Move the info file `pcl-cvs.info' to your standard info
     directory.  This might be called something like
     `/usr/gnu/emacs/info'.

  2. Edit the file `dir' in the info directory and enter one line to
     contain a pointer to the info file `pcl-cvs.info'.  The line can,
     for instance, look like this:

          * Pcl-cvs: (pcl-cvs.info).       An Emacs front-end to CVS.


How to make the on-line manual from pcl-cvs.texinfo
===================================================

  1. Create the info file `pcl-cvs.info' from `pcl-cvs.texinfo' by
     typing `make info'.  If you don't have the program `makeinfo' you
     can get it by anonymous ftp from e.g. `ftp.gnu.ai.mit.edu' as
     `pub/gnu/texinfo-2.14.tar.Z' (there might be a newer version
     there when you read this).


How to make typeset documentation from pcl-cvs.texinfo
======================================================

   If you have TeX installed at your site, you can make a typeset
manual from `pcl-cvs.texinfo'.

  1. Run TeX by typing ``make pcl-cvs.dvi''.  You will not get the
     indices unless you have the `texindex' program.

  2. Convert the resulting device independent file `pcl-cvs.dvi' to a
     form which your printer can output and print it.  If you have a
     postscript printer there is a program, `dvi2ps', which does. 
     There is also a program which comes together with TeX, `dvips',
     which you can use.

  1. Possibly edit the file `Makefile' to reflect the situation at your
     site.  We say "possibly" because the version of pcl-cvs included
     with CVS uses a configuration mechanism integrated with the overall
     mechanisms used by the CVS build and install procedures.  Thus the
     file `Makefile' will be generated automatically from the file
     `Makefile.in', and it should not be necessary to edit it further.

     If you do have to edit the `Makefile', the only things you have to
     change is the definition of `lispdir' and `infodir'.  The elisp
     files will be copied to `lispdir', and the info file(s) to
     `infodir'.
