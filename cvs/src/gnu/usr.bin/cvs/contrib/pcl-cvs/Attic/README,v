@Integrate local changes to CVS; remove files no longer part of the CVS

This is the readme file for pcl-cvs, release 1.05.

This release of pcl-cvs requires Elib 0.07 or later.  Elib is no
longer distributed with pcl-cvs, since that caused too much confusion.
You can get Elib from ftp.lysator.liu.se in pub/emacs/elib-*.tar.?.

Pcl-cvs is a front-end to CVS version 1.3.  It integrates the most
frequently used CVS commands into emacs.

There is some configuration that needs to be done in pcl-cvs.el to get
it to work.  See the instructions in file INSTALL.

Full documentation is in pcl-cvs.texinfo.  Since it requires makeinfo
version 2 or 3 a preformatted info file is also included (pcl-cvs.info).

If you have been using a previous version of pcl-cvs (for instance
1.02 which is distributed with CVS 1.3) you should read through the
file NEWS to see what has changed.

This release has been tested under Emacs 18.59, Emacs 19.28 and Lucid
Emacs 19.6.  Emacs 19.10 unfortunately has a file named cookie.el that
collides with the cookie.el that is distributed in Elib.  This
conflict was resolved in 19.11.  For earlier versions, there are
instructions in Elib 0.07 for how to work around the problem.
