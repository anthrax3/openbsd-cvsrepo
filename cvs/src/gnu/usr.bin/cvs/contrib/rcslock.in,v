# -*-Perl-*-

# Author: John Rouillard (rouilj@@cs.umb.edu)
# Supported: Yeah right. (Well what do you expect for 2 hours work?)
# Blame-to: rouilj@@cs.umb.edu
# Complaints to: Anybody except Brian Berliner, he's blameless for
#		 this script.
# Acknowlegements: The base code for this script has been acquired
# 		   from the log.pl script.

# rcslock.pl - A program to prevent commits when a file to be ckecked
# 	       in is locked in the repository.

# There are times when you need exclusive access to a file.  This
# often occurs when binaries are checked into the repository, since
# cvs's (actually rcs's) text based merging mechanism won't work. This
# script allows you to use the rcs lock mechanism (rcs -l) to make
# sure that no changes to a repository are able to be committed if
# those changes would result in a locked file being changed.

# WARNING:
# This script will work only if locking is set to strict.
#

# Setup:
# Add the following line to the commitinfo file:

#         ALL /local/location/for/script/lockcheck [options]

# Where ALL is replaced by any suitable regular expression.
# Options are -v for verbose info, or -d for debugging info.
# The %s will provide the repository directory name and the names of
# all changed files.  

# Use:
# When a developer needs exclusive access to a version of a file, s/he
# should use "rcs -l" in the repository tree to lock the version they
# are working on.  CVS will automagically release the lock when the
# commit is performed.

# Method:
# An "rlog -h" is exec'ed to give info on all about to be
# committed files.  This (header) information is parsed to determine
# if any locks are outstanding and what versions of the file are
# locked.  This filename, version number info is used to index an
# associative array.  All of the files to be committed are checked to
# see if any locks are outstanding.  If locks are outstanding, the
# version number of the current file (taken from the CVS/Entries
# subdirectory) is used in the key to determine if that version is
# locked. If the file being checked in is locked by the person doing
# the checkin, the commit is allowed, but if the lock is held on that
# version of a file by another person, the commit is not allowed.
