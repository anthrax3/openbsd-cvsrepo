 * switches to run as the appropriate user once authentication is
 * complete.  But no actual shell is ever started by that user, so the
 * PATH environment variable may not contain the directory with the
 * RCS binaries, even though if that user logged in normally, PATH
 * would include the directory.  
 *
 * One way to solve this problem is to set RCSBIN_DFLT here.  An
 * alternative is to make sure that root has the right directory in
 * its path already.  Another, probably better alternative is to
