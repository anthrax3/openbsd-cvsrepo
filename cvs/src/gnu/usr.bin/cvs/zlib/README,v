log
@Initial revision

@zlib 1.0.4 is a general purpose data compression library.  All the code
is reentrant (thread safe).  The data format used by the zlib library
is described by RFCs (Request for Comments) 1950 to 1952 in the files 
ftp://ds.internic.net/rfc/rfc1950.txt (zlib format), rfc1951.txt (deflate
format) and rfc1952.txt (gzip format). These documents are also available in
other formats from ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/png/documents/zlib/zdoc-index.html

All functions of the compression library are documented in the file
zlib.h. A usage example of the library is given in the file example.c
which also tests that the library is working correctly. Another
example is given in the file minigzip.c. The compression library itself
is composed of all source files except example.c and minigzip.c.

To compile all files and run the test program, follow the instructions
given at the top of Makefile. In short "make test; make install"
should work for most machines.  For MSDOS, use one of the special
makefiles such as Makefile.msc; for VMS, use Make_vms.com or descrip.mms.

Questions about zlib should be sent to <zlib@@quest.jpl.nasa.gov> or,
if this fails, to the addresses given below in the Copyright section.
The zlib home page is http://quest.jpl.nasa.gov/zlib/

The changes made in version 1.0.4 are documented in the file ChangeLog.
The main changes since 1.0.3 are:

- In very rare conditions, deflate(s, Z_FINISH) could fail to produce an EOF
  bit, so the decompressor could decompress all the correct data but went
  on to attempt decompressing extra garbage data. This affected minigzip too.
- zlibVersion and gzerror return const char* (needed for DLL)
- port to RISCOS (no fdopen, no multiple dots, no unlink, no fileno)


A Perl interface to zlib written by Paul Marquess <pmarquess@@bfsec.bt.co.uk>
is in the CPAN (Comprehensive Perl Archive Network) sites, such as:
ftp://ftp.cis.ufl.edu/pub/perl/CPAN/modules/by-module/Compress/Compress-Zlib*


Notes for some targets:

- For Turbo C the small model is supported only with reduced performance to
  avoid any far allocation; it was tested with -DMAX_WBITS=11 -DMAX_MEM_LEVEL=3

- For 64-bit Iris, deflate.c must be compiled without any optimization.
  With -O, one libpng test fails. The test works in 32 bit mode (with
  the -32 compiler flag). The compiler bug has been reported to SGI.

- zlib doesn't work with gcc 2.6.3 on a DEC 3000/300LX under OSF/1 2.1   
  it works when compiled with cc.

- zlib doesn't work on HP-UX 9.05 with one cc compiler (the one not
  accepting the -O option). It works with the other cc compiler.

- To build a Windows DLL version, include in a DLL project zlib.def, zlib.rc
  and all .c files except example.c and minigzip.c; compile with -DZLIB_DLL
  For help on building a zlib DLL, contact Alessandro Iacopetti
  <iaco@@email.alessandria.alpcom.it>  http://lisa.unial.it/iaco ,
  or contact Brad Clarke <bclarke@@cyberus.ca>.

- gzdopen is not supported on RISCOS

  and zlib specifications were written by Peter Deutsch. Thanks to all the

Mark Nelson <markn@@tiny.com> wrote an article about zlib for the Jan. 1997
issue of  Dr. Dobb's Journal; a copy of the article is available in
http://web2.airmail.net/markn/articles/zlibtool/zlibtool.htm

The changes made in version 1.1.3 are documented in the file ChangeLog.
The main changes since 1.1.2 are:

- fix "an inflate input buffer bug that shows up on rare but persistent
  occasions" (Mark)
- fix gzread and gztell for concatenated .gz files (Didier Le Botlan)
- fix gzseek(..., SEEK_SET) in write mode
- fix crc check after a gzeek (Frank Faubert)
- fix miniunzip when the last entry in a zip file is itself a zip file
  (J Lillge)
- add contrib/asm586 and contrib/asm686 (Brian Raiter)
  See http://www.muppetlabs.com/~breadbox/software/assembly.html
- add support for Delphi 3 in contrib/delphi (Bob Dellaca)
- add support for C++Builder 3 and Delphi 3 in contrib/delphi2 (Davide Moretti)
- do not exit prematurely in untgz if 0 at start of block (Magnus Holmgren)
- use macro EXTERN instead of extern to support DLL for BeOS (Sander Stoks)
- added a FAQ file

plus many changes for portability.

  The zlib DLL support was initially done by Alessandro Iacopetti and is
  now maintained by Gilles Vollant <info@@winimage.com>. Check the zlib DLL

  From Visual Basic, you can call the DLL functions which do not take
  a structure as argument: compress, uncompress and all gz* functions.
