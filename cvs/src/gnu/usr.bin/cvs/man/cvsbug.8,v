cvsbug \- send problem report (PR) about CVS to a central support site
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B cvsbug
[
.I site
]
[
.B \-f
.I problem-report
]
[
.B \-t
.I mail-address
]

[

]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B cvsbug
is a tool used to submit 
.I problem reports 
.\" SITE ADMINISTRATORS - change this if you use a local default
(PRs) to a central support site.  In most cases the correct 
.I site
will be the default.  This argument indicates the support site which
is responsible for the category of problem involved.  Some sites may
use a local address as a default.  
.I site
values are defined by using the 
.BR aliases (5).
.LP
.B cvsbug
invokes an editor on a problem report template (after trying to fill
in some fields with reasonable default values).  When you exit the
editor,
.B cvsbug 
sends the completed form to the
.I Problem Report Management System
(\fBGNATS\fR) at a central support site.  At the support site, the PR
is assigned a unique number and is stored in the \fBGNATS\fR database
according to its category and submitter-id.  \fBGNATS\fR automatically
replies with an acknowledgement, citing the category and the PR
number.
.LP
To ensure that a PR is handled promptly, it should contain your (unique)
\fIsubmitter-id\fR and one of the available \fIcategories\fR to identify the
problem area.  (Use
.B `cvsbug -L'
to see a list of categories.)
.LP
The
.B cvsbug
template at your site should already be customized with your
submitter-id (running `\|\fBinstall-sid\fP \fIsubmitter-id\fP\|' to
accomplish this is part of the installation procedures for
.BR cvsbug ).
If this hasn't been done, see your system administrator for your
submitter-id, or request one from your support site by invoking
.B `cvsbug \-\-request\-id'.
If your site does not distinguish between different user sites, or if
you are not affiliated with the support site, use
.B `net'
for this field.
.LP
The more precise your problem description and the more complete your
information, the faster your support team can solve your problems.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI \-f " problem-report"
specify a file (\fIproblem-report\fR) which already contains a
complete problem report.
.B cvsbug
sends the contents of the file without invoking the editor.  If 
the value for 
.I problem-report
is
.BR `\|\-\|' ,
then
.B cvsbug
reads from standard input.
.TP
.BI \-t " mail-address"
Change mail address at the support site for problem reports.  The
default 
.I mail-address
is the address used for the default 
.IR site .  
Use the
.I site
argument rather than this option in nearly all cases.
.TP
.B \-P
print the form specified by the environment variable 
.B PR_FORM 
on standard output.  If 
.B PR_FORM
is not set, print the standard blank PR template.  No mail is sent.
.TP
.B -L
print the list of available categories.  No mail is sent.
.TP
.B \-\-request\-id
sends mail to the default support site, or
.I site
if specified, with a request for your 
.IR submitter-id . 
If you are
not affiliated with 
.IR site ,
use a
.I submitter-id
of
.BR net \|'.
.TP
.B \-v
Display the 
.B cvsbug
version number.
.LP
Note: use
.B cvsbug
to submit problem reports rather than mailing them directly.  Using
both the template and
.B cvsbug
itself will help ensure all necessary information will reach the
support site.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
The environment variable 
.B EDITOR
specifies the editor to invoke on the template.
.br
default:
.B vi
.sp
If the environment variable 
.B PR_FORM
is set, then its value is used as the file name of the template for
your problem-report editing session.  You can use this to start with a
partially completed form (for example, a form with the identification
fields already completed).
.SH "HOW TO FILL OUT A PROBLEM REPORT"
Problem reports have to be in a particular form so that a program can
easily manage them.  Please remember the following guidelines:
.IP \(bu 3m 
describe only 
.B one problem
with each problem report.
.IP \(bu 3m
For follow-up mail, use the same subject line as the one in the automatic
acknowledgent. It consists of category, PR number and the original synopsis
line.  This allows the support site to relate several mail messages to a
particular PR and to record them automatically.
.IP \(bu 3m 
Please try to be as accurate as possible in the subject and/or synopsis line.
.IP \(bu 3m 
The subject and the synopsis line are not confidential.  This is
because open-bugs lists are compiled from them.  Avoid confidential
information there.
.LP
See the GNU 
.B Info 
file
.B cvsbug.info
or the document \fIReporting Problems With cvsbug\fR\ for detailed
information on reporting problems
.SH "HOW TO SUBMIT TEST CASES, CODE, ETC."
Submit small code samples with the PR.  Contact the support site for
instructions on submitting larger test cases and problematic source
code.
.SH FILES
.ta \w'/tmp/pbad$$  'u
/tmp/p$$	copy of PR used in editing session
.br
/tmp/pf$$	copy of empty PR form, for testing purposes
.br
/tmp/pbad$$	file for rejected PRs
.SH EMACS USER INTERFACE
An Emacs user interface for 
.B cvsbug
with completion of field values is part of the 
.B cvsbug
distribution (invoked with
.BR "M-x cvsbug" ).
See the file
.B cvsbug.info
or the ASCII file
.B INSTALL
in the top level directory of the distribution for configuration and
installation information.  The Emacs LISP template file is 
.B cvsbug-el.in
and is installed as
.BR cvsbug.el .
.SH INSTALLATION AND CONFIGURATION
See 
.B cvsbug.info
or
.B INSTALL
for installation instructions.
.SH SEE ALSO
.I Reporting Problems Using cvsbug
(also installed as the GNU Info file
.BR cvsbug.info ).
