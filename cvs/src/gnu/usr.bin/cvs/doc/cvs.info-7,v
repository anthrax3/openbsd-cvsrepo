Reference manual for Administrative files
*****************************************

   Inside the repository, in the directory `$CVSROOT/CVSROOT', there
are a number of supportive files for CVS.  You can use CVS in a limited
fashion without any of them, but if they are set up properly they can
help make life easier.  For a discussion of how to edit them, see *Note
Intro administrative files::.

   The most important of these files is the `modules' file, which
defines the modules inside the repository.

The modules file
================

   The `modules' file records your definitions of names for collections
of source code.  CVS will use these definitions if you use CVS to
update the modules file (use normal commands like `add', `commit', etc).

   The `modules' file may contain blank lines and comments (lines
beginning with `#') as well as module definitions.  Long lines can be
continued on the next line by specifying a backslash (`\') as the last
character on the line.

   There are three basic types of modules: alias modules, regular
modules, and ampersand modules.  The difference between them is the way
that they map files in the repository to files in the working
directory.  In all of the following examples, the top-level repository
contains a directory called `first-dir', which contains two files,
`file1' and `file2', and a directory `sdir'.  `first-dir/sdir' contains
a file `sfile'.

* Module options::            Regular and ampersand modules can take options

File: cvs.info,  Node: Alias modules,  Next: Regular modules,  Up: modules

Alias modules
-------------

   Alias modules are the simplest kind of module:

`MNAME -a ALIASES...'
     This represents the simplest way of defining a module MNAME.  The
     `-a' flags the definition as a simple alias: CVS will treat any
     use of MNAME (as a command argument) as if the list of names
     ALIASES had been specified instead.  ALIASES may contain either
     other module names or paths.  When you use paths in aliases,
     `checkout' creates all intermediate directories in the working
     directory, just as if the path had been specified explicitly in
     the CVS arguments.

   For example, if the modules file contains:

     amodule -a first-dir

then the following two commands are equivalent:

     $ cvs co amodule
     $ cvs co first-dir

and they each would provide output such as:

     cvs checkout: Updating first-dir
     U first-dir/file1
     U first-dir/file2
     cvs checkout: Updating first-dir/sdir
     U first-dir/sdir/sfile


File: cvs.info,  Node: Regular modules,  Next: Ampersand modules,  Prev: Alias modules,  Up: modules

Regular modules
---------------

`MNAME [ options ] DIR [ FILES... ]'
     In the simplest case, this form of module definition reduces to
     `MNAME DIR'.  This defines all the files in directory DIR as
     module mname.  DIR is a relative path (from `$CVSROOT') to a
     directory of source in the source repository.  In this case, on
     checkout, a single directory called MNAME is created as a working
     directory; no intermediate directory levels are used by default,
     even if DIR was a path involving several directory levels.

   For example, if a module is defined by:

     regmodule first-dir

then regmodule will contain the files from first-dir:

     $ cvs co regmodule
     cvs checkout: Updating regmodule
     U regmodule/file1
     U regmodule/file2
     cvs checkout: Updating regmodule/sdir
     U regmodule/sdir/sfile
     $

   By explicitly specifying files in the module definition after DIR,
you can select particular files from directory DIR.  Here is an example:

     regfiles first-dir/sdir sfile

With this definition, getting the regfiles module will create a single
working directory `regfiles' containing the file listed, which comes
from a directory deeper in the CVS source repository:

     $ cvs co regfiles
     U regfiles/sfile
     $


File: cvs.info,  Node: Ampersand modules,  Next: Excluding directories,  Prev: Regular modules,  Up: modules

Ampersand modules
-----------------

   A module definition can refer to other modules by including
`&MODULE' in its definition.
     MNAME [ options ] &MODULE...

   Then getting the module creates a subdirectory for each such module,
in the directory containing the module.  For example, if modules
contains

     ampermod &first-dir

   then a checkout will create an `ampermod' directory which contains a
directory called `first-dir', which in turns contains all the
directories and files which live there.  For example, the command

     $ cvs co ampermod

will create the following files:

     ampermod/first-dir/file1
     ampermod/first-dir/file2
     ampermod/first-dir/sdir/sfile

   There is one quirk/bug: the messages that CVS prints omit the
`ampermod', and thus do not correctly display the location to which it
is checking out the files:

     $ cvs co ampermod
     cvs checkout: Updating first-dir
     U first-dir/file1
     U first-dir/file2
     cvs checkout: Updating first-dir/sdir
     U first-dir/sdir/sfile
     $

   Do not rely on this buggy behavior; it may get fixed in a future
release of CVS.


File: cvs.info,  Node: Excluding directories,  Next: Module options,  Prev: Ampersand modules,  Up: modules

Excluding directories
---------------------

   An alias module may exclude particular directories from other
modules by using an exclamation mark (`!') before the name of each
directory to be excluded.

   For example, if the modules file contains:

     exmodule -a !first-dir/sdir first-dir

   then checking out the module `exmodule' will check out everything in
`first-dir' except any files in the subdirectory `first-dir/sdir'.


File: cvs.info,  Node: Module options,  Next: Module program options,  Prev: Excluding directories,  Up: modules

Module options
--------------

   Either regular modules or ampersand modules can contain options,
which supply additional information concerning the module.

`-d NAME'
     Name the working directory something other than the module name.

`-e PROG'
     Specify a program PROG to run whenever files in a module are
     exported.  PROG runs with a single argument, the module name.

`-i PROG'
     Specify a program PROG to run whenever files in a module are
     committed.  PROG runs with a single argument, the full pathname of
     the affected directory in a source repository.  The `commitinfo',
     `loginfo', and `verifymsg' files provide other ways to call a
     program on commit.

`-o PROG'
     Specify a program PROG to run whenever files in a module are
     checked out.  PROG runs with a single argument, the module name.

`-s STATUS'
     Assign a status to the module.  When the module file is printed
     with `cvs checkout -s' the modules are sorted according to
     primarily module status, and secondarily according to the module
     name.  This option has no other meaning.  You can use this option
     for several things besides status: for instance, list the person
     that is responsible for this module.

`-t PROG'
     Specify a program PROG to run whenever files in a module are
     tagged with `rtag'.  PROG runs with two arguments: the module name
     and the symbolic tag specified to `rtag'.  It is not run when
     `tag' is executed.  Generally you will find that taginfo is a
     better solution (*note user-defined logging::).

`-u PROG'
     Specify a program PROG to run whenever `cvs update' is executed
     from the top-level directory of the checked-out module.  PROG runs
     with a single argument, the full path to the source repository for
     this module.

   You should also see *note Module program options:: about how the
"program options" programs are run.


File: cvs.info,  Node: Module program options,  Prev: Module options,  Up: modules

How the modules file "program options" programs are run
-------------------------------------------------------

For checkout, rtag, and export, the program is server-based, and as
such the following applies:-

   If using remote access methods (pserver, ext, etc.), CVS will
execute this program on the server from a temporary directory. The path
is searched for this program.

   If using "local access" (on a local or remote NFS filesystem, i.e.
repository set just to a path), the program will be executed from the
newly checked-out tree, if found there, or alternatively searched for
in the path if not.

The commit and update programs are locally-based, and are run as
follows:-

   The program is always run locally. One must re-checkout the tree one
is using if these options are updated in the modules administrative
file. The file CVS/Checkin.prog contains the value of the option `-i'
set in the modules file, and similarly for the file CVS/Update.prog and
`-u'. The program is always executed from the top level of the
checked-out copy on the client. Again, the program is first searched
for in the checked-out copy and then using the path.

   The programs are all run after the operation has effectively
completed.

The cvswrappers file
====================

   Wrappers refers to a CVS feature which lets you control certain
settings based on the name of the file which is being operated on.  The
settings are `-k' for binary files, and `-m' for nonmergeable text
files.

   The `-m' option specifies the merge methodology that should be used
when a non-binary file is updated.  `MERGE' means the usual CVS
behavior: try to merge the files.  `COPY' means that `cvs update' will
refuse to merge files, as it also does for files specified as binary
with `-kb' (but if the file is specified as binary, there is no need to
specify `-m 'COPY'').  CVS will provide the user with the two versions
of the files, and require the user using mechanisms outside CVS, to
insert any necessary changes.  *WARNING*: do not use `COPY' with CVS
1.9 or earlier-such versions of CVS will copy one version of your file
over the other, wiping out the previous contents.  The `-m' wrapper
option only affects behavior when merging is done on update; it does
not affect how files are stored.  See *Note Binary files::, for more on
binary files.

   The basic format of the file `cvswrappers' is:

     wildcard     [option value][option value]...
     
     where option is one of
     -m           update methodology      value: MERGE or COPY
     -k           keyword expansion       value: expansion mode
     
     and value is a single-quote delimited value.

   For example, the following command imports a directory, treating
files whose name ends in `.exe' as binary:

     cvs import -I ! -W "*.exe -k 'b'" first-dir vendortag reltag

The commit support files
========================

   The `-i' flag in the `modules' file can be used to run a certain
program whenever files are committed (*note modules::).  The files
described in this section provide other, more flexible, ways to run
programs whenever something is committed.

   There are three kind of programs that can be run on commit.  They
are specified in files in the repository, as described below.  The
following table summarizes the file names and the purpose of the
corresponding programs.

`commitinfo'
     The program is responsible for checking that the commit is
     allowed.  If it exits with a non-zero exit status the commit will
     be aborted.

`verifymsg'
     The specified program is used to evaluate the log message, and
     possibly verify that it contains all required fields.  This is
     most useful in combination with the `rcsinfo' file, which can hold
     a log message template (*note rcsinfo::).

`editinfo'
     The specified program is used to edit the log message, and
     possibly verify that it contains all required fields.  This is
     most useful in combination with the `rcsinfo' file, which can hold
     a log message template (*note rcsinfo::).  (obsolete)

`loginfo'
     The specified program is called when the commit is complete.  It
     receives the log message and some additional information and can
     store the log message in a file, or mail it to appropriate
     persons, or maybe post it to a local newsgroup, or...  Your
     imagination is the limit!

File: cvs.info,  Node: syntax,  Up: commit files

The common syntax
-----------------

   The administrative files such as `commitinfo', `loginfo', `rcsinfo',
`verifymsg', etc., all have a common format.  The purpose of the files
are described later on.  The common syntax is described here.

   Each line contains the following:
   * A regular expression.  This is a basic regular expression in the
     syntax used by GNU emacs.

   * A whitespace separator--one or more spaces and/or tabs.

   * A file name or command-line template.

Blank lines are ignored.  Lines that start with the character `#' are
treated as comments.  Long lines unfortunately can _not_ be broken in
two parts in any way.

   The first regular expression that matches the current directory name
in the repository is used.  The rest of the line is used as a file name
or command-line as appropriate.


File: cvs.info,  Node: commitinfo,  Next: verifymsg,  Prev: commit files,  Up: Administrative files

Commitinfo
==========

   The `commitinfo' file defines programs to execute whenever `cvs
commit' is about to execute.  These programs are used for pre-commit
checking to verify that the modified, added and removed files are really
ready to be committed.  This could be used, for instance, to verify
that the changed files conform to to your site's standards for coding
practice.

   As mentioned earlier, each line in the `commitinfo' file consists of
a regular expression and a command-line template.  The template can
include a program name and any number of arguments you wish to supply
to it.  The full path to the current source repository is appended to
the template, followed by the file names of any files involved in the
commit (added, removed, and modified files).

   The first line with a regular expression matching the directory
within the repository will be used.  If the command returns a non-zero
exit status the commit will be aborted.

   If the repository name does not match any of the regular expressions
in this file, the `DEFAULT' line is used, if it is specified.

   All occurrences of the name `ALL' appearing as a regular expression
are used in addition to the first matching regular expression or the
name `DEFAULT'.

   Note: when CVS is accessing a remote repository, `commitinfo' will
be run on the _remote_ (i.e., server) side, not the client side (*note
Remote repositories::).

Verifying log messages
======================

   Once you have entered a log message, you can evaluate that message
to check for specific content, such as a bug ID.  Use the `verifymsg'
file to specify a program that is used to verify the log message.  This
program could be a simple script that checks that the entered message
contains the required fields.

   The `verifymsg' file is often most useful together with the
`rcsinfo' file, which can be used to specify a log message template.

   Each line in the `verifymsg' file consists of a regular expression
and a command-line template.  The template must include a program name,
and can include any number of arguments.  The full path to the current
log message template file is appended to the template.

   One thing that should be noted is that the `ALL' keyword is not
supported.  If more than one matching line is found, the first one is
used.  This can be useful for specifying a default verification script
in a directory, and then overriding it in a subdirectory.

   If the repository name does not match any of the regular expressions
in this file, the `DEFAULT' line is used, if it is specified.

   If the verification script exits with a non-zero exit status, the
commit is aborted.

   Note that the verification script cannot change the log message; it
can merely accept it or reject it.

   The following is a little silly example of a `verifymsg' file,
together with the corresponding `rcsinfo' file, the log message
template and an verification  script.  We begin with the log message
template.  We want to always record a bug-id number on the first line
of the log message.  The rest of log message is free text.  The
following template is found in the file `/usr/cvssupport/tc.template'.

     BugId:

   The script `/usr/cvssupport/bugid.verify' is used to evaluate the
log message.

     #!/bin/sh
     #
     #       bugid.verify filename
     #
     #  Verify that the log message contains a valid bugid
     #  on the first line.
     #
     if head -1 < $1 | grep '^BugId:[ ]*[0-9][0-9]*$' > /dev/null; then
         exit 0
     else
         echo "No BugId found."
         exit 1
     fi

   The `verifymsg' file contains this line:

     ^tc     /usr/cvssupport/bugid.verify

   The `rcsinfo' file contains this line:

     ^tc     /usr/cvssupport/tc.template


File: cvs.info,  Node: editinfo,  Next: loginfo,  Prev: verifymsg,  Up: Administrative files

Editinfo
========

   _NOTE:_ The `editinfo' feature has been rendered obsolete.  To set a
default editor for log messages use the `EDITOR' environment variable
(*note Environment variables::) or the `-e' global option (*note Global
options::).  See *Note verifymsg::, for information on the use of the
`verifymsg' feature for evaluating log messages.

   If you want to make sure that all log messages look the same way,
you can use the `editinfo' file to specify a program that is used to
edit the log message.  This program could be a custom-made editor that
always enforces a certain style of the log message, or maybe a simple
shell script that calls an editor, and checks that the entered message
contains the required fields.

   If no matching line is found in the `editinfo' file, the editor
specified in the environment variable `$CVSEDITOR' is used instead.  If
that variable is not set, then the environment variable `$EDITOR' is
used instead.  If that variable is not set a default will be used.  See
*Note Committing your changes::.

   The `editinfo' file is often most useful together with the `rcsinfo'
file, which can be used to specify a log message template.

   Each line in the `editinfo' file consists of a regular expression
and a command-line template.  The template must include a program name,
and can include any number of arguments.  The full path to the current
log message template file is appended to the template.

   One thing that should be noted is that the `ALL' keyword is not
supported.  If more than one matching line is found, the first one is
used.  This can be useful for specifying a default edit script in a
module, and then overriding it in a subdirectory.

   If the repository name does not match any of the regular expressions
in this file, the `DEFAULT' line is used, if it is specified.

   If the edit script exits with a non-zero exit status, the commit is
aborted.

   Note: when CVS is accessing a remote repository, or when the `-m' or
`-F' options to `cvs commit' are used, `editinfo' will not be consulted.
There is no good workaround for this; use `verifymsg' instead.

Editinfo example
----------------

   The following is a little silly example of a `editinfo' file,
together with the corresponding `rcsinfo' file, the log message
template and an editor script.  We begin with the log message template.
We want to always record a bug-id number on the first line of the log
message.  The rest of log message is free text.  The following template
is found in the file `/usr/cvssupport/tc.template'.

     BugId:

   The script `/usr/cvssupport/bugid.edit' is used to edit the log
message.

     #!/bin/sh
     #
     #       bugid.edit filename
     #
     #  Call $EDITOR on FILENAME, and verify that the
     #  resulting file contains a valid bugid on the first
     #  line.
     if [ "x$EDITOR" = "x" ]; then EDITOR=vi; fi
     if [ "x$CVSEDITOR" = "x" ]; then CVSEDITOR=$EDITOR; fi
     $CVSEDITOR $1
     until head -1|grep '^BugId:[ ]*[0-9][0-9]*$' < $1
     do  echo -n  "No BugId found.  Edit again? ([y]/n)"
         read ans
         case ${ans} in
             n*) exit 1;;
         esac
         $CVSEDITOR $1
     done

   The `editinfo' file contains this line:

     ^tc     /usr/cvssupport/bugid.edit

   The `rcsinfo' file contains this line:

     ^tc     /usr/cvssupport/tc.template


File: cvs.info,  Node: loginfo,  Next: rcsinfo,  Prev: editinfo,  Up: Administrative files

Loginfo
=======

   The `loginfo' file is used to control where `cvs commit' log
information is sent.  The first entry on a line is a regular expression
which is tested against the directory that the change is being made to,
relative to the `$CVSROOT'.  If a match is found, then the remainder of
the line is a filter program that should expect log information on its
standard input.

   If the repository name does not match any of the regular expressions
in this file, the `DEFAULT' line is used, if it is specified.

   All occurrences of the name `ALL' appearing as a regular expression
are used in addition to the first matching regular expression or
`DEFAULT'.

   The first matching regular expression is used.

   *Note commit files::, for a description of the syntax of the
`loginfo' file.

   The user may specify a format string as part of the filter.  The
string is composed of a `%' followed by a space, or followed by a single
format character, or followed by a set of format characters surrounded
by `{' and `}' as separators.  The format characters are:

s
     file name

V
     old version number (pre-checkin)

v
     new version number (post-checkin)

   All other characters that appear in a format string expand to an
empty field (commas separating fields are still provided).

   For example, some valid format strings are `%', `%s', `%{s}', and
`%{sVv}'.

   The output will be a string of tokens separated by spaces.  For
backwards compatibility, the first token will be the repository
subdirectory.  The rest of the tokens will be comma-delimited lists of
the information requested in the format string.  For example, if
`/u/src/master/yoyodyne/tc' is the repository, `%{sVv}' is the format
string, and three files (ChangeLog, Makefile, foo.c) were modified, the
output might be:

     yoyodyne/tc ChangeLog,1.1,1.2 Makefile,1.3,1.4 foo.c,1.12,1.13

   As another example, `%{}' means that only the name of the repository
will be generated.

   Note: when CVS is accessing a remote repository, `loginfo' will be
run on the _remote_ (i.e., server) side, not the client side (*note
Remote repositories::).

File: cvs.info,  Node: loginfo example,  Next: Keeping a checked out copy,  Up: loginfo

Loginfo example
---------------

   The following `loginfo' file, together with the tiny shell-script
below, appends all log messages to the file
`$CVSROOT/CVSROOT/commitlog', and any commits to the administrative
files (inside the `CVSROOT' directory) are also logged in
`/usr/adm/cvsroot-log'.  Commits to the `prog1' directory are mailed to
ceder.

     ALL             /usr/local/bin/cvs-log $CVSROOT/CVSROOT/commitlog $USER
     ^CVSROOT        /usr/local/bin/cvs-log /usr/adm/cvsroot-log
     ^prog1          Mail -s %s ceder

   The shell-script `/usr/local/bin/cvs-log' looks like this:

     #!/bin/sh
     (echo "------------------------------------------------------";
      echo -n $2"  ";
      date;
      echo;
      cat) >> $1


File: cvs.info,  Node: Keeping a checked out copy,  Prev: loginfo example,  Up: loginfo

Keeping a checked out copy
--------------------------

   It is often useful to maintain a directory tree which contains files
which correspond to the latest version in the repository.  For example,
other developers might want to refer to the latest sources without
having to check them out, or you might be maintaining a web site with
CVS and want every checkin to cause the files used by the web server to
be updated.

   The way to do this is by having loginfo invoke `cvs update'.  Doing
so in the naive way will cause a problem with locks, so the `cvs update'
must be run in the background.  Here is an example for unix (this
should all be on one line):

     ^cyclic-pages		(date; cat; (sleep 2; cd /u/www/local-docs;
      cvs -q update -d) &) >> $CVSROOT/CVSROOT/updatelog 2>&1

   This will cause checkins to repository directories starting with
`cyclic-pages' to update the checked out tree in `/u/www/local-docs'.


File: cvs.info,  Node: rcsinfo,  Next: cvsignore,  Prev: loginfo,  Up: Administrative files

Rcsinfo
=======

   The `rcsinfo' file can be used to specify a form to edit when
filling out the commit log.  The `rcsinfo' file has a syntax similar to
the `verifymsg', `commitinfo' and `loginfo' files.  *Note syntax::.
Unlike the other files the second part is _not_ a command-line
template.  Instead, the part after the regular expression should be a
full pathname to a file containing the log message template.

   If the repository name does not match any of the regular expressions
in this file, the `DEFAULT' line is used, if it is specified.

   All occurrences of the name `ALL' appearing as a regular expression
are used in addition to the first matching regular expression or
`DEFAULT'.

   The log message template will be used as a default log message.  If
you specify a log message with `cvs commit -m MESSAGE' or `cvs commit -f
FILE' that log message will override the template.

   *Note verifymsg::, for an example `rcsinfo' file.

   When CVS is accessing a remote repository, the contents of `rcsinfo'
at the time a directory is first checked out will specify a template
which does not then change.  If you edit `rcsinfo' or its templates,
you may need to check out a new working directory.

Preamble
d1264 84
a1347 293
   The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in
new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

   For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

   We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software,
and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

   Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

   Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
     notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
     under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program",
     below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on
     the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work under
     copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a
     portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
     translated into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
     included without limitation in the term "modification".)  Each
     licensee is addressed as "you".

     Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are
     not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act
     of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the
     Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on
     the Program (independent of having been made by running the
     Program).  Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
     source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
     conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
     copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
     notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
     warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of
     this License along with the Program.

     You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
     and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange
     for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
     of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
     distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
     above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

       a. You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

       b. You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that
          in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program
          or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge
          to all third parties under the terms of this License.

       c. If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
          when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
          interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display
          an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and
          a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you
          provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the
          program under these conditions, and telling the user how to
          view a copy of this License.  (Exception: if the Program
          itself is interactive but does not normally print such an
          announcement, your work based on the Program is not required
          to print an announcement.)

     These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
     identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the
     Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate
     works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not
     apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate
     works.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a
     whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of
     the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions
     for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each
     and every part regardless of who wrote it.

     Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or
     contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the
     intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of
     derivative or collective works based on the Program.

     In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the
     Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on
     a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the
     other work under the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
     under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms
     of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the
     following:

       a. Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
          source code, which must be distributed under the terms of
          Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for
          software interchange; or,

       b. Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
          years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
          cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
          machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
          distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
          medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

       c. Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
          to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
          allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
          received the program in object code or executable form with
          such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

     The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
     making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete
     source code means all the source code for all modules it contains,
     plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts
     used to control compilation and installation of the executable.
     However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need
     not include anything that is normally distributed (in either
     source or binary form) with the major components (compiler,
     kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable
     runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.

     If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
     access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
     access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
     distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
     compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
     void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
     License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
     from you under this License will not have their licenses
     terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
     signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify
     or distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions
     are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.
     Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work
     based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this
     License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
     distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
     Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
     original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program
     subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any
     further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights
     granted herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance
     by third parties to this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
     infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent
     issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order,
     agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this
     License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this
     License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously
     your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
     obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the
     Program at all.  For example, if a patent license would not permit
     royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
     receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only
     way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain
     entirely from distribution of the Program.

     If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable
     under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is
     intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply
     in other circumstances.

     It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
     patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of
     any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting
     the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
     implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
     generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
     through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
     system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is
     willing to distribute software through any other system and a
     licensee cannot impose that choice.

     This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed
     to be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
     certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,
     the original copyright holder who places the Program under this
     License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation
     excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only
     in or among countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this
     License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of
     this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
     versions of the General Public License from time to time.  Such
     new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but
     may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

     Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
     Program specifies a version number of this License which applies
     to it and "any later version", you have the option of following
     the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later
     version published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Program
     does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose
     any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

 10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
     programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
     author to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted
     by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software
     Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our decision
     will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of
     all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
     and reuse of software generally.

                                NO WARRANTY

 11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
     WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
     LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
     HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT
     WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT
     NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND
     FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE
     QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
     PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY
     SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

 12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
     WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY
     MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE
     LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,
     INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR
     INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
     DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU
     OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY
     OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN
     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

                      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
=============================================

   If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
terms.

   To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

     ONE LINE TO GIVE THE PROGRAM'S NAME AND A BRIEF IDEA OF WHAT IT DOES.
     Copyright (C) 19YY  NAME OF AUTHOR
     
     This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
     it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
     the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
     (at your option) any later version.
     
     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
     GNU General Public License for more details.
     
     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
     along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
     Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place - Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307, USA.

   Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper
mail.

   If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like
this when it starts in an interactive mode:

     Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19YY NAME OF AUTHOR
     Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details
     type `show w'.
     This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
     under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

   The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the
commands you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show
c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your
program.

   You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or
your school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program,
if necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
d1351 1

   This General Public License does not permit incorporating your
program into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine
library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary
applications with the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the
GNU Library General Public License instead of this License.

All environment variables which affect CVS
******************************************

   This is a complete list of all environment variables that affect CVS.

`$CVSIGNORE'
     A whitespace-separated list of file name patterns that CVS should
     ignore. *Note cvsignore::.

`$CVSWRAPPERS'
     A whitespace-separated list of file name patterns that CVS should
     treat as wrappers. *Note Wrappers::.

`$CVSREAD'
     If this is set, `checkout' and `update' will try hard to make the
     files in your working directory read-only.  When this is not set,
     the default behavior is to permit modification of your working
     files.

`$CVSROOT'
     Should contain the full pathname to the root of the CVS source
     repository (where the RCS history files are kept).  This
     information must be available to CVS for most commands to execute;
     if `$CVSROOT' is not set, or if you wish to override it for one
     invocation, you can supply it on the command line: `cvs -d cvsroot
     cvs_command...' Once you have checked out a working directory, CVS
     stores the appropriate root (in the file `CVS/Root'), so normally
     you only need to worry about this when initially checking out a
     working directory.

`$EDITOR'
`$CVSEDITOR'
     Specifies the program to use for recording log messages during
     commit.  If not set, the default is `/usr/ucb/vi'.  `$CVSEDITOR'
     overrides `$EDITOR'.

`$PATH'
     If `$RCSBIN' is not set, and no path is compiled into CVS, it will
     use `$PATH' to try to find all programs it uses.

`$RCSBIN'
     This is the value CVS is using for where to find RCS binaries.
     *Note Global options::, for a description of how to specify this.
     If not set, a compiled-in value is used, or your `$PATH' is
     searched.

`$HOME'
`$HOMEPATH'
     Used to locate the directory where the `.cvsrc' file is searched
     (`$HOMEPATH' is used for Windows-NT).  *note ~/.cvsrc::.

`$CVS_RSH'
     Specifies the external program which CVS connects with, when
     `:ext:' access method is specified.  *note Connecting via rsh::..

`$CVS_SERVER'
     Used in client-server mode when accessing a remote repository
     using RSH.  It specifies the name of the program to start on the
     server side when accessing a remote repository using RSH.  The
     default value is `cvs'.  *note Connecting via rsh::.

`$CVS_PASSFILE'
     Used in client-server mode when accessing the `cvs login server'.
     Default value is `$HOME/.cvspass'.  *note Password authentication
     client::.

`$CVS_CLIENT_PORT'
     Used in client-server mode when accessing the server via Kerberos.
     *note Kerberos authenticated::.

`$CVS_RCMD_PORT'
     Used in client-server mode.  If set, specifies the port number to
     be used when accessing the RCMD demon on the server side.
     (Currently not used for Unix clients).

`$CVS_CLIENT_LOG'
     Used for debugging only in client-server mode.  If set, everything
     send to the server is logged into ``$CVS_CLIENT_LOG'.in' and
     everything send from the server is logged into
     ``$CVS_CLIENT_LOG'.out'.

`$CVS_SERVER_SLEEP'
     Used only for debugging the server side in client-server mode.  If
     set, delays the start of the server child process the the
     specified amount of seconds so that you can attach to it with a
     debugger.

`$CVS_IGNORE_REMOTE_ROOT'
     (What is the purpose of this variable?)

`$COMSPEC'
     Used under OS/2 only.  It specifies the name of the command
     interpreter and defaults to CMD.EXE.

`$TMPDIR'
`$TMP'
`$TEMP'
     Directory in which temporary files are located.  Those parts of
     CVS which are implemented using RCS inspect the above variables in
     the order they appear above and the first value found is taken; if
     none of them are set, a host-dependent default is used, typically
     `/tmp'.  The CVS server uses `TMPDIR'.  *Note Global options::,
     for a description of how to specify this.  Some parts of CVS will
     always use `/tmp' (via the `tmpnam' function provided by the
     system).

     On Windows NT, `TMP' is used (via the `_tempnam' function provided
     by the system).

     The `patch' program which is used by the CVS client uses `TMPDIR',
     and if it is not set, uses `/tmp' (at least with GNU patch 2.1).

   CVS invokes RCS to perform certain operations.  The following
environment variables affect RCS.  Note that if you are using the
client/server CVS, these variables need to be set on the server side
(which may or not may be possible depending on how you are connecting).
There is probably not any need to set any of them, however.

`$LOGNAME'
`$USER'
     If set, they affect who RCS thinks you are.  If you have trouble
     checking in files it might be because your login name differs from
     the setting of e.g.  `$LOGNAME'.

`$RCSINIT'
     Options prepended to the argument list, separated by spaces.  A
     backslash escapes spaces within an option.  The `$RCSINIT' options
     are prepended to the argument lists of most RCS commands.

Magic branch numbers
====================

   Externally, branch numbers consist of an odd number of dot-separated
decimal integers.  *Note Revision numbers::.  That is not the whole
truth, however.  For efficiency reasons CVS sometimes inserts an extra 0
in the second rightmost position (1.2.3 becomes 1.2.0.3, 8.9.10.11.12
becomes 8.9.10.11.0.12 and so on).

   CVS does a pretty good job at hiding these so called magic branches,
but in a few places the hiding is incomplete:

   * The magic branch number appears in the output from `cvs log'.

   * You cannot specify a symbolic branch name to `cvs admin'.

   You can use the `admin' command to reassign a symbolic name to a
branch the way RCS expects it to be.  If `R4patches' is assigned to the
branch 1.4.2 (magic branch number 1.4.0.2) in file `numbers.c' you can
do this:

     $ cvs admin -NR4patches:1.4.2 numbers.c

   It only works if at least one revision is already committed on the
branch.  Be very careful so that you do not assign the tag to the wrong
number.  (There is no way to see how the tag was assigned yesterday).

Partial list of error messages
==============================
d172 23
a194 99
   Here is a partial list of error messages that you may see from CVS.
It is not a complete list--CVS is capable of printing many, many error
messages, often with parts of them supplied by the operating system,
but the intention is to list the common and/or potentially confusing
error messages.

   The messages are alphabetical, but introductory text such as `cvs
update: ' is not considered in ordering them.

   In some cases the list includes messages printed by old versions of
CVS (partly because users may not be sure which version of CVS they are
using at any particular moment).

`cvs [server aborted]: received broken pipe signal'
     This message seems to be caused by a hard-to-track-down bug in CVS
     or the systems it runs on (we don't know--we haven't tracked it
     down yet!).  It seems to happen only after a CVS command has
     completed, and you should be able to just ignore the message.
     However, if you have discovered information concerning its cause,
     please let us know as described in *Note BUGS::.

`cannot open CVS/Entries for reading: No such file or directory'
     This generally indicates a CVS internal error, and can be handled
     as with other CVS bugs (*note BUGS::.).  Usually there is a
     workaround--the exact nature of which would depend on the
     situation but which hopefully could be figured out.

`cvs [update aborted]: could not patch FILE: No such file or directory'
     This means that there was a problem finding the `patch' program.
     Make sure that it is in your `PATH'.  Note that despite
     appearances the message is *not* referring to whether it can find
     FILE.

`cvs update: could not patch FILE; will refetch'
     This means that for whatever reason the client was unable to apply
     a patch that the server sent.  The message is nothing to be
     concerned about, because inability to apply the patch only slows
     things down and has no effect on what CVS does.

`dying gasps from SERVER unexpected'
     This message seems to be caused by a hard-to-track-down bug in CVS
     or the systems it runs on (we don't know--we haven't tracked it
     down yet!).  If you see it, you probably can just retry the
     operation which failed, or if you have discovered information
     concerning its cause, please let us know as described in *Note
     BUGS::.

`end of file from server (consult above messages if any)'
     The most common cause for this message is if you are using an
     external `rsh' program and it exited with an error.  In this case
     the `rsh' program should have printed a message, which will appear
     before the above message.  For more information on setting up a
     CVS client and server, see *Note Remote repositories::.

`cvs commit: Executing 'mkmodules''
     This means that your repository is set up for a version of CVS
     prior to CVS 1.8.  When using CVS 1.8 or later, the above message
     will be preceded by

          cvs commit: Rebuilding administrative file database

     If you see both messages, the database is being rebuilt twice,
     which is unnecessary but harmless.  If you wish to avoid the
     duplication, and you have no versions of CVS 1.7 or earlier in
     use, remove `-i mkmodules' every place it appears in your `modules'
     file.  For more information on the `modules' file, see *Note
     modules::.

`cvs commit: Up-to-date check failed for `FILE''
     This means that someone else has committed a change to that file
     since the last time that you did a `cvs update'.  So before
     proceeding with your `cvs commit' you need to `cvs update'.  CVS
     will merge the changes that you made and the changes that the
     other person made.  If it does not detect any conflicts it will
     report `M cacErrCodes.h' and you are ready to `cvs commit'.  If it
     detects conflicts it will print a message saying so, will report
     `C cacErrCodes.h', and you need to manually resolve the conflict.
     For more details on this process see *Note Conflicts example::.

`Usage:	diff3 [-exEX3 [-i | -m] [-L label1 -L label3]] file1 file2 file3'
          Only one of [exEX3] allowed
     This indicates a problem with the installation of `diff3' and
     `rcsmerge'.  Specifically `rcsmerge' was compiled to look for GNU
     diff3, but it is finding unix diff3 instead.  The exact text of
     the message will vary depending on the system.  The solution is to
     make sure `rcsmerge' finds GNU diff3.  Depending on how `rcsmerge'
     was compiled, it might be sufficient to place GNU diff3 in your
     `PATH', or it might be necessary to recompile `rcsmerge' or find a
     binary distribution of `rcsmerge' which looks in the `PATH'.

`cvs commit: warning: editor session failed'
     This means that the editor which CVS is using exits with a nonzero
     exit status.  Some versions of vi will do this even when there was
     not a problem editing the file.  If so, point the CVSEDITOR
     environment variable to a small script such as:

          #!/bin/sh
          vi $*
          exit 0

File: cvs.info,  Node: cvsignore,  Next: history file,  Prev: rcsinfo,  Up: Administrative files

Ignoring files via cvsignore
============================

   There are certain file names that frequently occur inside your
working copy, but that you don't want to put under CVS control.
Examples are all the object files that you get while you compile your
sources.  Normally, when you run `cvs update', it prints a line for
each file it encounters that it doesn't know about (*note update
output::.).

   CVS has a list of files (or sh(1) file name patterns) that it should
ignore while running `update', `import' and `release'.  This list is
constructed in the following way.

   * The list is initialized to include certain file name patterns:
     names associated with CVS administration, or with other common
     source control systems; common names for patch files, object files,
     archive files, and editor backup files; and other names that are
     usually artifacts of assorted utilities.  Currently, the default
     list of ignored file name patterns is:

              RCS     SCCS    CVS     CVS.adm
              RCSLOG  cvslog.*
              tags    TAGS
              .make.state     .nse_depinfo
              *~      #*      .#*     ,*      _$*     *$
              *.old   *.bak   *.BAK   *.orig  *.rej   .del-*
              *.a     *.olb   *.o     *.obj   *.so    *.exe
              *.Z     *.elc   *.ln
              core

   * The per-repository list in `$CVSROOT/CVSROOT/cvsignore' is
     appended to the list, if that file exists.

   * The per-user list in `.cvsignore' in your home directory is
     appended to the list, if it exists.

   * Any entries in the environment variable `$CVSIGNORE' is appended
     to the list.

   * Any `-I' options given to CVS is appended.

   * As CVS traverses through your directories, the contents of any
     `.cvsignore' will be appended to the list.  The patterns found in
     `.cvsignore' are only valid for the directory that contains them,
     not for any sub-directories.

   In any of the 5 places listed above, a single exclamation mark (`!')
clears the ignore list.  This can be used if you want to store any file
which normally is ignored by CVS.

   Specifying `-I !' to `cvs import' will import everything, which is
generally what you want to do if you are importing files from a
pristine distribution or any other source which is known to not contain
any extraneous files.  However, looking at the rules above you will see
there is a fly in the ointment; if the distribution contains any
`.cvsignore' files, then the patterns from those files will be
processed even if `-I !' is specified.  The only workaround is to
remove the `.cvsignore' files in order to do the import.  Because this
is awkward, in the future `-I !' might be modified to override
`.cvsignore' files in each directory.


File: cvs.info,  Node: history file,  Next: Variables,  Prev: cvsignore,  Up: Administrative files

The history file
================

   The file `$CVSROOT/CVSROOT/history' is used to log information for
the `history' command (*note history::.).  This file must be created to
turn on logging.  This is done automatically if the `cvs init' command
is used to set up the repository (*note Creating a repository::.).

   The file format of the `history' file is documented only in comments
in the CVS source code, but generally programs should use the `cvs
history' command to access it anyway, in case the format changes with
future releases of CVS.


File: cvs.info,  Node: Variables,  Prev: history file,  Up: Administrative files

Expansions in administrative files
==================================

   Sometimes in writing an administrative file, you might want the file
to be able to know various things based on environment CVS is running
in.  There are several mechanisms to do that.

   To find the home directory of the user running CVS (from the `HOME'
environment variable), use `~' followed by `/' or the end of the line.
Likewise for the home directory of USER, use `~USER'.  These variables
are expanded on the server machine, and don't get any resonable
expansion if pserver (*note Password authenticated::.) is in used;
therefore user variables (see below) may be a better choice to
customize behavior based on the user running CVS.

   One may want to know about various pieces of information internal to
CVS.  A CVS internal variable has the syntax `${VARIABLE}', where
VARIABLE starts with a letter and consists of alphanumberic characters
and `_'.  If the character following VARIABLE is a non-alphanumeric
character other than `_', the `{' and `}' can be omitted.  The CVS
internal variables are:

`CVSROOT'
     This is the value of the CVS root in use.  *Note Repository::, for
     a description of the various ways to specify this.

`RCSBIN'
     This is the value CVS is using for where to find RCS binaries.
     *Note Global options::, for a description of how to specify this.

`CVSEDITOR'
`VISUAL'
`EDITOR'
     These all expand to the same value, which is the editor that CVS
     is using.  *Note Global options::, for how to specify this.

`USER'
     Username of the user running CVS (on the CVS server machine).

   If you want to pass a value to the administrative files which the
user that is running CVS can specify, use a user variable.  To expand a
user variable, the administrative file contains `${=VARIABLE}'.  To set
a user variable, specify the global option `-s' to CVS, with argument
`VARIABLE=VALUE'.  It may be particularly useful to specify this option
via `.cvsrc' (*note ~/.cvsrc::.).

   For example, if you want the administrative file to refer to a test
directory you might create a user variable `TESTDIR'.  Then if CVS is
invoked as

     cvs -s TESTDIR=/work/local/tests

and the administrative file contains `sh ${=TESTDIR}/runtests', then
that string is expanded to `sh /work/local/tests/runtests'.

   All other strings containing `$' are reserved; there is no way to
quote a `$' character so that `$' represents itself.

`$CVSUMASK'

`cannot change permissions on temporary directory'
          Operation not permitted
     This message has been happening in a non-reproducible, occasional
     way when we run the client/server testsuite, both on Red Hat Linux
     3.0.3 and 4.1.  We haven't been able to figure out what causes it,
     nor is it known whether it is specific to linux (or even to this
     particular machine!).  If the problem does occur on other unices,
     `Operation not permitted' would be likely to read `Not owner' or
     whatever the system in question uses for the unix `EPERM' error.
     If you have any information to add, please let us know as
     described in *Note BUGS::.  If you experience this error while
     using CVS, retrying the operation which produced it should work
     fine.

`cvs [checkout aborted]: cannot rename file FILE to CVS/,,FILE: Invalid argument'
     This message has been reported as intermittently happening with
     CVS 1.9 on Solaris 2.5.  The cause is unknown; if you know more
     about what causes it, let us know as described in *Note BUGS::.

a239 14
`rcs error: Unknown option: -x,v/'
     This message will be followed by a usage message for RCS.  It
     means that you have an old version of RCS (probably supplied with
     your operating system).  CVS only works with RCS version 5 and
     later.

`cvs [server aborted]: received broken pipe signal'
     This message seems to be caused by a hard-to-track-down bug in CVS
     or the systems it runs on (we don't know--we haven't tracked it
     down yet!).  It seems to happen only after a CVS command has
     completed, and you should be able to just ignore the message.
     However, if you have discovered information concerning its cause,
     please let us know as described in *Note BUGS::.

Other common problems
=====================

   Here is a list of problems which cannot be readily looked up based
on an error message.  They are in no particular order.

   * If `cvs update' finds a conflict and tries to merge, as described
     in *Note Conflicts example::, but doesn't tell you there were
     conflicts, then you may have an old version of RCS.  For more
     information on how to set this up, see the `INSTALL' file in the

File: cvs.info,  Node: Wrappers,  Next: commit files,  Prev: modules,  Up: Administrative files

The cvswrappers file
====================

   Wrappers allow you to set a hook which transforms files on their way
in and out of CVS.

   The file `cvswrappers' defines the script that will be run on a file
when its name matches a regular expresion. There are two scripts that
can be run on a file or directory. One script is executed on the
file/directory before being checked into the repository (this is denoted
with the `-t' flag) and the other when the file is checked out of the
repository (this is denoted with the `-f' flag).  The `-t'/`-f' feature
does not work with client/server CVS.

   The `cvswrappers' also has a `-m' option to specify the merge
methodology that should be used when the file is updated.  `MERGE'
means the usual CVS behavior: try to merge the files.  `COPY' means
that `cvs update' will refuse to merge files, as it also does for files
specified as binary with `-kb'.  CVS will provide the user with the two
versions of the files, and require the user using mechanisms outside
CVS, to insert any necessary changes.  *WARNING*: do not use `COPY' with
CVS 1.9 or earlier-such versions of CVS will copy one version of your
file over the other, wiping out the previous contents.  The `-m'
wrapper option only affects behavior when merging is done on update; it
does not affect how files are stored.  See *Note Binary files::, for
more on binary files.

   The basic format of the file `cvswrappers' is:

     wildcard     [option value][option value]...
     
     where option is one of
     -f           from cvs filter         value: path to filter
     -t           to cvs filter           value: path to filter
     -m           update methodology      value: MERGE or COPY
     -k           keyword expansion       value: expansion mode
     
     and value is a single-quote delimited value.

     *.nib    -f 'unwrap %s' -t 'wrap %s %s' -m 'COPY'
     *.c      -t 'indent %s %s'

The above example of a `cvswrappers' file states that all
files/directories that end with a `.nib' should be filtered with the
`wrap' program before checking the file into the repository. The file
should be filtered though the `unwrap' program when the file is checked
out of the repository. The `cvswrappers' file also states that a `COPY'
methodology should be used when updating the files in the repository
(that is, no merging should be performed).

   The last example line says that all files that end with `.c' should
be filtered with `indent' before being checked into the repository.
Unlike the previous example, no filtering of the `.c' file is done when
it is checked out of the repository.

The `-t' filter is called with two arguments, the first is the name of
the file/directory to filter and the second is the pathname to where
the resulting filtered file should be placed.

The `-f' filter is called with one argument, which is the name of the
file to filter from. The end result of this filter will be a file in
the users directory that they can work on as they normally would.

   Note that the `-t'/`-f' features do not conveniently handle one
portion of CVS's operation: determining when files are modified.  CVS
will still want a file (or directory) to exist, and it will use its
modification time to determine whether a file is modified.  If CVS
erroneously thinks a file is unmodified (for example, a directory is
unchanged but one of the files within it is changed), you can force it
to check in the file anyway by specifying the `-f' option to `cvs
commit' (*note commit options::.).

   For another example, the following command imports a directory,
treating files whose name ends in `.exe' as binary:

     cvs import -I ! -W "*.exe -k 'b'" first-dir vendortag reltag


File: cvs.info,  Node: commit files,  Next: commitinfo,  Prev: Wrappers,  Up: Administrative files

The commit support files
========================

   The `-i' flag in the `modules' file can be used to run a certain
program whenever files are committed (*note modules::.).  The files
described in this section provide other, more flexible, ways to run
programs whenever something is committed.

   There are three kind of programs that can be run on commit.  They
are specified in files in the repository, as described below.  The
following table summarizes the file names and the purpose of the
corresponding programs.

`commitinfo'
     The program is responsible for checking that the commit is
     allowed.  If it exits with a non-zero exit status the commit will
     be aborted.

`verifymsg'
     The specified program is used to evaluate the log message, and
     possibly verify that it contains all required fields.  This is
     most useful in combination with the `rcsinfo' file, which can hold
     a log message template (*note rcsinfo::.).

`editinfo'
     The specified program is used to edit the log message, and
     possibly verify that it contains all required fields.  This is
     most useful in combination with the `rcsinfo' file, which can hold
     a log message template (*note rcsinfo::.).  (obsolete)

`loginfo'
     The specified program is called when the commit is complete.  It
     receives the log message and some additional information and can
     store the log message in a file, or mail it to appropriate
     persons, or maybe post it to a local newsgroup, or...  Your
     imagination is the limit!

The common syntax
-----------------

   The administrative files such as `commitinfo', `loginfo', `rcsinfo',
`verifymsg', etc., all have a common format.  The purpose of the files
are described later on.  The common syntax is described here.

   Each line contains the following:
   * A regular expression.  This is a basic regular expression in the
     syntax used by GNU emacs.

   * A whitespace separator--one or more spaces and/or tabs.

   * A file name or command-line template.

Blank lines are ignored.  Lines that start with the character `#' are
treated as comments.  Long lines unfortunately can *not* be broken in
two parts in any way.

   The first regular expression that matches the current directory name
in the repository is used.  The rest of the line is used as a file name
or command-line as appropriate.


File: cvs.info,  Node: commitinfo,  Next: verifymsg,  Prev: commit files,  Up: Administrative files

Commitinfo
==========

   The `commitinfo' file defines programs to execute whenever `cvs
commit' is about to execute.  These programs are used for pre-commit
checking to verify that the modified, added and removed files are really
ready to be committed.  This could be used, for instance, to verify
that the changed files conform to to your site's standards for coding
practice.

   As mentioned earlier, each line in the `commitinfo' file consists of
a regular expression and a command-line template.  The template can
include a program name and any number of arguments you wish to supply
to it.  The full path to the current source repository is appended to
the template, followed by the file names of any files involved in the
commit (added, removed, and modified files).

   The first line with a regular expression matching the relative path
to the module will be used.  If the command returns a non-zero exit
status the commit will be aborted.

   If the repository name does not match any of the regular expressions
in this file, the `DEFAULT' line is used, if it is specified.

   All occurances of the name `ALL' appearing as a regular expression
are used in addition to the first matching regular expression or the
name `DEFAULT'.

   Note: when CVS is accessing a remote repository, `commitinfo' will
be run on the *remote* (i.e., server) side, not the client side (*note
Remote repositories::.).


File: cvs.info,  Node: verifymsg,  Next: editinfo,  Prev: commitinfo,  Up: Administrative files

Verifying log messages
======================

   Once you have entered a log message, you can evaluate that message
to check for specific content, such as a bug ID.  Use the `verifymsg'
file to specify a program that is used to verify the log message.  This
program could be a simple script that checks that the entered message
contains the required fields.

   The `verifymsg' file is often most useful together with the
`rcsinfo' file, which can be used to specify a log message template.

   Each line in the `verifymsg' file consists of a regular expression
and a command-line template.  The template must include a program name,
and can include any number of arguments.  The full path to the current
log message template file is appended to the template.

   One thing that should be noted is that the `ALL' keyword is not
supported.  If more than one matching line is found, the first one is
used.  This can be useful for specifying a default verification script
in a module, and then overriding it in a subdirectory.

   If the repository name does not match any of the regular expressions
in this file, the `DEFAULT' line is used, if it is specified.

   If the verification script exits with a non-zero exit status, the
commit is aborted.

   Note that the verification script cannot change the log message; it
can merely accept it or reject it.

   The following is a little silly example of a `verifymsg' file,
together with the corresponding `rcsinfo' file, the log message
template and an verification  script.  We begin with the log message
template.  We want to always record a bug-id number on the first line
of the log message.  The rest of log message is free text.  The
following template is found in the file `/usr/cvssupport/tc.template'.

     BugId:

   The script `/usr/cvssupport/bugid.verify' is used to evaluate the
log message.

     #!/bin/sh
     #
     #       bugid.verify filename

Editinfo
========

   *NOTE:* The `editinfo' feature has been rendered obsolete.  To set a
default editor for log messages use the `EDITOR' environment variable
(*note Environment variables::.) or the `-e' global option (*note
Global options::.).  See *Note verifymsg::, for information on the use
of the `verifymsg' feature for evaluating log messages.

   If you want to make sure that all log messages look the same way,
you can use the `editinfo' file to specify a program that is used to
edit the log message.  This program could be a custom-made editor that
always enforces a certain style of the log message, or maybe a simple
shell script that calls an editor, and checks that the entered message
contains the required fields.

   If no matching line is found in the `editinfo' file, the editor
specified in the environment variable `$CVSEDITOR' is used instead.  If
that variable is not set, then the environment variable `$EDITOR' is
used instead.  If that variable is not set a default will be used.  See
*Note Committing your changes::.

   The `editinfo' file is often most useful together with the `rcsinfo'
file, which can be used to specify a log message template.

   Each line in the `editinfo' file consists of a regular expression
and a command-line template.  The template must include a program name,
and can include any number of arguments.  The full path to the current
log message template file is appended to the template.

   One thing that should be noted is that the `ALL' keyword is not
supported.  If more than one matching line is found, the first one is
used.  This can be useful for specifying a default edit script in a
module, and then overriding it in a subdirectory.

   If the repository name does not match any of the regular expressions
in this file, the `DEFAULT' line is used, if it is specified.

   If the edit script exits with a non-zero exit status, the commit is
aborted.

   Note: when CVS is accessing a remote repository, or when the `-m' or
`-F' options to `cvs commit' are used, `editinfo' will not be consulted.
There is no good workaround for this; use `verifymsg' instead.

Editinfo example
----------------

   The following is a little silly example of a `editinfo' file,
together with the corresponding `rcsinfo' file, the log message
template and an editor script.  We begin with the log message template.
We want to always record a bug-id number on the first line of the log
message.  The rest of log message is free text.  The following template
is found in the file `/usr/cvssupport/tc.template'.

     BugId:

   The script `/usr/cvssupport/bugid.edit' is used to edit the log
message.

     #!/bin/sh
     #
     #       bugid.edit filename
     #
     #  Call $EDITOR on FILENAME, and verify that the
     #  resulting file contains a valid bugid on the first
     #  line.
     if [ "x$EDITOR" = "x" ]; then EDITOR=vi; fi
     if [ "x$CVSEDITOR" = "x" ]; then CVSEDITOR=$EDITOR; fi
     $CVSEDITOR $1
     until head -1|grep '^BugId:[ ]*[0-9][0-9]*$' < $1
     do  echo -n  "No BugId found.  Edit again? ([y]/n)"
         read ans
         case ${ans} in
             n*) exit 1;;
         esac
         $CVSEDITOR $1
     done

   The `editinfo' file contains this line:

     ^tc     /usr/cvssupport/bugid.edit

   The `rcsinfo' file contains this line:

     ^tc     /usr/cvssupport/tc.template


File: cvs.info,  Node: loginfo,  Next: rcsinfo,  Prev: editinfo,  Up: Administrative files

Loginfo
=======

   The `loginfo' file is used to control where `cvs commit' log
information is sent.  The first entry on a line is a regular expression
which is tested against the directory that the change is being made to,
relative to the `$CVSROOT'.  If a match is found, then the remainder of
the line is a filter program that should expect log information on its
standard input.

   If the repository name does not match any of the regular expressions
in this file, the `DEFAULT' line is used, if it is specified.

   All occurances of the name `ALL' appearing as a regular expression
are used in addition to the first matching regular expression or
`DEFAULT'.

   The first matching regular expression is used.

   *Note commit files::, for a description of the syntax of the
`loginfo' file.

   The user may specify a format string as part of the filter.  The
string is composed of a `%' followed by a space, or followed by a single
format character, or followed by a set of format characters surrounded
by `{' and `}' as separators.  The format characters are:

s
     file name

V
     old version number (pre-checkin)

v
     new version number (post-checkin)

   All other characters that appear in a format string expand to an
empty field (commas separating fields are still provided).

   For example, some valid format strings are `%', `%s', `%{s}', and
`%{sVv}'.

   The output will be a string of tokens separated by spaces.  For
backwards compatibility, the first token will be the repository name.
The rest of the tokens will be comma-delimited lists of the information
requested in the format string.  For example, if `/u/src/master' is the
repository, `%{sVv}' is the format string, and three files (ChangeLog,
Makefile, foo.c) were modified, the output might be:

     /u/src/master ChangeLog,1.1,1.2 Makefile,1.3,1.4 foo.c,1.12,1.13

   As another example, `%{}' means that only the name of the repository
will be generated.

   Note: when CVS is accessing a remote repository, `loginfo' will be
run on the *remote* (i.e., server) side, not the client side (*note
Remote repositories::.).

Loginfo example
---------------

   The following `loginfo' file, together with the tiny shell-script
below, appends all log messages to the file
`$CVSROOT/CVSROOT/commitlog', and any commits to the administrative
files (inside the `CVSROOT' directory) are also logged in
`/usr/adm/cvsroot-log'.

     ALL             /usr/local/bin/cvs-log $CVSROOT/CVSROOT/commitlog
     ^CVSROOT        /usr/local/bin/cvs-log /usr/adm/cvsroot-log

   The shell-script `/usr/local/bin/cvs-log' looks like this:

     #!/bin/sh
     (echo "------------------------------------------------------";
      echo -n $USER"  ";
      date;
      echo;
      sed '1s+'${CVSROOT}'++') >> $1


File: cvs.info,  Node: Keeping a checked out copy,  Prev: loginfo example,  Up: loginfo

Keeping a checked out copy
--------------------------

   It is often useful to maintain a directory tree which contains files
which correspond to the latest version in the repository.  For example,
other developers might want to refer to the latest sources without
having to check them out, or you might be maintaining a web site with
CVS and want every checkin to cause the files used by the web server to
be updated.

   The way to do this is by having loginfo invoke `cvs update'.  Doing
so in the naive way will cause a problem with locks, so the `cvs update'
must be run in the background.  Here is an example (this should all be
on one line):

     ^cyclic-pages		(date; cat; (sleep 2; cd /u/www/local-docs;
      cvs -q update -d) &) >> $CVSROOT/CVSROOT/updatelog 2>&1

   This will cause checkins to repository directories starting with
`cyclic-pages' to update the checked out tree in `/u/www/local-docs'.


File: cvs.info,  Node: rcsinfo,  Next: cvsignore,  Prev: loginfo,  Up: Administrative files

Rcsinfo
=======

   The `rcsinfo' file can be used to specify a form to edit when
filling out the commit log.  The `rcsinfo' file has a syntax similar to
the `verifymsg', `commitinfo' and `loginfo' files.  *Note syntax::.
Unlike the other files the second part is *not* a command-line
template.  Instead, the part after the regular expression should be a
full pathname to a file containing the log message template.

   If the repository name does not match any of the regular expressions
in this file, the `DEFAULT' line is used, if it is specified.

   All occurances of the name `ALL' appearing as a regular expression
are used in addition to the first matching regular expression or
`DEFAULT'.

   The log message template will be used as a default log message.  If
you specify a log message with `cvs commit -m MESSAGE' or `cvs commit -f
FILE' that log message will override the template.

   *Note verifymsg::, for an example `rcsinfo' file.

   When CVS is accessing a remote repository, the contents of `rcsinfo'
at the time a directory is first checked out will specify a template
which does not then change.  If you edit `rcsinfo' or its templates,
you may need to check out a new working directory.


a88 7
   Note that the syntax of the ignore files consists of a series of
lines, each of which contains a space separated list of filenames.
This offers no clean way to specify filenames which contain spaces, but
you can use a workaround like `foo?bar' to match a file named `foo bar'
(it also matches `fooxbar' and the like).  Also note that there is
currently no way to specify comments.

The CVSROOT/config configuration file
=====================================

   The administrative file `config' contains various miscellaneous
settings which affect the behavior of CVS.  The syntax is slightly
different from the other administrative files.  Variables are not
expanded.  Lines which start with `#' are considered comments.  Other
lines consist of a keyword, `=', and a value.  Note that this syntax is
very strict.  Extraneous spaces or tabs are not permitted.

   Currently defined keywords are:

`RCSBIN=BINDIR'
     For CVS 1.9.12 through 1.9.18, this setting told CVS to look for
     RCS programs in the BINDIR directory.  Current versions of CVS do
     not run RCS programs; for compatibility this setting is accepted,
     but it does nothing.

`SystemAuth=VALUE'
     If VALUE is `yes', then pserver should check for users in the
     system's user database if not found in `CVSROOT/passwd'.  If it is
     `no', then all pserver users must exist in `CVSROOT/passwd'.  The
     default is `yes'.  For more on pserver, see *Note Password
     authenticated::.

     repository (where the RCS files are kept).  This information must
     be available to CVS for most commands to execute; if `$CVSROOT' is
     not set, or if you wish to override it for one invocation, you can
     supply it on the command line: `cvs -d cvsroot cvs_command...'
     Once you have checked out a working directory, CVS stores the
     appropriate root (in the file `CVS/Root'), so normally you only
     need to worry about this when initially checking out a working
     directory.

`$HOMEDRIVE'
     Used to locate the directory where the `.cvsrc' file, and other
     such files, are searched.  On Unix, CVS just checks for HOME.  On
     Windows NT, the system will set HOMEDRIVE, for example to `d:' and
     HOMEPATH, for example to `\joe'.  On Windows 95, you'll probably
     need to set HOMEDRIVE and HOMEPATH yourself.

Compatibility between CVS Versions
**********************************

   The repository format is compatible going back to CVS 1.3.  But see
*Note Watches Compatibility::, if you have copies of CVS 1.6 or older
and you want to use the optional developer communication features.

   The working directory format is compatible going back to CVS 1.5.
It did change between CVS 1.3 and CVS 1.5.  If you run CVS 1.5 or newer
on a working directory checked out with CVS 1.3, CVS will convert it,
but to go back to CVS 1.3 you need to check out a new working directory
with CVS 1.3.

   The remote protocol is interoperable going back to CVS 1.5, but no
further (1.5 was the first official release with the remote protocol,
but some older versions might still be floating around).  In many cases
you need to upgrade both the client and the server to take advantage of
new features and bugfixes, however.

`cvs COMMAND: authorization failed: server HOST rejected access'
     This is a generic response when trying to connect to a pserver
     server which chooses not to provide a specific reason for denying
     authorization.  Check that the username and password specified are
     correct and that the CVSROOT specified is allowed by -allow-root
     in inetd.conf.  See *Note Password authenticated::.

`FILE:LINE: Assertion 'TEXT' failed'
     The exact format of this message may vary depending on your
     system.  It indicates a bug in CVS, which can be handled as
     described in *Note BUGS::.

a356 6
`cvs [init aborted]: cannot open CVS/Root: No such file or directory'
     This message is harmless.  Provided it is not accompanied by other
     errors, the operation has completed successfully.  This message
     should not occur with current versions of CVS, but it is documented
     here for the benefit of CVS 1.9 and older.

a361 36
`cvs [COMMAND aborted]: cannot start server via rcmd'
     This, unfortunately, is a rather nonspecific error message which
     CVS 1.9 will print if you are running the CVS client and it is
     having trouble connecting to the server.  Current versions of CVS
     should print a much more specific error message.  If you get this
     message when you didn't mean to run the client at all, you
     probably forgot to specify `:local:', as described in *Note
     Repository::.

`ci: FILE,v: bad diff output line: Binary files - and /tmp/T2a22651 differ'
     CVS 1.9 and older will print this message when trying to check in
     a binary file if RCS is not correctly installed.  Re-read the
     instructions that came with your RCS distribution and the INSTALL
     file in the CVS distribution.  Alternately, upgrade to a current
     version of CVS, which checks in files itself rather than via RCS.

`cvs checkout: could not check out FILE'
     With CVS 1.9, this can mean that the `co' program (part of RCS)
     returned a failure.  It should be preceded by another error
     message, however it has been observed without another error
     message and the cause is not well-understood.  With the current
     version of CVS, which does not run `co', if this message occurs
     without another error message, it is definitely a CVS bug (*note
     BUGS::.).

`cvs [login aborted]: could not find out home directory'
     This means that you need to set the environment variables that CVS
     uses to locate your home directory.  See the discussion of HOME,
     HOMEDRIVE, and HOMEPATH in *Note Environment variables::.

`cvs update: could not merge revision REV of FILE: No such file or directory'
     CVS 1.9 and older will print this message if there was a problem
     finding the `rcsmerge' program.  Make sure that it is in your
     `PATH', or upgrade to a current version of CVS, which does not
     require an external `rcsmerge' program.

     FILE.  If both the client and the server are running a current
     version of CVS, then there is no need for an external patch

     or server is running CVS 1.9, then you need `patch'.
d375 6
a380 7
     There is a known bug in the server for CVS 1.9.18 and older which
     can cause this.  For me, this was reproducible if I used the `-t'
     global option.  It was fixed by Andy Piper's 14 Nov 1997 change to
     src/filesubr.c, if anyone is curious.  If you see the message, you
     probably can just retry the operation which failed, or if you have
     discovered information concerning its cause, please let us know as
     described in *Note BUGS::.
a402 15
`missing author'
     Typically this can happen if you created an RCS file with your
     username set to empty.  CVS will, bogusly, create an illegal RCS
     file with no value for the author field.  The solution is to make
     sure your username is set to a non-empty value and re-create the
     RCS file.

`*PANIC* administration files missing'
     This typically means that there is a directory named CVS but it
     does not contain the administrative files which CVS puts in a CVS
     directory.  If the problem is that you created a CVS directory via
     some mechanism other than CVS, then the answer is simple, use a
     name other than CVS.  If not, it indicates a CVS bug (*note
     BUGS::.).

a416 12
`Too many arguments!'
     This message is typically printed by the `log.pl' script which is
     in the `contrib' directory in the CVS source distribution.  In
     some versions of CVS, `log.pl' has been part of the default CVS
     installation.  The `log.pl' script gets called from the `loginfo'
     administrative file.  Check that the arguments passed in `loginfo'
     match what your version of `log.pl' expects.  In particular, the
     `log.pl' from CVS 1.3 and older expects the logfile as an argument
     whereas the `log.pl' from CVS 1.5 and newer expects the logfile to
     be specified with a `-f' option.  Of course, if you don't need
     `log.pl' you can just comment it out of `loginfo'.

d433 5
a437 15
     the message will vary depending on the system.  The simplest
     solution is to upgrade to a current version of CVS, which does not
     rely on external `rcsmerge' or `diff3' programs.

`warning: unrecognized response `TEXT' from cvs server'
     If TEXT contains a valid response (such as `ok') followed by an
     extra carriage return character (on many systems this will cause
     the second part of the message to overwrite the first part), then
     it probably means that you are using the `:ext:' access method
     with a version of rsh, such as most non-unix rsh versions, which
     does not by default provide a transparent data stream.  In such
     cases you probably want to try `:server:' instead of `:ext:'.  If
     TEXT is something else, this may signify a problem with your CVS
     server.  Double-check your installation against the instructions
     for setting up the CVS server.
d458 5
a462 6
   * If you are running CVS 1.9.18 or older, and `cvs update' finds a
     conflict and tries to merge, as described in *Note Conflicts
     example::, but doesn't tell you there were conflicts, then you may
     have an old version of RCS.  The easiest solution probably is to
     upgrade to a current version of CVS, which does not rely on
     external RCS programs.

Alias modules
-------------

   Alias modules are the simplest kind of module:

`MNAME -a ALIASES...'
     This represents the simplest way of defining a module MNAME.  The
     `-a' flags the definition as a simple alias: CVS will treat any
     use of MNAME (as a command argument) as if the list of names
     ALIASES had been specified instead.  ALIASES may contain either
     other module names or paths.  When you use paths in aliases,
     `checkout' creates all intermediate directories in the working
     directory, just as if the path had been specified explicitly in
     the CVS arguments.

   For example, if the modules file contains:

     amodule -a first-dir

then the following two commands are equivalent:

     $ cvs co amodule
     $ cvs co first-dir

and they each would provide output such as:

     cvs checkout: Updating first-dir
     U first-dir/file1
     U first-dir/file2
     cvs checkout: Updating first-dir/sdir
     U first-dir/sdir/sfile


File: cvs.info,  Node: Regular modules,  Next: Ampersand modules,  Prev: Alias modules,  Up: modules

Regular modules
---------------

`MNAME [ options ] DIR [ FILES... ]'
     In the simplest case, this form of module definition reduces to
     `MNAME DIR'.  This defines all the files in directory DIR as
     module mname.  DIR is a relative path (from `$CVSROOT') to a
     directory of source in the source repository.  In this case, on
     checkout, a single directory called MNAME is created as a working
     directory; no intermediate directory levels are used by default,
     even if DIR was a path involving several directory levels.

   For example, if a module is defined by:

     regmodule first-dir

then regmodule will contain the files from first-dir:

     $ cvs co regmodule
     cvs checkout: Updating regmodule
     U regmodule/file1
     U regmodule/file2
     cvs checkout: Updating regmodule/sdir
     U regmodule/sdir/sfile
     $

   By explicitly specifying files in the module definition after DIR,
you can select particular files from directory DIR.  Here is an example:

     regfiles first-dir/sdir sfile

With this definition, getting the regfiles module will create a single
working directory `regfiles' containing the file listed, which comes
from a directory deeper in the CVS source repository:

     $ cvs co regfiles
     U regfiles/sfile
     $


File: cvs.info,  Node: Ampersand modules,  Next: Excluding directories,  Prev: Regular modules,  Up: modules

Ampersand modules
-----------------

   A module definition can refer to other modules by including
`&MODULE' in its definition.
     MNAME [ options ] &MODULE...

   Then getting the module creates a subdirectory for each such module,
in the directory containing the module.  For example, if modules
contains

     ampermod &first-dir

   then a checkout will create an `ampermod' directory which contains a
directory called `first-dir', which in turns contains all the
directories and files which live there.  For example, the command

     $ cvs co ampermod

will create the following files:

     ampermod/first-dir/file1
     ampermod/first-dir/file2
     ampermod/first-dir/sdir/sfile

   There is one quirk/bug: the messages that CVS prints omit the
`ampermod', and thus do not correctly display the location to which it
is checking out the files:

     $ cvs co ampermod
     cvs checkout: Updating first-dir
     U first-dir/file1
     U first-dir/file2
     cvs checkout: Updating first-dir/sdir
     U first-dir/sdir/sfile
     $

   Do not rely on this buggy behavior; it may get fixed in a future
release of CVS.

Excluding directories
---------------------

   An alias module may exclude particular directories from other
modules by using an exclamation mark (`!') before the name of each
directory to be excluded.

   For example, if the modules file contains:

     exmodule -a first-dir !first-dir/sdir

   then checking out the module `exmodule' will check out everything in
`first-dir' except any files in the subdirectory `first-dir/sdir'.


File: cvs.info,  Node: Module options,  Prev: Excluding directories,  Up: modules

Module options
--------------

   Either regular modules or ampersand modules can contain options,
which supply additional information concerning the module.

`-d NAME'
     Name the working directory something other than the module name.

`-e PROG'
     Specify a program PROG to run whenever files in a module are
     exported.  PROG runs with a single argument, the module name.

`-i PROG'
     Specify a program PROG to run whenever files in a module are
     committed.  PROG runs with a single argument, the full pathname of
     the affected directory in a source repository.  The `commitinfo',
     `loginfo', and `verifymsg' files provide other ways to call a
     program on commit.

`-o PROG'
     Specify a program PROG to run whenever files in a module are
     checked out.  PROG runs with a single argument, the module name.

`-s STATUS'
     Assign a status to the module.  When the module file is printed
     with `cvs checkout -s' the modules are sorted according to
     primarily module status, and secondarily according to the module
     name.  This option has no other meaning.  You can use this option
     for several things besides status: for instance, list the person
     that is responsible for this module.

`-t PROG'
     Specify a program PROG to run whenever files in a module are
     tagged with `rtag'.  PROG runs with two arguments: the module name
     and the symbolic tag specified to `rtag'.  It is not run when
     `tag' is executed.  Generally you will find that taginfo is a
     better solution (*note user-defined logging::.).

`-u PROG'
     Specify a program PROG to run whenever `cvs update' is executed
     from the top-level directory of the checked-out module.  PROG runs
     with a single argument, the full path to the source repository for
     this module.

     Enable support for saving special device files, symbolic links,
     file permissions and ownerships in the repository.  The default
     value is `no'.  *Note Special Files:: for the full implications of
     using this keyword.

methodology that should be used when a non-binary file is updated.
`MERGE' means the usual CVS behavior: try to merge the files.  `COPY'
means that `cvs update' will refuse to merge files, as it also does for
files specified as binary with `-kb' (but if the file is specified as
binary, there is no need to specify `-m 'COPY'').  CVS will provide the
user with the two versions of the files, and require the user using
mechanisms outside CVS, to insert any necessary changes.  *WARNING*: do
not use `COPY' with CVS 1.9 or earlier-such versions of CVS will copy
one version of your file over the other, wiping out the previous
contents.  The `-m' wrapper option only affects behavior when merging
is done on update; it does not affect how files are stored.  See *Note

`TopLevelAdmin=VALUE'
     Modify the `checkout' command to create a `CVS' directory at the
     top level of the new working directory, in addition to `CVS'
     directories created within checked-out directories.  The default
     value is `no'.

     This option is useful if you find yourself performing many
     commands at the top level of your working directory, rather than
     in one of the checked out subdirectories.  The `CVS' directory
     created there will mean you don't have to specify `CVSROOT' for
     each command.  It also provides a place for the `CVS/Template'
     file (*note Working directory storage::.).

Reference manual for Administrative files
*****************************************

   Inside the repository, in the directory `$CVSROOT/CVSROOT', there
are a number of supportive files for CVS.  You can use CVS in a limited
fashion without any of them, but if they are set up properly they can
help make life easier.  For a discussion of how to edit them, see *Note
Intro administrative files::.

   The most important of these files is the `modules' file, which
defines the modules inside the repository.

The modules file
================

   The `modules' file records your definitions of names for collections
of source code.  CVS will use these definitions if you use CVS to
update the modules file (use normal commands like `add', `commit', etc).

   The `modules' file may contain blank lines and comments (lines
beginning with `#') as well as module definitions.  Long lines can be
continued on the next line by specifying a backslash (`\') as the last
character on the line.

   There are three basic types of modules: alias modules, regular
modules, and ampersand modules.  The difference between them is the way
that they map files in the repository to files in the working
directory.  In all of the following examples, the top-level repository
contains a directory called `first-dir', which contains two files,
`file1' and `file2', and a directory `sdir'.  `first-dir/sdir' contains
a file `sfile'.

* Menu:

* Alias modules::             The simplest kind of module
* Regular modules::
* Ampersand modules::
* Excluding directories::     Excluding directories from a module
* Module options::            Regular and ampersand modules can take options

   Wrappers refers to a CVS feature which lets you control certain
settings based on the name of the file which is being operated on.  The
settings are `-k' for binary files, and `-m' for nonmergeable text
files.

   The `-m' option specifies the merge methodology that should be used
when a non-binary file is updated.  `MERGE' means the usual CVS
behavior: try to merge the files.  `COPY' means that `cvs update' will
refuse to merge files, as it also does for files specified as binary
with `-kb' (but if the file is specified as binary, there is no need to
specify `-m 'COPY'').  CVS will provide the user with the two versions
of the files, and require the user using mechanisms outside CVS, to
insert any necessary changes.  *WARNING*: do not use `COPY' with CVS
1.9 or earlier-such versions of CVS will copy one version of your file
over the other, wiping out the previous contents.  The `-m' wrapper
option only affects behavior when merging is done on update; it does
not affect how files are stored.  See *Note Binary files::, for more on
binary files.

files whose name ends in `.exe' as binary:

File: cvs.info,  Node: Module program options,  Prev: Module options,  Up: modules

How the modules file "program options" programs are run
-------------------------------------------------------

For checkout, rtag, and export, the program is server-based, and as
such the following applies:-

   If using remote access methods (pserver, ext, etc.), CVS will
execute this program on the server from a temporary directory. The path
is searched for this program.

   If using "local access" (on a local or remote NFS filesystem, i.e.
repository set just to a path), the program will be executed from the
newly checked-out tree, if found there, or alternatively searched for
in the path if not.

The commit and update programs are locally-based, and are run as
follows:-

   The program is always run locally. One must re-checkout the tree one
is using if these options are updated in the modules administrative
file. The file CVS/Checkin.prog contains the value of the option `-i'
set in the modules file, and similarly for the file CVS/Update.prog and
`-u'. The program is always executed from the top level of the
checked-out copy on the client. Again, the program is first searched
for in the checked-out copy and then using the path.

   The programs are all run after the operation has effectively
completed.

the information requested in the format string.  For example, if
`/u/src/master/yoyodyne/tc' is the repository, `%{sVv}' is the format
string, and three files (ChangeLog, Makefile, foo.c) were modified, the
output might be:
