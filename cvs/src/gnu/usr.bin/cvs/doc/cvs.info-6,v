All environment variables which affect CVS
******************************************

   This is a complete list of all environment variables that affect CVS.

`$CVSIGNORE'
     A whitespace-separated list of file name patterns that CVS should
     ignore. *Note cvsignore::.

`$CVSWRAPPERS'
     A whitespace-separated list of file name patterns that CVS should
     treat as wrappers. *Note Wrappers::.

`$CVSREAD'
     If this is set, `checkout' and `update' will try hard to make the
     files in your working directory read-only.  When this is not set,
     the default behavior is to permit modification of your working
     files.

`$CVSROOT'
     Should contain the full pathname to the root of the CVS source
     repository (where the RCS history files are kept).  This
     information must be available to CVS for most commands to execute;
     if `$CVSROOT' is not set, or if you wish to override it for one
     invocation, you can supply it on the command line: `cvs -d cvsroot
     cvs_command...' Once you have checked out a working directory, CVS
     stores the appropriate root (in the file `CVS/Root'), so normally
     you only need to worry about this when initially checking out a
     working directory.

`$EDITOR'
`$CVSEDITOR'
     Specifies the program to use for recording log messages during
     commit.  If not set, the default is `/usr/ucb/vi'.  `$CVSEDITOR'
     overrides `$EDITOR'.  `$CVSEDITOR' does not exist in CVS 1.3, but
     the next release will probably include it.

`$PATH'
     If `$RCSBIN' is not set, and no path is compiled into CVS, it will
     use `$PATH' to try to find all programs it uses.

`$RCSBIN'
     This is the value CVS is using for where to find RCS binaries.
     *Note Global options::, for a description of how to specify this.
     If not set, a compiled-in value is used, or your `$PATH' is
     searched.

`$HOME'
`$HOMEPATH'
     Used to locate the directory where the `.cvsrc' file is searched
     (`$HOMEPATH' is used for Windows-NT).  *note ~/.cvsrc::.

`$CVS_RSH'
     Specifies the external program which CVS connects with, when
     `:ext:' access method is specified.  *note Connecting via rsh::..

`$CVS_SERVER'
     Used in client-server mode when accessing a remote repository
     using RSH.  It specifies the name of the program to start on the
     server side when accessing a remote repository using RSH.  The
     default value is `cvs'.  *note Connecting via rsh::.

`$CVS_PASSFILE'
     Used in client-server mode when accessing the `cvs login server'.
     Default value is `$HOME/.cvspass'.  *note Password authentication
     client::.

`$CVS_PASSWORD'
     Used in client-server mode when accessing the `cvs login server'.
     *note Password authentication client::.

`$CVS_CLIENT_PORT'
     Used in client-server mode when accessing the server via Kerberos.
     *note Kerberos authenticated::.

`$CVS_RCMD_PORT'
     Used in client-server mode.  If set, specifies the port number to
     be used when accessing the RCMD demon on the server side.
     (Currently not used for Unix clients).

`$CVS_CLIENT_LOG'
     Used for debugging only in client-server mode.  If set, everything
     send to the server is logged into ``$CVS_CLIENT_LOG'.in' and
     everything send from the server is logged into
     ``$CVS_CLIENT_LOG'.out'.

`$CVS_SERVER_SLEEP'
     Used only for debugging the server side in client-server mode.  If
     set, delays the start of the server child process the the
     specified amount of seconds so that you can attach to it with a
     debugger.

`$CVS_IGNORE_REMOTE_ROOT'
     (What is the purpose of this variable?)

`$COMSPEC'
     Used under OS/2 only.  It specifies the name of the command
     interpreter and defaults to CMD.EXE.

`$TMPDIR'
`$TMP'
`$TEMP'
     Directory in which temporary files are located.  Those parts of
     CVS which are implemented using RCS inspect the above variables in
     the order they appear above and the first value found is taken; if
     none of them are set, a host-dependent default is used, typically
     `/tmp'.  The CVS server uses `TMPDIR'.  *Note Global options::,
     for a description of how to specify this.  Some parts of CVS will
     always use `/tmp' (via the `tmpnam' function provided by the
     system).

     On Windows NT, `TMP' is used (via the `_tempnam' function provided
     by the system).

     The `patch' program which is used by the CVS client uses `TMPDIR',
     and if it is not set, uses `/tmp' (at least with GNU patch 2.1).

   CVS invokes RCS to perform certain operations.  The following
environment variables affect RCS.  Note that if you are using the
client/server CVS, these variables need to be set on the server side
(which may or not may be possible depending on how you are connecting).
There is probably not any need to set any of them, however.

`$LOGNAME'
`$USER'
     If set, they affect who RCS thinks you are.  If you have trouble
     checking in files it might be because your login name differs from
     the setting of e.g.  `$LOGNAME'.

`$RCSINIT'
     Options prepended to the argument list, separated by spaces.  A
     backslash escapes spaces within an option.  The `$RCSINIT' options
     are prepended to the argument lists of most RCS commands.

Magic branch numbers
====================

   Externally, branch numbers consist of an odd number of dot-separated
decimal integers.  *Note Revision numbers::.  That is not the whole
truth, however.  For efficiency reasons CVS sometimes inserts an extra 0
in the second rightmost position (1.2.3 becomes 1.2.0.3, 8.9.10.11.12
becomes 8.9.10.11.0.12 and so on).

   CVS does a pretty good job at hiding these so called magic branches,
but in a few places the hiding is incomplete:

   * The magic branch number appears in the output from `cvs log'.

   * You cannot specify a symbolic branch name to `cvs admin'.

   You can use the `admin' command to reassign a symbolic name to a
branch the way RCS expects it to be.  If `R4patches' is assigned to the
branch 1.4.2 (magic branch number 1.4.0.2) in file `numbers.c' you can
do this:

     $ cvs admin -NR4patches:1.4.2 numbers.c

   It only works if at least one revision is already committed on the
branch.  Be very careful so that you do not assign the tag to the wrong
number.  (There is no way to see how the tag was assigned yesterday).

The cvswrappers file
====================

   Wrappers allow you to set a hook which transforms files on their way
in and out of CVS.  Most or all of the wrappers features do not work
with client/server CVS.

   The file `cvswrappers' defines the script that will be run on a file
when its name matches a regular expresion. There are two scripts that
can be run on a file or directory. One script is executed on the
file/directory before being checked into the repository (this is denoted
with the `-t' flag) and the other when the file is checked out of the
repository (this is denoted with the `-f' flag)

   The `cvswrappers' also has a `-m' option to specify the merge
methodology that should be used when the file is updated.  `MERGE'
means the usual CVS behavior: try to merge the files (this generally
will not work for binary files).  `COPY' means that `cvs update' will
merely copy one version over the other, and require the user using
mechanisms outside CVS, to insert any necessary changes.  The `-m'
wrapper option only affects behavior when merging is done on update; it
does not affect how files are stored.  See *Note Binary files::, for
more on binary files.

   The basic format of the file `cvswrappers' is:

     wildcard     [option value][option value]...
     
     where option is one of
     -f           from cvs filter         value: path to filter
     -t           to cvs filter           value: path to filter
     -m           update methodology      value: MERGE or COPY
     -k           keyword expansion       value: expansion mode
     
     and value is a single-quote delimited value.

     *.nib    -f 'unwrap %s' -t 'wrap %s %s' -m 'COPY'
     *.c      -t 'indent %s %s'

The above example of a `cvswrappers' file states that all
files/directories that end with a `.nib' should be filtered with the
`wrap' program before checking the file into the repository. The file
should be filtered though the `unwrap' program when the file is checked
out of the repository. The `cvswrappers' file also states that a `COPY'
methodology should be used when updating the files in the repository
(that is no merging should be performed).

   The last example line says that all files that end with a `*.c'
should be filtered with `indent' before being checked into the
repository. Unlike the previous example no filtering of the `*.c' file
is done when it is checked out of the repository.

The `-t' filter is called with two arguments, the first is the name of
the file/directory to filter and the second is the pathname to where
the resulting filtered file should be placed.

The `-f' filter is called with one argument, which is the name of the
file to filter from. The end result of this filter will be a file in
the users directory that they can work on as they normally would.

   For another example, the following command imports a directory,
treating files whose name ends in `.exe' as binary:

     cvs import -I ! -W "*.exe -k 'b'" first-dir vendortag reltag

The commit support files
========================

   The `-i' flag in the `modules' file can be used to run a certain
program whenever files are committed (*note modules::.).  The files
described in this section provide other, more flexible, ways to run
programs whenever something is committed.

   There are three kind of programs that can be run on commit.  They
are specified in files in the repository, as described below.  The
following table summarizes the file names and the purpose of the
corresponding programs.

`commitinfo'
     The program is responsible for checking that the commit is
     allowed.  If it exits with a non-zero exit status the commit will
     be aborted.

`verifymsg'
     The specified program is used to evaluate the log message, and
     possibly verify that it contains all required fields.  This is
     most useful in combination with the `rcsinfo' file, which can hold
     a log message template (*note rcsinfo::.).

`editinfo'
     The specified program is used to edit the log message, and
     possibly verify that it contains all required fields.  This is
     most useful in combination with the `rcsinfo' file, which can hold
     a log message template (*note rcsinfo::.).  (obsolete)

`loginfo'
     The specified program is called when the commit is complete.  It
     receives the log message and some additional information and can
     store the log message in a file, or mail it to appropriate
     persons, or maybe post it to a local newsgroup, or...  Your
     imagination is the limit!

The common syntax
-----------------

   The administrative files such as `commitinfo', `loginfo', `rcsinfo',
`verifymsg', etc., all have a common format.  The purpose of the files
are described later on.  The common syntax is described here.

   Each line contains the following:
   * A regular expression.  This is a basic regular expression in the
     syntax used by GNU emacs.

   * A whitespace separator--one or more spaces and/or tabs.

   * A file name or command-line template.

Blank lines are ignored.  Lines that start with the character `#' are
treated as comments.  Long lines unfortunately can *not* be broken in
two parts in any way.

   The first regular expression that matches the current directory name
in the repository is used.  The rest of the line is used as a file name
or command-line as appropriate.


File: cvs.info,  Node: commitinfo,  Next: verifymsg,  Prev: commit files,  Up: Administrative files

Commitinfo
==========

   The `commitinfo' file defines programs to execute whenever `cvs
commit' is about to execute.  These programs are used for pre-commit
checking to verify that the modified, added and removed files are really
ready to be committed.  This could be used, for instance, to verify
that the changed files conform to to your site's standards for coding
practice.

   As mentioned earlier, each line in the `commitinfo' file consists of
a regular expression and a command-line template.  The template can
include a program name and any number of arguments you wish to supply
to it.  The full path to the current source repository is appended to
the template, followed by the file names of any files involved in the
commit (added, removed, and modified files).

   The first line with a regular expression matching the relative path
to the module will be used.  If the command returns a non-zero exit
status the commit will be aborted.

   If the repository name does not match any of the regular expressions
in this file, the `DEFAULT' line is used, if it is specified.

   All occurances of the name `ALL' appearing as a regular expression
are used in addition to the first matching regular expression or the
name `DEFAULT'.

   Note: when CVS is accessing a remote repository, `commitinfo' will
be run on the *remote* (i.e., server) side, not the client side (*note
Remote repositories::.).


File: cvs.info,  Node: verifymsg,  Next: editinfo,  Prev: commitinfo,  Up: Administrative files

Verifying log messages
======================

   Once you have entered a log message, you can evaluate that message
to check for specific content, such as a bug ID.  Use the `verifymsg'
file to specify a program that is used to verify the log message.  This
program could be a simple script that checks that the entered message
contains the required fields.

   The `verifymsg' file is often most useful together with the
`rcsinfo' file, which can be used to specify a log message template.

   Each line in the `verifymsg' file consists of a regular expression
and a command-line template.  The template must include a program name,
and can include any number of arguments.  The full path to the current
log message template file is appended to the template.

   One thing that should be noted is that the `ALL' keyword is not
supported.  If more than one matching line is found, the first one is
used.  This can be useful for specifying a default verification script
in a module, and then overriding it in a subdirectory.

   If the repository name does not match any of the regular expressions
in this file, the `DEFAULT' line is used, if it is specified.

   If the verification script exits with a non-zero exit status, the
commit is aborted.

   Note that the verification script cannot change the log message; it
can merely accept it or reject it.

   The following is a little silly example of a `verifymsg' file,
together with the corresponding `rcsinfo' file, the log message
template and an verification  script.  We begin with the log message
template.  We want to always record a bug-id number on the first line
of the log message.  The rest of log message is free text.  The
following template is found in the file `/usr/cvssupport/tc.template'.

     BugId:

   The script `/usr/cvssupport/bugid.verify' is used to evaluate the
log message.

     #!/bin/sh
     #
     #       bugid.verify filename
     #
     #  Verify that the log message contains a valid bugid
     #  on the first line.
     #
     if head -1 < $1 | grep '^BugId:[ ]*[0-9][0-9]*$' > /dev/null; then
         exit 0
     else
         echo "No BugId found."
         exit 1
     fi

   The `verifymsg' file contains this line:

     ^tc     /usr/cvssupport/bugid.edit

   The `rcsinfo' file contains this line:

     ^tc     /usr/cvssupport/tc.template


File: cvs.info,  Node: editinfo,  Next: loginfo,  Prev: verifymsg,  Up: Administrative files

Editinfo
========

   *NOTE:* The `editinfo' feature has been rendered obsolete.  To set a
default editor for log messages use the `EDITOR' environment variable
(*note Environment variables::.) or the `-e' global option (*note
Global options::.).  See *Note verifymsg::, for information on the use
of the `verifymsg' feature for evaluating log messages.

   If you want to make sure that all log messages look the same way,
you can use the `editinfo' file to specify a program that is used to
edit the log message.  This program could be a custom-made editor that
always enforces a certain style of the log message, or maybe a simple
shell script that calls an editor, and checks that the entered message
contains the required fields.

   If no matching line is found in the `editinfo' file, the editor
specified in the environment variable `$CVSEDITOR' is used instead.  If
that variable is not set, then the environment variable `$EDITOR' is
used instead.  If that variable is not set a precompiled default,
normally `vi', will be used.

   The `editinfo' file is often most useful together with the `rcsinfo'
file, which can be used to specify a log message template.

   Each line in the `editinfo' file consists of a regular expression
and a command-line template.  The template must include a program name,
and can include any number of arguments.  The full path to the current
log message template file is appended to the template.

   One thing that should be noted is that the `ALL' keyword is not
supported.  If more than one matching line is found, the first one is
used.  This can be useful for specifying a default edit script in a
module, and then overriding it in a subdirectory.

   If the repository name does not match any of the regular expressions
in this file, the `DEFAULT' line is used, if it is specified.

   If the edit script exits with a non-zero exit status, the commit is
aborted.

   Note: when CVS is accessing a remote repository, or when the `-m' or
`-F' options to `cvs commit' are used, `editinfo' will not be consulted.
There is no good workaround for this; use `verifymsg' instead.

Editinfo example
----------------

   The following is a little silly example of a `editinfo' file,
together with the corresponding `rcsinfo' file, the log message
template and an editor script.  We begin with the log message template.
We want to always record a bug-id number on the first line of the log
message.  The rest of log message is free text.  The following template
is found in the file `/usr/cvssupport/tc.template'.

     BugId:

   The script `/usr/cvssupport/bugid.edit' is used to edit the log
message.

     #!/bin/sh
     #
     #       bugid.edit filename
     #
     #  Call $EDITOR on FILENAME, and verify that the
     #  resulting file contains a valid bugid on the first
     #  line.
     if [ "x$EDITOR" = "x" ]; then EDITOR=vi; fi
     if [ "x$CVSEDITOR" = "x" ]; then CVSEDITOR=$EDITOR; fi
     $CVSEDITOR $1
     until head -1|grep '^BugId:[ ]*[0-9][0-9]*$' < $1
     do  echo -n  "No BugId found.  Edit again? ([y]/n)"
         read ans
         case ${ans} in
             n*) exit 1;;
         esac
         $CVSEDITOR $1
     done

   The `editinfo' file contains this line:

     ^tc     /usr/cvssupport/bugid.edit

   The `rcsinfo' file contains this line:

     ^tc     /usr/cvssupport/tc.template


File: cvs.info,  Node: loginfo,  Next: rcsinfo,  Prev: editinfo,  Up: Administrative files

Loginfo
=======

   The `loginfo' file is used to control where `cvs commit' log
information is sent.  The first entry on a line is a regular expression
which is tested against the directory that the change is being made to,
relative to the `$CVSROOT'.  If a match is found, then the remainder of
the line is a filter program that should expect log information on its
standard input.

   If the repository name does not match any of the regular expressions
in this file, the `DEFAULT' line is used, if it is specified.

   All occurances of the name `ALL' appearing as a regular expression
are used in addition to the first matching regular expression or
`DEFAULT'.

   The first matching regular expression is used.

   *Note commit files::, for a description of the syntax of the
`loginfo' file.

   The user may specify a format string as part of the filter.  The
string is composed of a `%' followed by a space, or followed by a single
format character, or followed by a set of format characters surrounded
by `{' and `}' as separators.  The format characters are:

s
     file name

V
     old version number (pre-checkin)

v
     new version number (post-checkin)

   All other characters that appear in a format string expand to an
empty field (commas separating fields are still provided).

   For example, some valid format strings are `%', `%s', `%{s}', and
`%{sVv}'.

   The output will be a string of tokens separated by spaces.  For
backwards compatibility, the the first token will be the repository
name.  The rest of the tokens will be comma-delimited lists of the
information requested in the format string.  For example, if
`/u/src/master' is the repository, `%{sVv}' is the format string, and
three files (ChangeLog, Makefile, foo.c) were modified, the output
might be:

     /u/src/master ChangeLog,1.1,1.2 Makefile,1.3,1.4 foo.c,1.12,1.13

   As another example, `%{}' means that only the name of the repository
will be generated.

   Note: when CVS is accessing a remote repository, `loginfo' will be
run on the *remote* (i.e., server) side, not the client side (*note
Remote repositories::.).

Loginfo example
---------------

   The following `loginfo' file, together with the tiny shell-script
below, appends all log messages to the file
`$CVSROOT/CVSROOT/commitlog', and any commits to the administrative
files (inside the `CVSROOT' directory) are also logged in
`/usr/adm/cvsroot-log'.

     ALL             /usr/local/bin/cvs-log $CVSROOT/CVSROOT/commitlog
     ^CVSROOT        /usr/local/bin/cvs-log /usr/adm/cvsroot-log

   The shell-script `/usr/local/bin/cvs-log' looks like this:

     #!/bin/sh
     (echo "-----------------------------------------------------------------";
      echo -n $USER"  ";
      date;
      echo;
      sed '1s+'${CVSROOT}'++') >> $1

Keeping a checked out copy
--------------------------

   It is often useful to maintain a directory tree which contains files
which correspond to the latest version in the repository.  For example,
other developers might want to refer to the latest sources without
having to check them out, or you might be maintaining a web site with
CVS and want every checkin to cause the files used by the web server to
be updated.

   The way to do this is by having loginfo invoke `cvs update'.  Doing
so in the naive way will cause a problem with locks, so the `cvs update'
must be run in the background.  Here is an example (this should all be
on one line):

     ^cyclic-pages		(date; cat; (sleep 2; cd /u/www/local-docs;
      cvs -q update -d) &) >> $CVSROOT/CVSROOT/updatelog 2>&1

   This will cause checkins to repository directories starting with
`cyclic-pages' to update the checked out tree in `/u/www/local-docs'.


File: cvs.info,  Node: rcsinfo,  Next: cvsignore,  Prev: loginfo,  Up: Administrative files

Rcsinfo
=======

   The `rcsinfo' file can be used to specify a form to edit when
filling out the commit log.  The `rcsinfo' file has a syntax similar to
the `verifymsg', `commitinfo' and `loginfo' files.  *Note syntax::.
Unlike the other files the second part is *not* a command-line
template.  Instead, the part after the regular expression should be a
full pathname to a file containing the log message template.

   If the repository name does not match any of the regular expressions
in this file, the `DEFAULT' line is used, if it is specified.

   All occurances of the name `ALL' appearing as a regular expression
are used in addition to the first matching regular expression or
`DEFAULT'.

   The log message template will be used as a default log message.  If
you specify a log message with `cvs commit -m MESSAGE' or `cvs commit -f
FILE' that log message will override the template.

   *Note verifymsg::, for an example `rcsinfo' file.

   When CVS is accessing a remote repository, the contents of `rcsinfo'
at the time a directory is first checked out will specify a template
which does not then change.  If you edit `rcsinfo' or its templates,
you may need to check out a new working directory.

Ignoring files via cvsignore
============================

   There are certain file names that frequently occur inside your
working copy, but that you don't want to put under CVS control.
Examples are all the object files that you get while you compile your
sources.  Normally, when you run `cvs update', it prints a line for
each file it encounters that it doesn't know about (*note update
output::.).

   CVS has a list of files (or sh(1) file name patterns) that it should
ignore while running `update', `import' and `release'.  This list is
constructed in the following way.

   * The list is initialized to include certain file name patterns:
     names associated with CVS administration, or with other common
     source control systems; common names for patch files, object files,
     archive files, and editor backup files; and other names that are
     usually artifacts of assorted utilities.  Currently, the default
     list of ignored file name patterns is:

              RCS     SCCS    CVS     CVS.adm
              RCSLOG  cvslog.*
              tags    TAGS
              .make.state     .nse_depinfo
              *~      #*      .#*     ,*      _$*     *$
              *.old   *.bak   *.BAK   *.orig  *.rej   .del-*
              *.a     *.olb   *.o     *.obj   *.so    *.exe
              *.Z     *.elc   *.ln
              core

   * The per-repository list in `$CVSROOT/CVSROOT/cvsignore' is
     appended to the list, if that file exists.

   * The per-user list in `.cvsignore' in your home directory is
     appended to the list, if it exists.

   * Any entries in the environment variable `$CVSIGNORE' is appended
     to the list.

   * Any `-I' options given to CVS is appended.

   * As CVS traverses through your directories, the contents of any
     `.cvsignore' will be appended to the list.  The patterns found in
     `.cvsignore' are only valid for the directory that contains them,
     not for any sub-directories.

   In any of the 5 places listed above, a single exclamation mark (`!')
clears the ignore list.  This can be used if you want to store any file
which normally is ignored by CVS.

   Specifying `-I !' to `cvs import' will import everything, which is
generally what you want to do if you are importing files from a
pristine distribution or any other source which is known to not contain
any extraneous files.  However, looking at the rules above you will see
there is a fly in the ointment; if the distribution contains any
`.cvsignore' files, then the patterns from those files will be
processed even if `-I !' is specified.  The only workaround is to
remove the `.cvsignore' files in order to do the import.  Because this
is awkward, in the future `-I !' might be modified to override
`.cvsignore' files in each directory.


File: cvs.info,  Node: history file,  Next: Variables,  Prev: cvsignore,  Up: Administrative files

The history file
================

   The file `$CVSROOT/CVSROOT/history' is used to log information for
the `history' command (*note history::.).  This file must be created to
turn on logging.  This is done automatically if the `cvs init' command
is used to set up the repository (*note Creating a repository::.).

   The file format of the `history' file is documented only in comments
in the CVS source code, but generally programs should use the `cvs
history' command to access it anyway, in case the format changes with
future releases of CVS.


File: cvs.info,  Node: Variables,  Prev: history file,  Up: Administrative files

Expansions in administrative files
==================================

   Sometimes in writing an administrative file, you might want the file
to be able to know various things based on environment CVS is running
in.  There are several mechanisms to do that.

   To find the home directory of the user running CVS (from the `HOME'
environment variable), use `~' followed by `/' or the end of the line.
Likewise for the home directory of USER, use `~USER'.  These variables
are expanded on the server machine, and don't get any resonable
expansion if pserver (*note Password authenticated::.) is in used;
therefore user variables (see below) may be a better choice to
customize behavior based on the user running CVS.

   One may want to know about various pieces of information internal to
CVS.  A CVS internal variable has the syntax `${VARIABLE}', where
VARIABLE starts with a letter and consists of alphanumberic characters
and `_'.  If the character following VARIABLE is a non-alphanumeric
character other than `_', the `{' and `}' can be omitted.  The CVS
internal variables are:

`CVSROOT'
     This is the value of the CVS root in use.  *Note Repository::, for
     a description of the various ways to specify this.

`RCSBIN'
     This is the value CVS is using for where to find RCS binaries.
     *Note Global options::, for a description of how to specify this.

`CVSEDITOR'
`VISUAL'
`EDITOR'
     These all expand to the same value, which is the editor that CVS
     is using.  *Note Global options::, for how to specify this.

`USER'
     Username of the user running CVS (on the CVS server machine).

   If you want to pass a value to the administrative files which the
user that is running CVS can specify, use a user variable.  To expand a
user variable, the administrative file contains `${=VARIABLE}'.  To set
a user variable, specify the global option `-s' to CVS, with argument
`VARIABLE=VALUE'.  It may be particularly useful to specify this option
via `.cvsrc' (*note ~/.cvsrc::.).

   For example, if you want the administrative file to refer to a test
directory you might create a user variable `TESTDIR'.  Then if CVS is
invoked as `cvs -s TESTDIR=/work/local/tests', and the administrative
file contains `sh ${=TESTDIR}/runtests', then that string is expanded
to `sh /work/local/tests/runtests'.

   All other strings containing `$' are reserved; there is no way to
quote a `$' character so that `$' represents itself.

File: cvs.info,  Node: modules,  Next: Wrappers,  Up: Administrative files

The modules file
================

   The `modules' file records your definitions of names for collections
of source code.  CVS will use these definitions if you use CVS to
update the modules file (use normal commands like `add', `commit', etc).

   The `modules' file may contain blank lines and comments (lines
beginning with `#') as well as module definitions.  Long lines can be
continued on the next line by specifying a backslash (`\') as the last
character on the line.

   A module definition is a single line of the `modules' file, in
either of two formats.  In both cases, MNAME represents the symbolic
module name, and the remainder of the line is its definition.

`MNAME -a ALIASES...'
     This represents the simplest way of defining a module MNAME.  The
     `-a' flags the definition as a simple alias: CVS will treat any
     use of MNAME (as a command argument) as if the list of names
     ALIASES had been specified instead.  ALIASES may contain either
     other module names or paths.  When you use paths in aliases,
     `checkout' creates all intermediate directories in the working
     directory, just as if the path had been specified explicitly in
     the CVS arguments.

`MNAME [ options ] DIR [ FILES... ] [ &MODULE... ]'
     In the simplest case, this form of module definition reduces to
     `MNAME DIR'.  This defines all the files in directory DIR as
     module mname.  DIR is a relative path (from `$CVSROOT') to a
     directory of source in the source repository.  In this case, on
     checkout, a single directory called MNAME is created as a working
     directory; no intermediate directory levels are used by default,
     even if DIR was a path involving several directory levels.

     By explicitly specifying files in the module definition after DIR,
     you can select particular files from directory DIR.  The sample
     definition for `modules' is an example of a module defined with a
     single file from a particular directory.  Here is another example:

          m4test  unsupported/gnu/m4 foreach.m4 forloop.m4

     With this definition, executing `cvs checkout m4test' will create
     a single working directory `m4test' containing the two files
     listed, which both come from a common directory several levels deep
     in the CVS source repository.

     A module definition can refer to other modules by including
     `&MODULE' in its definition.  `checkout' creates a subdirectory
     for each such module, in the directory containing the module.  For
     example, if modules contains

          m4test &unsupported

     then a checkout will create an `m4test' directory which contains a
     directory called `unsupported', which in turns contains all the
     directories and files which live there.

    `-d NAME'
          Name the working directory something other than the module
          name.

    `-e PROG'
          Specify a program PROG to run whenever files in a module are
          exported.  PROG runs with a single argument, the module name.

    `-i PROG'
          Specify a program PROG to run whenever files in a module are
          committed.  PROG runs with a single argument, the full
          pathname of the affected directory in a source repository.
          The `commitinfo', `loginfo', and `verifymsg' files provide
          other ways to call a program on commit.

    `-o PROG'
          Specify a program PROG to run whenever files in a module are
          checked out.  PROG runs with a single argument, the module
          name.

    `-s STATUS'
          Assign a status to the module.  When the module file is
          printed with `cvs checkout -s' the modules are sorted
          according to primarily module status, and secondarily
          according to the module name.  This option has no other
          meaning.  You can use this option for several things besides
          status: for instance, list the person that is responsible for
          this module.

    `-t PROG'
          Specify a program PROG to run whenever files in a module are
          tagged with `rtag'.  PROG runs with two arguments: the module
          name and the symbolic tag specified to `rtag'.  There is no
          way to specify a program to run when `tag' is executed.

    `-u PROG'
          Specify a program PROG to run whenever `cvs update' is
          executed from the top-level directory of the checked-out
          module.  PROG runs with a single argument, the full path to
          the source repository for this module.

   Note that the `-t'/`-f' features do not conveniently handle one
portion of CVS's operation: determining when files are modified.  CVS
will still want a file (or directory) to exist, and it will use its
modification time to determine whether a file is modified.  If CVS
erroneously thinks a file is unmodified (for example, a directory is
unchanged but one of the files within it is changed), you can force it
to check in the file anyway by specifying the `-f' option to `cvs
commit' (*note commit options::.).

Reference manual for the Administrative files
*********************************************

   Inside the repository, in the directory `$CVSROOT/CVSROOT', there
are a number of supportive files for CVS.  You can use CVS in a limited
fashion without any of them, but if they are set up properly they can
help make life easier.  For a discussion of how to edit them, *Note

defines the modules inside the repository.

update options
--------------

   These standard options are available with `update' (*note Common
options::., for a complete description of them):

`-D date'
     Use the most recent revision no later than DATE.  This option is
     sticky, and implies `-P'.  See *Note Sticky tags::, for more
     information on sticky tags/dates.

`-f'
     Only useful with the `-D DATE' or `-r TAG' flags.  If no matching
     revision is found, retrieve the most recent revision (instead of
     ignoring the file).

`-k KFLAG'
     Process RCS keywords according to KFLAG.  See co(1).  This option
     is sticky; future updates of this file in this working directory
     will use the same KFLAG.  The `status' command can be viewed to
     see the sticky options.  See *Note Invoking CVS::, for more
     information on the `status' command.

`-l'
     Local; run only in current working directory.  *Note Recursive
     behavior::.

`-P'
     Prune empty directories.  See *Note Moving directories::.

`-p'
     Pipe files to the standard output.

`-R'
     Update directories recursively (default).  *Note Recursive
     behavior::.

`-r tag'
     Retrieve revision TAG.  This option is sticky, and implies `-P'.
     See *Note Sticky tags::, for more information on sticky tags/dates.

   These special options are also available with `update'.

`-A'
     Reset any sticky tags, dates, or `-k' options.  See *Note Sticky
     tags::, for more information on sticky tags/dates.

`-d'
     Create any directories that exist in the repository if they're
     missing from the working directory.  Normally, `update' acts only
     on directories and files that were already enrolled in your
     working directory.

     This is useful for updating directories that were created in the
     repository since the initial checkout; but it has an unfortunate
     side effect.  If you deliberately avoided certain directories in
     the repository when you created your working directory (either
     through use of a module name or by listing explicitly the files
     and directories you wanted on the command line), then updating
     with `-d' will create those directories, which may not be what you
     want.

`-I NAME'
     Ignore files whose names match NAME (in your working directory)
     during the update.  You can specify `-I' more than once on the
     command line to specify several files to ignore.  Use `-I !' to
     avoid ignoring any files at all.  *Note cvsignore::, for other
     ways to make CVS ignore some files.

`-WSPEC'
     Specify file names that should be filtered during update.  You can
     use this option repeatedly.

     SPEC can be a file name pattern of the same type that you can
     specify in the `.cvswrappers' file. *Note Wrappers::.

`-jREVISION'
     With two `-j' options, merge changes from the revision specified
     with the first `-j' option to the revision specified with the
     second `j' option, into the working directory.

     With one `-j' option, merge changes from the ancestor revision to
     the revision specified with the `-j' option, into the working
     directory.  The ancestor revision is the common ancestor of the
     revision which the working directory is based on, and the revision
     specified in the `-j' option.

     In addition, each -j option can contain an optional date
     specification which, when used with branches, can limit the chosen
     revision to one within a specific date.  An optional date is
     specified by adding a colon (:) to the tag:
     `-jSYMBOLIC_TAG:DATE_SPECIFIER'.

     *Note Merging::.


File: cvs.info,  Node: update output,  Prev: update options,  Up: update

update output
-------------

   `update' and `checkout' keep you informed of its progress by
printing a line for each file, preceded by one character indicating the
status of the file:

`U FILE'
     The file was brought up to date with respect to the repository.
     This is done for any file that exists in the repository but not in
     your source, and for files that you haven't changed but are not
     the most recent versions available in the repository.

`P FILE'
     Like `U', but the CVS server sends a patch instead of an entire
     file.  These two things accomplish the same thing.

`A FILE'
     The file has been added to your private copy of the sources, and
     will be added to the source repository when you run `commit' on
     the file.  This is a reminder to you that the file needs to be
     committed.

`R FILE'
     The file has been removed from your private copy of the sources,
     and will be removed from the source repository when you run
     `commit' on the file.  This is a reminder to you that the file
     needs to be committed.

`M FILE'
     The file is modified in  your  working  directory.

     `M' can indicate one of two states for a file you're working on:
     either there were no modifications to the same file in the
     repository, so that your file remains as you last saw it; or there
     were modifications in the repository as well as in your copy, but
     they were merged successfully, without conflict, in your working
     directory.

     CVS will print some messages if it merges your work, and a backup
     copy of your working file (as it looked before you ran `update')
     will be made.  The exact name of that file is printed while
     `update' runs.

`C FILE'
     A conflict was detected while trying to merge your changes to FILE
     with changes from the source repository.  FILE (the copy in your
     working directory) is now the output of the rcsmerge(1) command on
     the two revisions; an unmodified copy of your file is also in your
     working directory, with the name `.#FILE.REVISION' where REVISION
     is the RCS revision that your modified file started from.  Resolve
     the conflict as described in *Note Conflicts example:: (Note that
     some systems automatically purge files that begin with `.#' if
     they have not been accessed for a few days.  If you intend to keep
     a copy of your original file, it is a very good idea to rename
     it.)  Under VMS, the file name starts with `__' rather than `.#'.

`? FILE'
     FILE is in your working directory, but does not correspond to
     anything in the source repository, and is not in the list of files
     for CVS to ignore (see the description of the `-I' option, and
     *note cvsignore::.).

File: cvs.info,  Node: log options,  Next: log examples,  Up: log

log options
-----------

   By default, `log' prints all information that is available.  All
other options restrict the output.

`-b'
     Print information about the revisions on the default branch,
     normally the highest branch on the trunk.

`-d DATES'
     Print information about revisions with a checkin date/time in the
     range given by the semicolon-separated list of dates.  The date
     formats accepted are those accepted by the `-D' option to many
     other CVS commands (*note Common options::.).  Dates can be
     combined into ranges as follows:

    `D1<D2'
    `D2>D1'
          Select the revisions that were deposited between D1 and D2.

    `<D'
    `D>'
          Select all revisions dated D or earlier.

    `D<'
    `>D'
          Select all revisions dated D or later.

    `D'
          Select the single, latest revision dated D or earlier.

     The `>' or `<' characters may be followed by `=' to indicate an
     inclusive range rather than an exclusive one.

     Note that the separator is a semicolon (;).

`-h'
     Print only the name of the RCS file, name of the file in the
     working directory, head, default branch, access list, locks,
     symbolic names, and suffix.

`-l'
     Local; run only in current working directory.  (Default is to run
     recursively).

`-N'
     Do not print the list of tags for this file.  This option can be
     very useful when your site uses a lot of tags, so rather than
     "more"'ing over 3 pages of tag information, the log information is
     presented without tags at all.

`-R'
     Print only the name of the RCS file.

`-rREVISIONS'
     Print information about revisions given in the comma-separated
     list REVISIONS of revisions and ranges.  The following table
     explains the available range formats:

    `REV1:REV2'
          Revisions REV1 to REV2 (which must be on the same branch).

    `:REV'
          Revisions from the beginning of the branch up to and
          including REV.

    `REV:'
          Revisions starting with REV to the end of the branch
          containing REV.

    `BRANCH'
          An argument that is a branch means all revisions on that
          branch.

    `BRANCH1:BRANCH2'
          A range of branches means all revisions on the branches in
          that range.

    `BRANCH.'
          The latest revision in BRANCH.

     A bare `-r' with no revisions means the latest revision on the
     default branch, normally the trunk.  There can be no space between
     the `-r' option and its argument.

`-s STATES'
     Print information about revisions whose state attributes match one
     of the states given in the comma-separated list STATES.

`-t'
     Print the same as `-h', plus the descriptive text.

`-wLOGINS'
     Print information about revisions checked in by users with login
     names appearing in the comma-separated list LOGINS.  If LOGINS is
     omitted, the user's login is assumed.  There can be no space
     between the `-w' option and its argument.

   `log' prints the intersection of the revisions selected with the
options `-d', `-s', and `-w', intersected with the union of the
revisions selected by `-b' and `-r'.

rdiff--'patch' format diffs between releases
============================================

   * rdiff [-flags] [-V vn] [-r t|-D d [-r t2|-D d2]] modules...

   * Requires: repository.

   * Changes: nothing.

   * Synonym: patch

   Builds a Larry Wall format patch(1) file between two releases, that
can be fed directly into the `patch' program to bring an old release
up-to-date with the new release.  (This is one of the few CVS commands
that operates directly from the repository, and doesn't require a prior
checkout.) The diff output is sent to the standard output device.

   You can specify (using the standard `-r' and `-D' options) any
combination of one or two revisions or dates.  If only one revision or
date is specified, the patch file reflects differences between that
revision or date and the current head revisions in the RCS file.

   Note that if the software release affected is contained in more than
one directory, then it may be necessary to specify the `-p' option to
the `patch' command when patching the old sources, so that `patch' is
able to find the files that are located in other directories.

rdiff options
-------------

   These standard options are supported by `rdiff' (*note Common
options::., for a complete description of them):

`-D DATE'
     Use the most recent revision no later than DATE.

`-f'
     If no matching revision is found, retrieve the most recent
     revision (instead of ignoring the file).

`-l'
     Local; don't descend subdirectories.

`-R'
     Examine directories recursively.  This option is on by default.

`-r TAG'
     Use revision TAG.

   In addition to the above, these options are available:

`-c'
     Use the context diff format.  This is the default format.

`-s'
     Create a summary change report instead of a patch.  The summary
     includes information about files that were changed or added
     between the releases.  It is sent to the standard output device.
     This is useful for finding out, for example, which files have
     changed between two dates or revisions.

`-t'
     A diff of the top two revisions is sent to the standard output
     device.  This is most useful for seeing what the last change to a
     file was.

`-u'
     Use the unidiff format for the context diffs.  This option is not
     available if your `diff' does not support the unidiff format.
     Remember that old versions of the `patch' program can't handle the
     unidiff format, so if you plan to post this patch to the net you
     should probably not use `-u'.

`-V VN'
     Expand keywords according to the rules current in RCS version VN
     (the expansion format changed with RCS version 5).

   Suppose you receive mail from foo@@bar.com asking for an update from
release 1.2 to 1.4 of the tc compiler.  You have no such patches on
hand, but with CVS that can easily be fixed with a command such as this:

     $ cvs rdiff -c -r FOO1_2 -r FOO1_4 tc | \
     $$ Mail -s 'The patches you asked for' foo@@bar.com

   Suppose you have made release 1.3, and forked a branch called
`R_1_3fix' for bugfixes.  `R_1_3_1' corresponds to release 1.3.1, which
was made some time ago.  Now, you want to see how much development has
been done on the branch.  This command can be used:

     $ cvs patch -s -r R_1_3_1 -r R_1_3fix module-name
     cvs rdiff: Diffing module-name

release--Indicate that a Module is no longer in use
===================================================

   * release [-d] directories...

   * Requires: Working directory.

   * Changes: Working directory, history log.

   This command is meant to safely cancel the effect of `cvs checkout'.
Since CVS doesn't lock files, it isn't strictly necessary to use this
command.  You can always simply delete your working directory, if you
like; but you risk losing changes you may have forgotten, and you leave
no trace in the CVS history file (*note history file::.) that you've
abandoned your checkout.

   Use `cvs release' to avoid these problems.  This command checks that
no uncommitted changes are present; that you are executing it from
immediately above a CVS working directory; and that the repository
recorded for your files is the same as the repository defined in the
module database.

   If all these conditions are true, `cvs release' leaves a record of
its execution (attesting to your intentionally abandoning your
checkout) in the CVS history log.

release options
---------------

   The `release' command supports one command option:

`-d'
     Delete your working copy of the file if the release succeeds.  If
     this flag is not given your files will remain in your working
     directory.

     *Warning:*  The `release' command deletes all directories and
     files recursively.  This has the very serious side-effect that any
     directory that you have created inside your checked-out sources,
     and not added to the repository (using the `add' command; *note
     Adding files::.) will be silently deleted--even if it is non-empty!

release output
--------------

   Before `release' releases your sources it will print a one-line
message for any file that is not up-to-date.

   *Warning:*  Any new directories that you have created, but not added
to the CVS directory hierarchy with the `add' command (*note Adding
files::.) will be silently ignored (and deleted, if `-d' is specified),
even if they contain files.

`U FILE'
`P FILE'
     There exists a newer revision of this file in the repository, and
     you have not modified your local copy of the file (`U' and `P'
     mean the same thing).

`A FILE'
     The file has been added to your private copy of the sources, but
     has not yet been committed to the repository.  If you delete your
     copy of the sources this file will be lost.

`R FILE'
     The file has been removed from your private copy of the sources,
     but has not yet been removed from the repository, since you have
     not yet committed the removal.  *Note commit::.

`M FILE'
     The file is modified in your working directory.  There might also
     be a newer revision inside the repository.

`? FILE'
     FILE is in your working directory, but does not correspond to
     anything in the source repository, and is not in the list of files
     for CVS to ignore (see the description of the `-I' option, and
     *note cvsignore::.).  If you remove your working sources, this

====================================

   * rtag [-falnR] [-b] [-d] [-r tag | -Ddate] symbolic_tag modules...

   * Requires: repository.

   * Changes: repository.

   * Synonym: rfreeze

   You can use this command to assign symbolic tags to particular,
explicitly specified source revisions in the repository.  `rtag' works
directly on the repository contents (and requires no prior checkout).
Use `tag' instead (*note tag::.), to base the selection of revisions on
the contents of your working directory.

   If you attempt to use a tag name that already exists, CVS will
complain and not overwrite that tag.  Use the `-F' option to force the
new tag value.

File: cvs.info,  Node: rtag options,  Up: rtag

rtag options
------------

   These standard options are supported by `rtag' (*note Common
options::., for a complete description of them):

`-D DATE'
     Tag the most recent revision no later than DATE.

`-f'
     Only useful with the `-D DATE' or `-r TAG' flags.  If no matching
     revision is found, use the most recent revision (instead of
     ignoring the file).

`-F'
     Overwrite an existing tag of the same name on a different revision.

`-l'
     Local; run only in current working directory.

`-n'
     Do not run any tag program that was specified with the `-t' flag
     inside the `modules' file.  (*note modules::.).

`-R'
     Tag directories recursively.  This is on by default.

`-r TAG'
     Only tag those files that contain TAG.  This can be used to rename
     a tag: tag only the files identified by the old tag, then delete
     the old tag, leaving the new tag on exactly the same files as the
     old tag.

   In addition to the above common options, these options are available:

`-a'
     Use the `-a' option to have `rtag' look in the `Attic' (*note
     Attic::.) for removed files that contain the specified tag.  The
     tag is removed from these files, which makes it convenient to
     re-use a symbolic tag as development continues (and files get
     removed from the up-coming distribution).

`-b'
     Make the tag a branch tag.  *Note Branching and merging::.

`-d'
     Delete the tag instead of creating it.

     In general, tags (often the symbolic names of software
     distributions) should not be removed, but the `-d' option is
     available as a means to remove completely obsolete symbolic names
     if necessary (as might be the case for an Alpha release, or if you
     mistagged a module).

tag--Add a symbolic tag to checked out versions of files
========================================================

   * tag [-lR] [-b] [-c] [-d] symbolic_tag [files...]

   * Requires: working directory, repository.

   * Changes: repository.

   * Synonym: freeze

   Use this command to assign symbolic tags to the nearest repository
versions to your working sources.  The tags are applied immediately to
the repository, as with `rtag', but the versions are supplied
implicitly by the CVS records of your working files' history rather than
applied explicitly.

   One use for tags is to record a snapshot of the current sources when
the software freeze date of a project arrives.  As bugs are fixed after
the freeze date, only those changed sources that are to be part of the
release need be re-tagged.

   The symbolic tags are meant to permanently record which revisions of
which files were used in creating a software distribution.  The
`checkout' and `update' commands allow you to extract an exact copy of
a tagged release at any time in the future, regardless of whether files
have been changed, added, or removed since the release was tagged.

   This command can also be used to delete a symbolic tag, or to create
a branch.  See the options section below.

   If you attempt to use a tag name that already exists, CVS will
complain and not overwrite that tag.  Use the `-F' option to force the
new tag value.

`-l'
     Local; run only in current working directory.

`-R'
     Tag directories recursively.  This is on by default.

   Two special options are available:

`-b'
     Make the tag a branch tag (*note Branching and merging::.),
     allowing concurrent, isolated development.  This is most useful
     for creating a patch to a previously released software
     distribution.

`-c'
     Check that all files which are to be tagged are unmodified.  This
     can be used to make sure that you can reconstruct the current file
     contents.

`-d'
     Delete a tag.

     If you use `cvs tag -d symbolic_tag', the symbolic tag you specify
     is deleted instead of being added.  Warning: Be very certain of
     your ground before you delete a tag; doing this permanently
     discards some historical information, which may later turn out to
     be valuable.

   There are three basic types of modules: alias modules, regular
modules, and ampersand modules.  The difference between them is the way
that they map files in the repository to files in the working
directory.  In all of the following examples, the top-level repository
contains a directory called `first-dir', which contains two files,
`file1' and `file2', and a directory `sdir'.  `first-dir/sdir' contains
a file `sfile'.

Alias modules
-------------

   Alias modules are the simplest kind of module:
d874 282
a1155 1
   For example, if the modules file contains:
d1157 2
a1158 1
     amodule -a first-dir
d1160 2
a1161 1
then the following two commands are equivalent:
d1163 6
a1168 2
     $ cvs co amodule
     $ cvs co first-dir
d1170 1
a1170 1
and they each would provide output such as:
d1172 24
a1195 5
     cvs checkout: Updating first-dir
     U first-dir/file1
     U first-dir/file2
     cvs checkout: Updating first-dir/sdir
     U first-dir/sdir/sfile

Regular modules
---------------
d1238 2
a1239 8
`MNAME [ options ] DIR [ FILES... ]'
     In the simplest case, this form of module definition reduces to
     `MNAME DIR'.  This defines all the files in directory DIR as
     module mname.  DIR is a relative path (from `$CVSROOT') to a
     directory of source in the source repository.  In this case, on
     checkout, a single directory called MNAME is created as a working
     directory; no intermediate directory levels are used by default,
     even if DIR was a path involving several directory levels.
d1241 3
a1243 1
   For example, if a module is defined by:
d1245 1
a1245 1
     regmodule first-dir
d1247 1
a1247 1
then regmodule will contain the files from first-dir:
d1249 2
a1250 7
     $ cvs co regmodule
     cvs checkout: Updating regmodule
     U regmodule/file1
     U regmodule/file2
     cvs checkout: Updating regmodule/sdir
     U regmodule/sdir/sfile
     $
d1252 2
a1253 2
   By explicitly specifying files in the module definition after DIR,
you can select particular files from directory DIR.  Here is an example:
d1255 100
a1354 1
     regfiles first-dir/sdir sfile
d1356 1
a1356 3
With this definition, getting the regfiles module will create a single
working directory `regfiles' containing the file listed, which comes
from a directory deeper in the CVS source repository:
d1358 2
a1359 3
     $ cvs co regfiles
     U regfiles/sfile
     $

d1364 11
a1374 2
Ampersand modules
-----------------
d1376 1
a1376 33
   A module definition can refer to other modules by including
`&MODULE' in its definition.
     MNAME [ options ] &MODULE...

   Then getting the module creates a subdirectory for each such module,
in the directory containing the module.  For example, if modules
contains

     ampermod &first-dir

   then a checkout will create an `ampermod' directory which contains a
directory called `first-dir', which in turns contains all the
directories and files which live there.  For example, the command

     $ cvs co ampermod

will create the following files:

     ampermod/first-dir/file1
     ampermod/first-dir/file2
     ampermod/first-dir/sdir/sfile

   There is one quirk/bug: the messages that CVS prints omit the
`ampermod', and thus do not correctly display the location to which it
is checking out the files:

     $ cvs co ampermod
     cvs checkout: Updating first-dir
     U first-dir/file1
     U first-dir/file2
     cvs checkout: Updating first-dir/sdir
     U first-dir/sdir/sfile
     $
d1378 6
a1383 2
   Do not rely on this buggy behavior; it may get fixed in a future
release of CVS.

Excluding directories
---------------------

   An alias module may exclude particular directories from other
modules by using an exclamation mark (`!') before the name of each
directory to be excluded.

   For example, if the modules file contains:
d1403 2
a1404 1
     exmodule -a first-dir !first-dir/sdir
d1406 2
a1407 2

d1435 4
a1438 35
`-e PROG'
     Specify a program PROG to run whenever files in a module are
     exported.  PROG runs with a single argument, the module name.

`-i PROG'
     Specify a program PROG to run whenever files in a module are
     committed.  PROG runs with a single argument, the full pathname of
     the affected directory in a source repository.  The `commitinfo',
     `loginfo', and `verifymsg' files provide other ways to call a
     program on commit.

`-o PROG'
     Specify a program PROG to run whenever files in a module are
     checked out.  PROG runs with a single argument, the module name.

`-s STATUS'
     Assign a status to the module.  When the module file is printed
     with `cvs checkout -s' the modules are sorted according to
     primarily module status, and secondarily according to the module
     name.  This option has no other meaning.  You can use this option
     for several things besides status: for instance, list the person
     that is responsible for this module.

`-t PROG'
     Specify a program PROG to run whenever files in a module are
     tagged with `rtag'.  PROG runs with two arguments: the module name
     and the symbolic tag specified to `rtag'.  It is not run when
     `tag' is executed.  Generally you will find that taginfo is a
     better solution (*note user-defined logging::.).

`-u PROG'
     Specify a program PROG to run whenever `cvs update' is executed
     from the top-level directory of the checked-out module.  PROG runs
     with a single argument, the full path to the source repository for
     this module.

   There are the following additional special options.

`-b BRANCH'
     See *Note Multiple vendor branches::.

`-k SUBST'
     Indicate the keyword expansion mode desired.  This setting will
     apply to all files created during the import, but not to any files
     that previously existed in the repository.  See *Note Substitution
     modes::, for a list of valid `-k' settings.

`-I NAME'
     Specify file names that should be ignored during import.  You can
     use this option repeatedly.  To avoid ignoring any files at all
     (even those ignored by default), specify `-I !'.

     NAME can be a file name pattern of the same type that you can
     specify in the `.cvsignore' file.  *Note cvsignore::.

`-W SPEC'
     Specify file names that should be filtered during import.  You can
     use this option repeatedly.

     SPEC can be a file name pattern of the same type that you can
     specify in the `.cvswrappers' file. *Note Wrappers::.

-------------

   `import' keeps you informed of its progress by printing a line for
each file, preceded by one character indicating the status of the file:

`U FILE'
     The file already exists in the repository and has not been locally
     modified; a new revision has been created (if necessary).

`N FILE'
     The file is a new file which has been added to the repository.

`C FILE'
     The file already exists in the repository but has been locally
     modified; you will have to merge the changes.

`I FILE'
     The file is being ignored (*note cvsignore::.).

`L FILE'
     The file is a symbolic link; `cvs import' ignores symbolic links.
     People periodically suggest that this behavior should be changed,
     but if there is a consensus on what it should be changed to, it
     doesn't seem to be apparent.  (Various options in the `modules'

log--Print out log information for files
========================================

   * Synopsis: log [options] [files...]

   * Requires: repository, working directory.

   * Changes: nothing.

   Display log information for files.  `log' used to call the RCS
utility `rlog'.  Although this is no longer true in the current
sources, this history determines the format of the output and the
options, which are not quite in the style of the other CVS commands.

   The output includes the location of the RCS file, the "head"
revision (the latest revision on the trunk), all symbolic names (tags)
and some other things.  For each revision, the revision number, the
author, the number of lines added/deleted and the log message are
printed.  All times are displayed in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
(Other parts of CVS print times in the local timezone).

   *Warning:* `log' uses `-R' in a way that conflicts with the normal
use inside CVS (*note Common options::.).

diff--Show differences between revisions
========================================

   * Synopsis: diff [-lR] [format_options] [[-r rev1 | -D date1] [-r
     rev2 |  -D date2]] [files...]

   * Requires: working directory, repository.

   * Changes: nothing.

   The `diff' command is used to compare different revisions of files.
The default action is to compare your working files with the revisions
they were based on, and report any differences that are found.

   If any file names are given, only those files are compared.  If any
directories are given, all files under them will be compared.

   The exit status for diff is different than for other CVS commands;
for details *Note Exit status::.

File: cvs.info,  Node: diff options,  Next: diff examples,  Up: diff

diff options
------------

   These standard options are supported by `diff' (*note Common
options::., for a complete description of them):

`-D DATE'
     Use the most recent revision no later than DATE.  See `-r' for how
     this affects the comparison.

`-k KFLAG'
     Process keywords according to KFLAG.  See *Note Keyword
     substitution::.

`-l'
     Local; run only in current working directory.

`-R'
     Examine directories recursively.  This option is on by default.

`-r TAG'
     Compare with revision TAG.  Zero, one or two `-r' options can be
     present.  With no `-r' option, the working file will be compared
     with the revision it was based on.  With one `-r', that revision
     will be compared to your current working file.  With two `-r'
     options those two revisions will be compared (and your working
     file will not affect the outcome in any way).

     One or both `-r' options can be replaced by a `-D DATE' option,
     described above.

   The following options specify the format of the output.  They have
the same meaning as in GNU diff.

     -0 -1 -2 -3 -4 -5 -6 -7 -8 -9

   The following line produces a Unidiff (`-u' flag) between revision
1.14 and 1.19 of `backend.c'.  Due to the `-kk' flag no keywords are
substituted, so differences that only depend on keyword substitution
are ignored.

     $ cvs diff -kk -u -r 1.14 -r 1.19 backend.c

   Suppose the experimental branch EXPR1 was based on a set of files
tagged RELEASE_1_0.  To see what has happened on that branch, the
following can be used:

     $ cvs diff -r RELEASE_1_0 -r EXPR1

   A command like this can be used to produce a context diff between
two releases:

     $ cvs diff -c -r RELEASE_1_0 -r RELEASE_1_1 > diffs

   If you are maintaining ChangeLogs, a command like the following just
before you commit your changes may help you write the ChangeLog entry.
All local modifications that have not yet been committed will be
printed.

     $ cvs diff -u | less

export--Export sources from CVS, similar to checkout
====================================================

   * Synopsis: export [-flNnR] [-r rev|-D date] [-k subst] [-d dir]
     module...

   * Requires: repository.

   * Changes: current directory.

   This command is a variant of `checkout'; use it when you want a copy
of the source for module without the CVS administrative directories.
For example, you might use `export' to prepare source for shipment
off-site.  This command requires that you specify a date or tag (with
`-D' or `-r'), so that you can count on reproducing the source you ship
to others.

   One often would like to use `-kv' with `cvs export'.  This causes
any keywords to be expanded such that an import done at some other site
will not lose the keyword revision information.  But be aware that
doesn't handle an export containing binary files correctly.  Also be
aware that after having used `-kv', one can no longer use the `ident'
command (which is part of the RCS suite--see ident(1)) which looks for
keyword strings.  If you want to be able to use `ident' you must not
use `-kv'.

export options
--------------

   These standard options are supported by `export' (*note Common
options::., for a complete description of them):

`-D DATE'
     Use the most recent revision no later than DATE.

`-f'
     If no matching revision is found, retrieve the most recent
     revision (instead of ignoring the file).

`-l'
     Local; run only in current working directory.

`-n'
     Do not run any checkout program.

`-R'
     Export directories recursively.  This is on by default.

`-r TAG'
     Use revision TAG.

   In addition, these options (that are common to `checkout' and
`export') are also supported:

`-d DIR'
     Create a directory called DIR for the working files, instead of
     using the module name.  *Note checkout options::, for complete
     details on how CVS handles this flag.

`-k SUBST'
     Set keyword expansion mode (*note Substitution modes::.).

`-N'
     Only useful together with `-d DIR'.  *Note checkout options::, for
     complete details on how CVS handles this flag.


File: cvs.info,  Node: history,  Next: import,  Prev: export,  Up: CVS commands

history--Show status of files and users
=======================================

   * Synopsis:     history [-report] [-flags] [-options args] [files...]

   * Requires: the file `$CVSROOT/CVSROOT/history'

   * Changes: nothing.

   CVS can keep a history file that tracks each use of the `checkout',
`commit', `rtag', `update', and `release' commands.  You can use
`history' to display this information in various formats.

   Logging must be enabled by creating the file
`$CVSROOT/CVSROOT/history'.

   *Warning:* `history' uses `-f', `-l', `-n', and `-p' in ways that
conflict with the normal use inside CVS (*note Common options::.).

* Menu:

* history options::             history options


File: cvs.info,  Node: history options,  Up: history

history options
---------------

   Several options (shown above as `-report')  control  what kind of
report is generated:

`-c'
     Report on each time commit was used (i.e., each time the
     repository was modified).

`-e'
     Everything (all record types).  Equivalent to specifying `-x' with
     all record types.  Of course, `-e' will also include record types
     which are added in a future version of CVS; if you are writing a
     script which can only handle certain record types, you'll want to
     specify `-x'.

`-m MODULE'
     Report on a particular module.  (You can meaningfully use `-m'
     more than once on the command line.)

`-o'
     Report on checked-out modules.

`-T'
     Report on all tags.

`-x TYPE'
     Extract a particular set of record types TYPE from the CVS
     history.  The types are indicated by single letters, which you may
     specify in combination.

     Certain commands have a single record type:

    `F'
          release

    `O'
          checkout

    `E'
          export

    `T'
          rtag

     One of four record types may result from an update:

    `C'
          A merge was necessary but collisions were detected (requiring
          manual merging).

    `G'
          A merge was necessary and it succeeded.

    `U'
          A working file was copied from the repository.

    `W'
          The working copy of a file was deleted during update (because
          it was gone from the repository).

     One of three record types results from commit:

    `A'
          A file was added for the first time.

    `M'
          A file was modified.

    `R'
          A file was removed.

   The options shown as `-flags' constrain or expand the report without
requiring option arguments:

`-a'
     Show data for all users (the default is to show data only for the
     user executing `history').

`-l'
     Show last modification only.

`-w'
     Show only the records for modifications done from the same working
     directory where `history' is executing.

   The options shown as `-options ARGS' constrain the report based on
an argument:

`-b STR'
     Show data back to a record containing  the  string STR  in  either
     the module name, the file name, or the repository path.

`-D DATE'
     Show data since DATE.  This is slightly different from the normal
     use of `-D DATE', which selects the newest revision older than
     DATE.

`-p REPOSITORY'
     Show data for a particular source repository  (you can specify
     several `-p' options on the same command line).

`-r REV'
     Show records referring to revisions since the revision or tag
     named REV appears in individual RCS files.  Each RCS file is
     searched for the revision or tag.

`-t TAG'
     Show records since tag TAG was last added to the history file.
     This differs from the `-r' flag above in that it reads only the
     history file, not the RCS files, and is much faster.

`-u NAME'
     Show records for user NAME.


File: cvs.info,  Node: import,  Next: log,  Prev: history,  Up: CVS commands

import--Import sources into CVS, using vendor branches
======================================================

   * Synopsis: import [-options] repository vendortag releasetag...

   * Requires: Repository, source distribution directory.

   * Changes: repository.

   Use `import' to incorporate an entire source distribution from an
outside source (e.g., a source vendor) into your source repository
directory.  You can use this command both for initial creation of a
repository, and for wholesale updates to the module from the outside
source.  *Note Tracking sources::, for a discussion on this subject.

   The REPOSITORY argument gives a directory name (or a path to a
directory) under the CVS root directory for repositories; if the
directory did not exist, import creates it.

   When you use import for updates to source that has been modified in
your source repository (since a prior import), it will notify you of
any files that conflict in the two branches of development; use
`checkout -j' to reconcile the differences, as import instructs you to
do.

   If CVS decides a file should be ignored (*note cvsignore::.), it
does not import it and prints `I ' followed by the filename (*note
import output::., for a complete description of the output).

   If the file `$CVSROOT/CVSROOT/cvswrappers' exists, any file whose
names match the specifications in that file will be treated as packages
and the appropriate filtering will be performed on the file/directory
before being imported.  *Note Wrappers::.

   The outside source is saved in a first-level branch, by default
1.1.1.  Updates are leaves of this branch; for example, files from the
first imported collection of source will be revision 1.1.1.1, then
files from the first imported update will be revision 1.1.1.2, and so
on.

   At least three arguments are required.  REPOSITORY is needed to
identify the collection of source.  VENDORTAG is a tag for the entire
branch (e.g., for 1.1.1).  You must also specify at least one
RELEASETAG to identify the files at the leaves created each time you
execute `import'.

   Note that `import' does *not* change the directory in which you
invoke it.  In particular, it does not set up that directory as a CVS
working directory; if you want to work with the sources import them
first and then check them out into a different directory (*note Getting
the source::.).

     Use the unidiff format for the context diffs.  Remember that old
     versions of the `patch' program can't handle the unidiff format,

checkout options
----------------

   These standard options are supported by `checkout' (*note Common
options::., for a complete description of them):

`-D DATE'
     Use the most recent revision no later than DATE.  This option is
     sticky, and implies `-P'.  See *Note Sticky tags::, for more
     information on sticky tags/dates.

`-f'
     Only useful with the `-D DATE' or `-r TAG' flags.  If no matching
     revision is found, retrieve the most recent revision (instead of
     ignoring the file).

`-k KFLAG'
     Process keywords according to KFLAG.  See *Note Keyword
     substitution::.  This option is sticky; future updates of this
     file in this working directory will use the same KFLAG.  The
     `status' command can be viewed to see the sticky options.  See
     *Note Invoking CVS::, for more information on the `status' command.

`-l'
     Local; run only in current working directory.

`-n'
     Do not run any checkout program (as specified with the `-o' option
     in the modules file; *note modules::.).

`-P'
     Prune empty directories.  See *Note Moving directories::.

`-p'
     Pipe files to the standard output.

`-R'
     Checkout directories recursively.  This option is on by default.

`-r TAG'
     Use revision TAG.  This option is sticky, and implies `-P'.  See
     *Note Sticky tags::, for more information on sticky tags/dates.

   In addition to those, you can use these special command options with
`checkout':

`-A'
     Reset any sticky tags, dates, or `-k' options.  See *Note Sticky
     tags::, for more information on sticky tags/dates.

`-c'
     Copy the module file, sorted, to the standard output, instead of
     creating or modifying any files or directories in your working
     directory.

`-d DIR'
     Create a directory called DIR for the working files, instead of
     using the module name.  In general, using this flag is equivalent
     to using `mkdir DIR; cd DIR' followed by the checkout command
     without the `-d' flag.

     There is an important exception, however.  It is very convenient
     when checking out a single item to have the output appear in a
     directory that doesn't contain empty intermediate directories.  In
     this case _only_, CVS tries to "shorten" pathnames to avoid those
     empty directories.

     For example, given a module `foo' that contains the file `bar.c',
     the command `cvs co -d dir foo' will create directory `dir' and
     place `bar.c' inside.  Similarly, given a module `bar' which has
     subdirectory `baz' wherein there is a file `quux.c', the command
     `cvs -d dir co bar/baz' will create directory `dir' and place
     `quux.c' inside.

     Using the `-N' flag will defeat this behavior.  Given the same
     module definitions above, `cvs co -N -d dir foo' will create
     directories `dir/foo' and place `bar.c' inside, while `cvs co -N -d
     dir bar/baz' will create directories `dir/bar/baz' and place
     `quux.c' inside.

`-j TAG'
     With two `-j' options, merge changes from the revision specified
     with the first `-j' option to the revision specified with the
     second `j' option, into the working directory.

     With one `-j' option, merge changes from the ancestor revision to
     the revision specified with the `-j' option, into the working
     directory.  The ancestor revision is the common ancestor of the
     revision which the working directory is based on, and the revision
     specified in the `-j' option.

     In addition, each -j option can contain an optional date
     specification which, when used with branches, can limit the chosen
     revision to one within a specific date.  An optional date is
     specified by adding a colon (:) to the tag:
     `-jSYMBOLIC_TAG:DATE_SPECIFIER'.

     *Note Branching and merging::.

`-N'
     Only useful together with `-d DIR'.  With this option, CVS will
     not "shorten" module paths in your working directory when you
     check out a single module.  See the `-d' flag for examples and a
     discussion.

`-s'
     Like `-c', but include the status of all modules, and sort it by
     the status string.  *Note modules::, for info about the `-s'
     option that is used inside the modules file to set the module
     status.

commit--Check files into the repository
=======================================

   * Synopsis: commit [-lnRf] [-m 'log_message' | -F file] [-r
     revision] [files...]

   * Requires: working directory, repository.

   * Changes: repository.

   * Synonym: ci

   Use `commit' when you want to incorporate changes from your working
source files into the source repository.

   If you don't specify particular files to commit, all of the files in
your working current directory are examined.  `commit' is careful to
change in the repository only those files that you have really changed.
By default (or if you explicitly specify the `-R' option), files in
subdirectories are also examined and committed if they have changed;
you can use the `-l' option to limit `commit' to the current directory
only.

   `commit' verifies that the selected files are up to date with the
current revisions in the source repository; it will notify you, and
exit without committing, if any of the specified files must be made
current first with `update' (*note update::.).  `commit' does not call
the `update' command for you, but rather leaves that for you to do when
the time is right.

   When all is well, an editor is invoked to allow you to enter a log
message that will be written to one or more logging programs (*note
modules::., and *note loginfo::.)  and placed in the RCS file inside the
repository.  This log message can be retrieved with the `log' command;
see *Note log::.  You can specify the log message on the command line
with the `-m MESSAGE' option, and thus avoid the editor invocation, or
use the `-F FILE' option to specify that the argument file contains the
log message.

commit options
--------------

   These standard options are supported by `commit' (*note Common
options::., for a complete description of them):

`-l'
     Local; run only in current working directory.

`-n'
     Do not run any module program.

`-R'
     Commit directories recursively.  This is on by default.

`-r REVISION'
     Commit to REVISION.  REVISION must be either a branch, or a
     revision on the main trunk that is higher than any existing
     revision number (*note Assigning revisions::.).  You cannot commit
     to a specific revision on a branch.

   `commit' also supports these options:

`-F FILE'
     Read the log message from FILE, instead of invoking an editor.

`-f'
     Note that this is not the standard behavior of the `-f' option as
     defined in *Note Common options::.

     Force CVS to commit a new revision even if you haven't made any
     changes to the file.  If the current revision of FILE is 1.7, then
     the following two commands are equivalent:

          $ cvs commit -f FILE
          $ cvs commit -r 1.8 FILE

     The `-f' option disables recursion (i.e., it implies `-l').  To
     force CVS to commit a new revision for all files in all
     subdirectories, you must use `-f -R'.

`-m MESSAGE'
     Use MESSAGE as the log message, instead of invoking an editor.

Committing to a branch
......................

   You can commit to a branch revision (one that has an even number of
dots) with the `-r' option.  To create a branch revision, use the `-b'
option of the `rtag' or `tag' commands (*note Branching and
merging::.).  Then, either `checkout' or `update' can be used to base
your sources on the newly created branch.  From that point on, all
`commit' changes made within these working sources will be
automatically added to a branch revision, thereby not disturbing
main-line development in any way.  For example, if you had to create a
patch to the 1.2 version of the product, even though the 2.0 version is
already under development, you might do:

     $ cvs rtag -b -r FCS1_2 FCS1_2_Patch product_module
     $ cvs checkout -r FCS1_2_Patch product_module
     $ cd product_module
     [[ hack away ]]
     $ cvs commit

This works automatically since the `-r' option is sticky.

Creating the branch after editing
.................................

   Say you have been working on some extremely experimental software,
based on whatever revision you happened to checkout last week.  If
others in your group would like to work on this software with you, but
without disturbing main-line development, you could commit your change
to a new branch.  Others can then checkout your experimental stuff and
utilize the full benefit of CVS conflict resolution.  The scenario might
look like:

     [[ hacked sources are present ]]
     $ cvs tag -b EXPR1
     $ cvs update -r EXPR1
     $ cvs commit

   The `update' command will make the `-r EXPR1' option sticky on all
files.  Note that your changes to the files will never be removed by the
`update' command.  The `commit' will automatically commit to the
correct branch, because the `-r' is sticky.  You could also do like
this:

     [[ hacked sources are present ]]
     $ cvs tag -b EXPR1
     $ cvs commit -r EXPR1

but then, only those files that were changed by you will have the `-r
EXPR1' sticky flag.  If you hack away, and commit without specifying
the `-r EXPR1' flag, some files may accidentally end up on the main
trunk.

   To work with you on the experimental change, others would simply do

     $ cvs checkout -r EXPR1 whatever_module
