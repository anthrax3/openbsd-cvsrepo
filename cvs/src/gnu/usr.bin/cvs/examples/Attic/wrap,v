# This script is always called with the current directory set to
# where the file to be combined exists. but i may get called with a
# path to where cvs first started executing. (this probably should be
# fixed in cvs) so strip out all of the directory information. The
# first sed expression will only work if the path has a leading /
# if it doesn't the one in the if statement will work.
