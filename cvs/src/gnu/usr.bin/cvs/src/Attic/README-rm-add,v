@WHAT THE "DEATH SUPPORT" FEATURES DO:

(this really should be in the main manual, but noone has gotten around
to updating it).

CVS with death support can record when a file is active, or alive, and
when it is removed, or dead.  With this facility you can record the
history of a file, including the fact that at some point in its life
the file was removed and then later added.

First, the following now works as expected:

	touch foo
	cvs add foo ; cvs ci -m "added" foo
	rm foo
	cvs rm foo ; cvs ci -m "removed" foo
	touch foo
	cvs add foo ; cvs ci -m "resurrected" foo

Second, files can now be added or removed in a branch and later merged
into the trunk.

	cvs update -A
	touch a b c
	cvs add a b c ; cvs ci -m "added" a b c
	cvs tag -b branchtag
	cvs update -r branchtag
	touch d ; cvs add d
	rm a ; cvs rm a
	cvs ci -m "added d, removed a"
	cvs update -A
	cvs update -jbranchtag

Added and removed files may also be merged between branches.

Files removed in the trunk may be merged into branches.

Files added on the trunk are a special case.  They cannot be merged
into a branch.  Instead, simply branch the file by hand.

I also extended the "cvs update -j" semantic slightly.  Like before,
if you use two -j options, the changes made between the first and the
second will be merged into your working files.  This has not changed.

If you use only one -j option, it is used as the second -j option.
The first is assumed to be the greatest common ancestor revision
between the revision specified by the -j and the BASE revision of your
working file.
