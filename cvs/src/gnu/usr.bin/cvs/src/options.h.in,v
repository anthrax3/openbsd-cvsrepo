 * Normally, you can do this either via the -m flag on the command

 * logging templates (the rcsinfo file within the $CVSROOT/CVSROOT
 * directory), you might want to force people to use the editor even
 * if they specify a message with -m.  Enabling FORCE_USE_EDITOR will

 * When locking the repository, some sites like to remove locks and

 * existed for a long time.  This used to be the default for previous
 * versions of CVS.  CVS now attempts to be much more robust, so lock
 * files should not be left around by mistake. The new behaviour will
 * never remove old locks (they must now be removed by hand).
 * Enabling CVS_FUDGELOCKS will cause CVS to remove locks that are
 * older than CVSLCKAGE seconds.

 * doesn't try to guarantee that anyway.  The master server process
 * will monitor how far it is getting behind, if it reaches the high
 * water mark, it will signal the child process to stop generating
 * data when convenient (ie: no locks are held, currently at the
 * beginning of a new directory).  Once the buffer has drained
 * sufficiently to reach the low water mark, it will be signalled to
 * start again.  You may override the default hi/low watermarks here

   One security hole which has been reported is that setgid is not

   large enough to drive a truck through).  Don't assume that the
