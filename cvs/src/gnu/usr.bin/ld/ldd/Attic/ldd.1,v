.Sh NAME
.Nm ldd
.Nd list dynamic object dependencies
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm ldd
.Op Fl f Ar format
.Ar program ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
displays all shared objects that are needed to run the given program.
Contrary to
.Xr nm 1 ,
the list includes
.Dq indirect
dependencies that are the result of needed shared objects which themselves
depend on yet other shared objects.
Zero, one or two
.Fl f
options may be given. The argument is a format string passed to
.Xr ld.so 1
and allows customization of
.Nm ldd Ns 's
output. See
.Xr ld.so 1
for a list of recognised conversion characters.
.Pp
.Nm
also has some limited support for scanning shared libraries.
It displays dependencies, but does not hunt them down recursively.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr ld 1 ,
.Xr ld.so 1 ,
.Xr nm 1
.Sh HISTORY
A
.Nm ldd
utility first appeared in SunOS 4.0.
It appeared in its current form in
.Nx 0.9a .

@Let ldd scan shared libraries. Since it doesn't load them, it doesn't
use the hint cache nor anything, but at least it shows what dependencies
exist.
