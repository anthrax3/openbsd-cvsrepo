/* The data cache leads to incorrect results because it doesn't know about
   volatile variables, thus making it impossible to debug functions which
   use hardware registers.  Therefore it is #if 0'd out.  Effect on
   performance is some, for backtraces of functions with a few
   arguments each.  For functions with many arguments, the stack
   frames don't fit in the cache blocks, which makes the cache less
   helpful.  Disabling the cache is a big performance win for fetching
   large structures, because the cache code fetched data in 16-byte
   chunks.  */
