  <h1><em>URL Schemes Supported in Lynx</em></h1>

  <p><strong>Lynx</strong> handles a number of URL types, that are
  enumerated below. For more details about URLs (Uniform Resource
  Locators) see <em>RFC1738</em>:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><a href=
    "http://www.w3.org/Addressing/rfc1738.txt">http://www.w3.org/Addressing/rfc1738.txt</a></li>

    <li><a href=
    "ftp://ftp.rfc-editor.org/in-notes/rfc1738.txt">ftp://ftp.rfc-editor.org/in-notes/rfc1738.txt</a></li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Lynx</strong> resolves partial or relative URLs in
  documents with respect to the BASE if one was specified,
  otherwise with respect to the document's absolute URL, using the
  rules described in <em>RFC1808</em>:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><a href=
    "http://www.w3.org/Addressing/rfc1808.txt">http://www.w3.org/Addressing/rfc1808.txt</a></li>

    <li><a href=
    "ftp://ftp.rfc-editor.org/in-notes/rfc1808.txt">ftp://ftp.rfc-editor.org/in-notes/rfc1808.txt</a></li>
  </ul>

  <p>and in subsequent drafts of the <em>IETF</em>:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><a href=
    "https://web.archive.org/web/20130116065936/http://ftp.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/uri/">
    Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI) Working Group</a></li>
  </ul>

  <p>When entering a URL on the command line to be used as the
  <em>startfile</em>, or at the prompt for a '<em>g</em>'oto entry,
  a partial host field can be used and the scheme field can be
  omitted if the scheme and fully qualified domain name can be
  constructed internally by using the URL_DOMAIN_PREFIXES and
  URL_DOMAIN_SUFFIXES definitions in the <strong>Lynx</strong>
  configuration file. See the explanation of those definitions and
  their use in your <em>lynx.cfg</em>.</p>

  <p>For example, <em>wfbr</em> will be treated as
  <em>http://www.wfbr.edu/</em>, and <em>wfbr/dir/lynx</em> will be
  treated as <em>http://www.wfbr.edu/dir/lynx</em>, but
  <em>gopher.wfbr.edu/11/_fileserv/_lynx</em> will be treated as
  <em>gopher://gopher.wfbr.edu/11/_fileserv/_lynx</em>.</p>

  <p>For files or directories on the local host, a tilde
  (<em>~</em>) is expanded to the path of the account's login
  directory, e.g., <em>~/foo</em> will be expanded to
  <em>file://localhost/your/login/directory/foo</em>. The tilde
  expansion is done homologously on Unix and VMS.</p>

  <p>On VMS, <strong>Lynx</strong> also will expand any file or
  directory spec recognizable to DCL into a valid URL, e.g.,
  <em>[]</em> will be expanded to
  <em>file://localhost/current/default/directory</em>.</p>

  <p>These expansions are <em>SOLELY</em> for <em>startfile</em> or
  '<em>g</em>'oto entries! Any partial or relative URLs within HTML
  documents are resolved according to the rules specified in
  RFC1808 and subsequent IETF drafts.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="http_url" id="http_url">The <em>http</em> and
  <em>https</em> URLs:</a></h2>

  <p><strong>Lynx</strong> handles http URLs exactly as specified
  in RFC1738. The format is:</p>
  <pre>
      <em>http://host:port/path?searchpart#fragment</em>
</pre>

  <p>where <em>:port</em> is optional and defaults to <em>:80</em>,
  <em>/path</em> if present is a slash-separated series of symbolic
  elements, and <em>?searchpart</em> if present is the query for an
  ISINDEX search or the content of a FORM with METHOD="GET". The
  <em>#fragment</em> field if present indicates a location in the
  document to seek for display, based on a NAME-ed anchor or an ID
  attribute within the document, and is technically an instruction
  rather than part of the URL. <strong>Lynx</strong> will treat ID
  attributes as NAME-ed anchors for all tags in the BODY of a
  document which can correspond to positions in the rendering of
  the document.</p>

  <p>The https URL has the same format, but the default port is
  <em>:443</em>.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="telnet_url" id="telnet_url">The <em>telnet</em>,
  <em>tn3270</em>, and <em>rlogin</em> URLs:</a></h2>

  <p>A <em>telnet</em> URL generally results in
  <strong>Lynx</strong> spawning a telnet session.
  <strong>Lynx</strong> implements the complete telnet URL scheme,
  i.e.:</p>
  <pre>
      <em>telnet://user:password@@host:port</em>
</pre>

  <p>The <em>user</em> and/or <em>:password</em> fields may be
  omitted, and the <em>@@</em> should be omitted if neither is
  present. The port defaults to <em>:23</em> when omitted in the
  URL.</p>

  <p>A <em>tn3270</em> or <em>rlogin</em> URL is specified
  equivalently, and similarly spawns a tn3270 or rlogin session.
  The actual behavior is dependent on the TCP-IP software installed
  on the local and target hosts.</p>

  <p>It is unwise to include the <em>:password</em> field except
  for URLs which point to anonymous or other public access
  accounts, and for most TCP-IP software you will be prompted for a
  password whether or not one was included in the URL.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="gopher_url" id="gopher_url">The <em>gopher</em>
  URL:</a></h2>

  <p>The gopher URL takes the form:</p>
  <pre>
      <em>gopher://host:port/gopher-path</em>
</pre>

  <p>where <em>:port</em> is optional and defaults to <em>:70</em>,
  and the <em>/gopher-path</em> is opaque (not fully equivalent to
  the slash-separated series of symbolic elements of http paths) as
  explained in RFC1738. Typically, the gopher-path consists of a
  <a href=
  "keystrokes/gopher_types_help.html"><em>gophertype</em></a>
  indicating the file or service type (e.g., <em>0</em> or
  <em>I</em> for plain text or an image, respectively, <em>7</em>
  for a search, or <em>1</em> for a directory), followed by a
  platform-specific <em>selector</em>. Any reserved characters in
  the selector should be hex escaped (<em>%hh</em>), including
  slashes, although hex escaping of slashes is not required by
  <strong>Lynx</strong> in gopher URLs.</p>

  <p><strong>Lynx</strong> does not overtly support the gopher+
  protocol, and does not represent itself as gopher+ capable when
  communicating with gopher servers. <strong>Lynx</strong> might
  transmit any (hex-escaped-tab-separated) extended gopher+ fields
  in a URL if an author included them in a document, but is likely
  to mishandle what the gopher server returns in such cases, and
  would not generate and transmit them itself. For pre-formed URLs
  to submit gopher searches, it may be better to use a <em>?</em>
  rather than hex-escaped tab (<em>%09</em>) as the separator for
  the <em>searchpart</em> in the <em>selector</em>, e.g.:<br>
  <em>gopher://gopher.wfbr.edu/77/_shell/search.shell%20/_shell/walker?lynx*</em>
  <strong>Lynx</strong> will handle the <em>%09</em> if you use
  that instead of <em>?</em>, but other WWW clients may mishandle
  it.</p>

  <p>For the <em>gophertype</em> which signifies HTML (<em>h</em>),
  if the <em>selector</em> begins with <em>GET%20/</em>
  <strong>Lynx</strong> will convert the gopher URL to an http URL,
  e.g.:<br></p>
  <pre>
<em>gopher://www.wfbr.edu:80/hGET%20/</em>
</pre>

  <p>will become:<br></p>
  <pre>
<em>http://www.wfbr.edu/</em>
</pre>

  <p>The port field will be retained if it is not <em>:80</em>, and
  will default to <em>:70</em> if it was defaulted originally.
  These conventions were adopted during development of the
  University of Minnesota gopher software to facilitate the
  offering of links to MIME-capable http servers in the listings
  returned by gopher servers, but should be considered Lynxisms and
  UMN Gopherisms.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="file_url" id="file_url">The <em>file</em>
  URL:</a></h2>

  <p>The file URL is used to retrieve files or generate a directory
  listing on the local host. The host field can be
  <em>localhost</em> or a domain name for the local host:<br></p>
  <pre>
<em>file://localhost/path</em>
</pre>

  <p>If you do not use <em>localhost</em> or a domain name for the
  local host, <strong>Lynx</strong> will substitute <em>ftp://</em>
  for <em>file://</em> and treat it as an ftp URL.</p>

  <p>The <em>/path</em> is treated as originating at the root,
  unless you include a tilde (<em>~</em>), e.g.:</p>
  <pre>
      <em>file://localhost/~/foo</em>   will be converted to:
      <em>file://localhost/your/login/directory/foo</em>
</pre>

  <p>The latter feature is a Lynxism, is done homologously on Unix
  and VMS, and should be used ONLY in local documents intended for
  <strong>Lynx</strong>.</p>

  <p>On VMS, the first element of the path, if not a tilde, is
  assumed to be a device, e.g.:</p>
  <pre>
      <em>file://localhost/www_root/directory/filename.suffix</em>
</pre>

  <p>should be used for:
  <em>www_root:[directory]filename.suffix</em><br>
  If you are unsure how to specify a file URL in local documents on
  VMS, invoke <strong>Lynx</strong> with the desired file or
  directory as the <em>startfile</em> using any spec acceptable to
  DCL, and then use the <em>showinfo</em> command (<em>=</em>) to
  see the file URL which <strong>Lynx</strong> created for it.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ftp_url" id="ftp_url">The <em>ftp</em> URL:</a></h2>

  <p>The ftp URL has the general format:</p>
  <pre>
      <em>ftp://host:port/path;type=[D,I, or A]</em>
      <em>ftp://username@@host:port/path;type=[D,I, or A]</em>
</pre>

  <p>The default port is <em>:21</em> and the default
  <em>username</em> is <em>anonymous</em>. If <em>username</em> is
  included, <strong>Lynx</strong> will prompt you for the password.
  For anonymous ftp, <strong>Lynx</strong> uses your
  <em>personal_mail_address</em> (user@@host) as the
  <em>password</em> if it has been defined via the
  '<em>o</em>'ptions menu. Otherwise, <strong>Lynx</strong> uses
  the dummy password <em>WWWUser</em>. (A password can also be
  embedded in the URL, by replacing <em>username</em> with
  <em>username:password</em>. This is strongly discouraged for
  'real' passwords that must be kept secret, since URLs with the
  completely unencrypted <em>password</em> may show up on the
  screen, in HISTORY and LIST pages etc., and may even become
  visible to remote sites for example through Referer headers.) Do
  not include the <em>@@</em> if neither <em>username</em> nor
  <em>:password</em> is included.</p>

  <p>The <em>;type=</em> parameter can be used with value
  <em>D</em>, <em>I</em>, or <em>A</em> to force handling of the
  URL as, respectively, a directory listing, binary file, or ASCII
  file. The <strong>Lynx</strong> ftp gateway normally determines
  this itself, but the parameter can be used if the internal
  procedure draws an incorrect inference about the nature of the
  ftp URL.</p>

  <p>The <em>/path</em> is treated according to RFC1738 for VMS and
  VM/CMS ftp servers. The lead slash (<em>/</em>) is treated purely
  as a separator, not as a designator for the root, and the
  <em>path</em> string if present is treated as in or under the
  login directory. For VMS ftp servers, if you wish to have the
  first element treated as a device rather than file or
  subdirectory name, begin it with a hex-escaped slash
  (<em>%2f</em>), e.g.:</p>
  <pre>
      <em>ftp://user@@myhost/%2fsys$common/syshlp</em>
</pre>

  <p>can be used for a listing of sys$common:[syshlp]<br>
  Also, on VM/CMS ftp servers, if the <em>path</em> string begins
  with <em>vmsysu%3a</em> it receives special handling as an SFS
  path, e.g.:</p>
  <pre>
      <em>ftp://ubvm.cc.buffalo.edu/vmsysu%3alistserv.webshare</em>
</pre>

  <p>For Unix and Unix-emulation ftp servers, RFC1738 is not
  respected and the lead slash is treated as the root, i.e., the
  <em>/path</em> is handled equivalently to that in file URLs. The
  distinction is irrelevant for anonymous ftp, but matters when
  using ftp for non-anonymous accounts. If you are using ftp with a
  Unix server and do wish to get a listing of the login directory
  or have the <em>path</em> string treated as a file or path under
  the login directory, include a tilde (<em>~</em>) as for <a href=
  "#file_url">file</a> URLs, e.g.:</p>
  <pre>
      <em>ftp://user@@myhost/~</em>
</pre>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="wais_url" id="wais_url">The <em>wais</em>
  URL:</a></h2>

  <p>The wais URL is used to retrieve resources using the Wide Area
  Information System protocol. The format is:</p>
  <pre>
      <em>wais://host:port/database</em>
      <em>wais://host:port/database?wais_query</em>
      <em>wais://host:port/database/wais_type/wais_path</em>
</pre>

  <p>where <em>:port</em> defaults to <em>:210</em></p>

  <p>Direct wais support is built into <strong>Lynx</strong> for
  VMS, and can be compiled into <strong>Lynx</strong> on Unix.</p>

  <p>If only a <em>database</em> is indicated in the URL,
  <strong>Lynx</strong> returns an ISINDEX cover page for searching
  that <em>database</em>, and will submit your search with the
  <em>wais_query</em> appended. <strong>Lynx</strong> will convert
  the server's reply into a hit list with URLs that include the
  <em>wais_type</em> and <em>wais_path</em> for retrieving items
  from the hit list.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="news_url" id="news_url">The <em>news</em>,
  <em>nntp</em>, and <em>snews</em> URLs:</a></h2>

  <p>The news and nntp URLs are handled by <strong>Lynx</strong> as
  specified in RFC1738, but for compatibility with other clients,
  <strong>Lynx</strong> allows inclusion of host and port fields in
  news URLs, which properly should be used <em>only</em> in nntp
  and snews URLs. If not included in news URLs,
  <strong>Lynx</strong> will use the nntp server pointed to by the
  NNTPSERVER environment variable or configuration symbol (see
  lynx.cfg), with default port <em>:119</em>. A host field must be
  included in nntp URLs, and the port field is optional with the
  same default.</p>

  <p>If the URL requires authentication, <strong>Lynx</strong> will
  prompt you for the username and password. These are cached during
  a session, for reuse on the same host. If $HOME/.newsauth exists,
  <strong>Lynx</strong> initializes its cache from this file. The
  .newsauth file contents are one line per entry: hostname,
  password and username (in that order) separated by a space.</p>

  <p>The formats are:<br></p>
  <pre>
      <em>news:newsgroup</em> (retrieves list of messages in newsgroup)
      <em>news:messageID</em> (retrieves the message)
      <em>news:*</em> (retrieves list of all available newsgroups)
      <em>nntp://host:port/newsgroup</em>
      <em>nntp://host:port/messageID</em>
      <em>nntp://host:port/*</em>
</pre>

  <p>(snews same as nntp, but the default port is
  <em>:563</em>)</p>

  <p>The <em>messageID</em> is the message's unique identifier,
  consisting of an identification string and the host of origin for
  the message (<em>ident_string@@origin_host</em>).</p>

  <p><strong>Lynx</strong> also supports wildcarding via an
  asterisk for listings of news hierarchies or sub-hierarchies,
  e.g.:</p>
  <pre>
      <em>news:comp.infosystems.*</em>
      <em>nntp://host:port/comp.infosystems.*</em>
</pre>

  <p>(snews same as nntp, but the default port is
  <em>:563</em>)<br>
  This is not in RFC1738 and may not be supported by all other
  clients.</p>

  <p><strong>Lynx</strong> allows you both to <em>reply</em> to the
  author of a news message via email, and, if news posting has been
  enabled, to send a <em>followup</em> message to the newsgroup
  (see <a href="#newspost_url">newspost, newsreply, snewspost,
  snewsreply</a>).</p>

  <p><strong>Lynx</strong> converts any strings in news messages
  which appear to be a URL with a supported scheme into a link for
  accessing that URL.</p>

  <p><strong>Lynx</strong> also supports the newsgroup and message
  number URL scheme:<br></p>
  <pre>
      <em>news:newsgroup/startNo-endNo</em> (lists message range in newsgroup)
      <em>news:newsgroup/messageNo</em>     (retrieves the message by number)
      <em>nntp://host:port/newsgroup/startNo-endNo</em>
      <em>nntp://host:port/newsgroup/messageNo</em>
</pre>

  <p>(snews same as nntp, but the default port is
  <em>:563</em>)<br>
  Use of this scheme is not recommended, because the message
  numbers are specific to each nntp server, unlike the unique
  identifiers for news messages.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="newspost_url" id="newspost_url">The
  <em>newspost</em>, <em>newsreply</em>, <em>snewspost</em>, and
  <em>snewsreply</em> URLs:</a></h2>

  <p>When <strong>Lynx</strong> receives group listings or articles
  via <em>news</em>, <em>nntp</em> or <em>snews</em> URLs, it also
  checks whether the nntp server supports posting from the
  <strong>Lynx</strong> user's site, and if so, includes links for
  posting new messages to that server, or for posting followups
  (replies) to previously posted messages. RFC1738, and IETF URL
  drafts through this release of <strong>Lynx</strong>, do not
  include any schemes for posting to news groups.
  <strong>Lynx</strong> has long supported newspost and newreply
  URL schemes for posting new messages or sending followups,
  respectively, to standard nntp servers, with default port
  <em>:119</em>. <strong>Lynx</strong> now also supports homologous
  snewspost and snewsreply URLs for use with SSL capable nntp
  servers.</p>

  <p>The formats are:</p>
  <pre>
      <em>newspost://host:port/newsgroup(s)</em>  (post a new message)
      <em>newsreply://host:port/newsgroup(s)</em> (post a followup message)
</pre>

  <p>(snewspost and snewsreply have the same formats, but the
  default port is <em>:563</em>)</p>

  <p>If the host field is omitted, it defaults to that pointed to
  by the NNTPSERVER configuration or environmental variable.
  Inclusion of at least one newsgroup in the URL is required, and
  additional groups can be specified as a comma-separated list.
  Wildcarding of newsgroup names is not supported for these URLs.
  For newsreply and snewsreply URLs, if an external editor has been
  defined via the <em>Options Menu</em>, the user is offered an
  option to include the currently displayed document, which
  presumably is a news article with a <em>followup</em> link that
  was activated, and if confirmed, each line of that document is
  prefixed with a right-angle-bracket. The user is expected to edit
  such an inclusion so that only the passages relevant to the
  followup message are retained.</p>

  <p>These URLs can be used as command line startfiles (in which
  case, <strong>Lynx</strong> will exit after posting the message,
  and the newreply or snewsreply URLs degrade to newspost or
  snewpost URLs, respectively). They also can be used as HREF
  attribute values in any HTML document homologously to <a href=
  "#mailto_url">mailto</a> URLs, with the qualification that they
  presently are supported only by <strong>Lynx</strong>.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="mailto_url" id="mailto_url">The <em>mailto</em>
  URL:</a></h2>

  <p>The mailto URL is used to provide links that when activated
  can be used to send a comment or the content of a FORM to an
  Internet email address (user@@host). The format is:</p>
  <pre>
      <em>mailto:user@@host</em>
</pre>

  <p>The description of the mailto URL in RFC1738 has been
  interpreted by some as allowing only a single recipient, but
  <strong>Lynx</strong> invented the mailto URL, has always
  supported a series of user@@host addresses as a comma-separated
  list, and still does. For compatibility with Explorer,
  <strong>Lynx</strong> also accepts a semi-colon-separated
  list.</p>

  <p>For compatibility with Netscape, <strong>Lynx</strong> parses
  any <em>?subject=The%20Subject</em> appended to the URL, trims
  the URL at the <em>?</em>, and uses the value as the default
  Subject: for the message or FORM content mailing. This is not
  recommended practice. The preferred way to indicate the default
  Subject: for a LINK or Anchor with a mailto HREF, or a FORM with
  a mailto ACTION, is via a TITLE attribute with the subject string
  as its value, e.g.:</p>
  <pre>
      <em>&lt;LINK REV="made"
            HREF="mailto:me@@myhost,her@@herhost" TITLE="The Subject"&gt;</em>

      <em>&lt;A HREF="mailto:user@@host" TITLE="The Subject"&gt;...&lt;/A&gt;</em>

      <em>&lt;FORM METHOD="post" ENCTYPE="text/plain"
            ACTION="mailto:WebMaster@@host" TITLE="The Subject"&gt;
       ...
      &lt;/FORM&gt;</em>
</pre>

  <p>Note that a TITLE attribute for FORM is now included in the
  HTML specifications. Some clients use a SUBJECT attribute for
  this purpose in FORM tags, and <strong>Lynx</strong> recognizes
  that as a synonym for TITLE.</p>

  <p><strong>Lynx</strong> also will process any
  <em>to=address(es)</em>, <em>cc=address(es)</em>,
  <em>keywords=word_list</em> and/or <em>body=message</em> fields
  in <em>?searchpart</em> tack-ons to mailto URLs. The <em>to</em>
  and/or <em>cc</em> values can be single addresses, or comma- or
  semi-colon-separated lists of addresses. All addresses, and any
  <em>body</em> values, will be offered for approval by the user
  before proceeding with a mailing. Any other name=value pairs in
  the <em>?searchpart</em> will be ignored. Also, if the mailto URL
  is the ACTION for a FORM, any <em>body</em> in a
  <em>?searchpart</em> tack-on will be ignored, because the body of
  the mailing must be constructed solely from the the FORM's
  content. <strong>Lynx</strong> expects multiple name=value pairs
  in a <em>?searchpart</em> tack-on to be separated by ampersands,
  as in the original Netscape implementation, and in an equally
  ill-advised IETF draft of that implementation (<a href=
  "ftp://ftp.isi.edu/internet-drafts/draft-hoffman-mailto-url-03.txt">draft-hoffman-mailto-url-03.txt</a>).
  These should be represented as entities (<em>&amp;amp;</em>) in
  the HTML markup. This functionality is generally desired, but the
  IETF backward compatibility principal normally would lead to a
  new scheme being used (e.g., <em>mail:</em>, or <em>smtp:</em>),
  rather than breaking <em>mailto:</em> implementations.</p>

  <p>If <em>ENCTYPE="text/plain"</em> is specified for a FORM with
  a mailto ACTION, <strong>Lynx</strong> will not hex escape the
  name=value pairs of the FORM's content, and will use physical
  newlines instead of '<em>&amp;</em>' or '<em>;</em>' to separate
  the pairs, so that the content will be readable directly.
  Otherwise, <strong>Lynx</strong> will mail the content with the
  default:</p>
  <pre>
      <em>ENCTYPE="application/x-www-form-urlencoded"</em> ('<em>&amp;</em>' separates pairs)
</pre>

  <p>or:</p>
  <pre>
      <em>ENCTYPE="application/sgml-form-urlencoded"</em> ('<em>;</em>' separates pairs)
</pre>

  <p>if the latter was indicated.</p>

  <p>Note that when mailing FORM content <strong>Lynx</strong>
  wraps any lines longer than 78 characters, to avoid buffer
  overflows in mail software and to ensure reliable transmission
  across gateways. If the ENCTYPE was not <em>text/plain</em>, any
  script which decodes the mailed content should ignore the
  physical newlines and recognize only hex escaped newline
  characters as intended to be present in the decoded content.</p>

  <p>If the mailto URL is not the ACTION for a FORM, and if an
  external editor has been defined via the <em>Options Menu</em>,
  the user is offered an option to include the currently displayed
  document. If this option is accepted, each line of that document
  is prefixed with a right-angle-bracket, and the prefixed
  inclusion should be trimmed by the user to just those passages
  relevant to the message which will be sent.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="finger_url" id="finger_url">The <em>finger</em>
  URL:</a></h2>

  <p><strong>Lynx</strong> has full support for the finger
  protocol, but a format for finger URLs has not yet been adopted
  by the IETF. The formats supported by <strong>Lynx</strong>
  therefore include every possibility not inconsistent with
  RFC1738, including:</p>
  <pre>
      finger://host                         finger://@@host
      finger://host/                        finger://@@host/
      finger://host/%2fw                    finger://@@host/w
      finger://host/w                       finger://host/w/
      finger://host/username[@@host]         finger://username@@host
      finger://host/username[@@host]/        finger://username@@host/
      finger://host/w/username[@@host]       finger://username@@host/w
      finger://host/%2fw%20username[@@host]  finger://host/username[@@host]/w
      finger://host/w/username
</pre>

  <p>Activating a finger URL will send a request to the finger
  server via port 79 on the host specified. You can include
  <em>:79</em> in the URL, but no other value is allowed. The
  <em>/w</em> or <em>/%2fw</em> is used to request a full report
  for finger servers which support it, and is not case sensitive
  (i.e., can be <em>/W</em> or <em>/%2fW</em>). Any strings in the
  report which appear to be a URL with a supported scheme will be
  converted into a link for accessing that URL.</p>

  <p>An alternative way to access finger servers is via gopher URLs
  with port 79 and the plain text (<em>0</em>) <em>gophertype</em>
  specified:<br>
  <em>gopher://host:79/0</em><br>
  <strong>Lynx</strong> will handle such URLs equivalently to overt
  finger URLs, including creation of links for any strings which
  appear to be supported URLs.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="cso_url" id="cso_url">The <em>cso</em> URL:</a></h2>

  <p>The cso URL is intended to provide a gateway to CSO/PH (QI)
  servers. The requests are made on port 105 by default
  (<em>:105</em>), with the following overt cso URL format:<br></p>
  <pre>
      <em>cso://host</em>
</pre>

  <p>You also can use a gopher URL format with port 105 and the CSO
  (<em>2</em>) <em>gophertype</em> specified:</p>
  <pre>
      <em>gopher://host:105/2</em>
</pre>

  <p><strong>Lynx</strong> will parse the stream returned by the
  server for the above URLs and create a FORM for submitting
  additional requests (searches) to the server. Any strings in the
  reports returned for these requests (searches) which appear to be
  a URL with a supported scheme will be converted into a link for
  accessing that URL.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="bibp_url" id="bibp_url">The <em>bibp</em>
  URL:</a></h2>

  <p><strong>Lynx</strong> provides built-in support for
  bibliographic protocol (BibP). BibP links are links to published
  works such as books or journal articles, without a predefined
  server. BibP links are intended for resolution by a local bibhost
  server (http://bibhost/) if it exists. Otherwise, resolution is
  performed by a document-specified server or a known global
  server.</p>

  <h2><a name="exec_url" id="exec_url">The <em>lynxexec</em> and
  <em>lynxprog</em> URLs:</a></h2>

  <p>If execution of spawned commands has been enabled in your
  <strong>Lynx</strong> image, the lynxexec and lynxprog URLs can
  be used to execute arbitrary system commands or invoke system
  utilities. Any system command and associated switches or
  qualifiers can be used, with the syntax appropriate for a shell
  running <strong>Lynx</strong> on Unix, or for DCL on VMS,
  e.g.:</p>
  <pre>
      <em>lynxexec:dir/date/size foo:[blah]</em> (VMS)
      <em>lynxexec:ls -l /foo/blah</em>          (Unix)
      <em>lynxprog:news</em>
</pre>

  <p>(Note, however, that restrictions on acceptable commands or
  utilities may be imposed by the system administrator.)</p>

  <p>You optionally can include <em>//localhost/</em> in the URL,
  between the scheme field and the command, but that is always
  implied. The lynxexec and lynxprog URLs differ only in that with
  lynxexec you are prompted to enter <em>RETURN</em> before
  <strong>Lynx</strong> clears the screen and restores the
  previously displayed document, so that you can read any screen
  output generated by the spawned command, whereas no such pause is
  imposed upon exit from the utility invoked via lynxprog.</p>

  <p>These are Lynxisms and should be used only in local documents
  intended solely for <strong>Lynx</strong>.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="cgi_url" id="cgi_url">The <em>lynxcgi</em>
  URL:</a></h2>

  <p>The lynxcgi URL is implemented only on Unix, can be used as
  the ACTION for a FORM, and if enabled in your
  <strong>Lynx</strong> image has the format:</p>
  <pre>
      <em>lynxcgi://localhost/path_to_CGI_script</em>
</pre>

  <p>where <em>//localhost</em> is optional and always implied; the
  full path should be specified, as `~' is not recognized; if the
  script is in the directory <strong>Lynx</strong> was started
  from, the simple file name is adequate. The output of the script
  should be text/html and is rendered and displayed by
  <strong>Lynx</strong>. Restrictions on use of lynxcgi and on
  acceptable paths can be imposed in <em>userdefs.h</em> and
  <em>lynx.cfg</em>, qv.</p>

  <p>This is a Lynxism and should be used only in local documents
  intended solely for <strong>Lynx</strong>, or for limited local
  testing of CGI scripts without an http server.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="ncftp_url" id="ncftp_url">The <em>NcFTP</em>
  URL:</a></h2>

  <p><strong>Lynx</strong> recognizes the NcFTP-style ftp URL,
  e.g.,</p>
  <pre>
        <cite>ftpHost</cite>:<cite>fileSpecification</cite>
</pre>

  <p>for example</p>
  <pre>
<code>
        ftp.gnu.org:/pub/gnu
</code>
</pre>
  <hr>

  <h2><a name="internal_url" id="internal_url">The <em>LYNXfoo</em>
  internal URLs:</a></h2>

  <p><strong>Lynx</strong> uses a variety of private URL schemes
  for communication among its internal modules. They start with
  uppercase letters <code>LYNX</code> by convention, although, as
  input, URL schemes are recognized in a case-insensitive
  manner.</p>

  <p>As you discover what they are, and are tempted to use them
  externally in documents, you should <em>resist</em> that
  temptation:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>There already is too much browser-specific markup
    around...</li>

    <li>The schemes, or their meanings, may change between
    <strong>Lynx</strong> versions.</li>

    <li>Even if a scheme stays the same, some aspect of its
    behavior may be modified without notice, or the context in
    which it is allowed may change.</li>

    <li>If it doesn't work as expected when used outside of the
    intended purpose, don't expect anyone to "fix" it.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>For example, tempting though it might be, do not use
  these:</p>
  <pre>
      <em>Return to your &lt;A HREF="LYNXHIST:0"&gt;Startfile&lt;/A&gt;</em>
      <em>Review your &lt;A HREF="LYNXKEYMAP:"&gt;Keymap&lt;/A&gt;</em>
</pre>

  <p>(No, they won't do any harm. Yes, they work. But don't rely on
  it.)</p>

  <p>If you must try one, the second is OK from the command
  line:<br></p>
  <pre>
      <em>lynx LYNXKEYMAP:</em>
</pre>

  <p>But within <strong>Lynx</strong>, use the '<em>K</em>'
  keystroke command. Sometimes it may be convenient to use a
  private scheme with '<em>g</em>'oto, as in:</p>
  <pre>
      <em>g LYNXMESSAGES:</em>
      <em>g LYNXCOMPILEOPTS:</em>
      <em>g LYNXCFG:</em>
</pre>

  <p>But again, there usually is a way in which those special pages
  are meant to be reached that is more convenient.</p>

<H1><em>URL Schemes Supported in Lynx</em></H1>

Lynx handles a number of URL types, that are enumerated below.  For
more details about URLs (Uniform Resource Locators) see <em>RFC1738</em>:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/Addressing/rfc1738.txt"
>http://www.w3.org/Addressing/rfc1738.txt</a>
<li><a href="ftp://ftp.rfc-editor.org/in-notes/rfc1738.txt"
>ftp://ftp.rfc-editor.org/in-notes/rfc1738.txt</a>
</ul>

<p>Lynx resolves partial or relative URLs in documents with respect to
the BASE if one was specified, otherwise with respect to the document's
absolute URL, using the rules described in <em>RFC1808</em>:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/Addressing/rfc1808.txt"
>http://www.w3.org/Addressing/rfc1808.txt</a>
<li><a href="ftp://ftp.rfc-editor.org/in-notes/rfc1808.txt"
>ftp://ftp.rfc-editor.org/in-notes/rfc1808.txt</a>
</ul>

and in subsequent drafts of the <em>IETF</em>:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/uri/"
>Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI) Working Group</a>
</ul>

<p>When entering a URL on the command line to be used as the
<em>startfile</em>, or at the prompt for a '<em>g</em>'oto entry, a
partial host field can be used and the scheme field can be omitted if
the scheme and fully qualified domain name can be constructed internally
by using the URL_DOMAIN_PREFIXES and URL_DOMAIN_SUFFIXES definitions in
the Lynx configuration file.  See the explanation of those definitions
and their use in your <em>lynx.cfg</em>.  For example, <em>wfbr</em> will
be treated as <em>http://www.wfbr.edu/</em>, and <em>wfbr/dir/lynx</em>
will be treated as <em>http://www.wfbr.edu/dir/lynx</em>, but
<em>gopher.wfbr.edu/11/_fileserv/_lynx</em> will be treated as
<em>gopher://gopher.wfbr.edu/11/_fileserv/_lynx</em>.  For files or
directories on the local host, a tilde (<em>~</em>) is expanded to
the path of the account's login directory, e.g., <em>~/foo</em> will
be expanded to <em>file://localhost/your/login/directory/foo</em>.
The tilde expansion is done homologously on Unix and VMS. On VMS,
Lynx also will expand any file or directory spec recognizable to
DCL into a valid URL, e.g., <em>[]</em> will be expanded to
<em>file://localhost/current/default/directory</em>.  These expansions
are <em>SOLELY</em> for <em>startfile</em> or '<em>g</em>'oto entries!
Any partial or relative URLs within HTML documents are resolved
according to the rules specified in RFC1808 and subsequent IETF drafts.
<HR>

<H2><a name="http_url">The <em>http</em> and <em>https</em> URLs:</a></H2>

Lynx handles http URLs exactly as specified in RFC1738.  The format
is:
<pre>
d109 25
a133 19
where <em>:port</em> is optional and defaults to <em>:80</em>,
<em>/path</em> if present is a slash-separated series of symbolic
elements, and <em>?searchpart</em> if present is the query for an ISINDEX
search or the content of a FORM with METHOD="GET".  The <em>#fragment</em>
field if present indicates a location in the document to seek for display,
based on a NAME-ed anchor or an ID attribute within the document, and is
technically an instruction rather than part of the URL.  Lynx will treat
ID attributes as NAME-ed anchors for all tags in the BODY of a document
which can correspond to positions in the rendering of the document.

<p>The https URL has the same format, but the default port is <em>:443</em>.
<HR>

<H2><a name="telnet_url"
>The <em>telnet</em>, <em>tn3270</em>, and <em>rlogin</em> URLs:</a></H2>

A <em>telnet</em> URL generally results in Lynx spawning a telnet
session.  Lynx implements the complete telnet URL scheme, i.e.:
<pre>
d137 15
a151 14
<p>The <em>user</em> and/or <em>:password</em> fields may be omitted, and
the <em>@@</em> should be omitted if neither is present.  The port defaults
to <em>:23</em> when omitted in the URL.

<p>A <em>tn3270</em> or <em>rlogin</em> URL is specified equivalently,
and similarly spawns a tn3270 or rlogin session.  The actual behavior
is dependent on the TCP-IP software installed on the local and target
hosts.

<p>It is unwise to include the <em>:password</em> field except for
URLs which point to anonymous or other public access accounts, and
for most TCP-IP software you will be prompted for a password whether
or not one was included in the URL.
<HR>
d153 2
a154 1
<H2><a name="gopher_url">The <em>gopher</em> URL:</a></H2>
d156 2
a157 2
The gopher URL takes the form:
<pre>
d160 35
a194 29
where <em>:port</em> is optional and defaults to <em>:70</em>, and the
<em>/gopher-path</em> is opaque (not fully equivalent to the
slash-separated series of symbolic elements of http paths) as explained
in RFC1738.  Typically, the gopher-path consists of a
<A HREF="keystrokes/gopher_types_help.html"><em>gophertype</em></A>
indicating the file or service type (e.g., <em>0</em> or <em>I</em> for
plain text or an image, respectively, <em>7</em> for a search, or <em>1</em>
for a directory), followed by a platform-specific <em>selector</em>. Any
reserved characters in the selector should be hex escaped (<em>%hh</em>),
including slashes, although hex escaping of slashes is not required by Lynx
in gopher URLs.

<p>Lynx does not overtly support the gopher+ protocol, and does not
represent itself as gopher+ capable when communicating with gopher
servers.  Lynx might transmit any (hex-escaped-tab-separated) extended
gopher+ fields in a URL if an author included them in a document, but is
likely to mishandle what the gopher server returns in such cases, and would
not generate and transmit them itself.  For pre-formed URLs to submit gopher
searches, it may be better to use a <em>?</em> rather than hex-escaped tab
(<em>%09</em>) as the separator for the <em>searchpart</em> in the
<em>selector</em>, e.g.:<BR>
<em>gopher://gopher.wfbr.edu/77/_shell/search.shell%20/_shell/walker?lynx*</em>
Lynx will handle the <em>%09</em> if you use that instead of <em>?</em>,
but other WWW clients may mishandle it.

<p>For the <em>gophertype</em> which signifies HTML (<em>h</em>), if the
<em>selector</em> begins with <em>GET%20/</em> Lynx will convert the gopher
URL to an http URL, e.g.:<BR>
<pre>
d197 3
a199 2
will become:<BR>
<pre>
d202 17
a218 14
The port field will be retained if it is not <em>:80</em>, and will default
to <em>:70</em> if it was defaulted originally.  These conventions were
adopted during development of the University of Minnesota gopher software
to facilitate the offering of links to MIME-capable http servers in the
listings returned by gopher servers, but should be considered Lynxisms
and UMN Gopherisms.
<HR>

<H2><a name="file_url">The <em>file</em> URL:</a></H2>

The file URL is used to retrieve files or generate a directory listing
on the local host.  The host field can be <em>localhost</em> or a domain
name for the local host:<BR>
<pre>
d221 8
a228 7
If you do not use <em>localhost</em> or a domain name for the local host,
Lynx will substitute <em>ftp://</em> for <em>file://</em> and treat it
as an ftp URL.

<p>The <em>/path</em> is treated as originating at the root, unless
you include a tilde (<em>~</em>), e.g.:
<pre>
a231 2
The latter feature is a Lynxism, is done homologously on Unix and VMS,
and should be used ONLY in local documents intended for Lynx.
d233 7
a239 3
<p>On VMS, the first element of the path, if not a tilde, is assumed to
be a device, e.g.:
<pre>
a241 7
should be used for: <em>www_root:[directory]filename.suffix</em><BR>
If you are unsure how to specify a file URL in local documents on
VMS, invoke Lynx with the desired file or directory as the
<em>startfile</em> using any spec acceptable to DCL, and then
use the <em>showinfo</em> command (<em>=</em>) to see the file
URL which Lynx created for it.
<HR>
d243 10
a252 1
<H2><a name="ftp_url">The <em>ftp</em> URL:</a></H2>
d254 2
a255 2
The ftp URL has the general format:
<pre>
d260 42
a301 37
<p>The default port is <em>:21</em> and the default <em>username</em>
is <em>anonymous</em>.  If <em>username</em> is included,
Lynx will prompt you for the password.  For anonymous ftp, Lynx uses your
<em>personal_mail_address</em> (user@@host) as the <em>password</em>
if it has been defined via the '<em>o</em>'ptions menu.  Otherwise,
Lynx uses the dummy password <em>WWWUser</em>.
(A password can also be embedded in the URL, by replacing
<em>username</em> with <em>username:password</em>.  This is strongly
discouraged for 'real' passwords that must be kept secret, since URLs
with the completely unencrypted <em>password</em> may show up on the
screen, in HISTORY and LIST pages etc., and may even become visible to
remote sites for example through Referer headers.)
Do not include the <em>@@</em> if neither <em>username</em> nor
<em>:password</em> is included.

<p>The <em>;type=</em> parameter can be used with value <em>D</em>,
<em>I</em>, or <em>A</em> to force handling of the URL as, respectively,
a directory listing, binary file, or ASCII file.  The Lynx ftp gateway
normally determines this itself, but the parameter can be used if the
internal procedure draws an incorrect inference about the nature of
the ftp URL.

<p>The <em>/path</em> is treated according to RFC1738 for VMS
and VM/CMS ftp servers.  The lead slash (<em>/</em>) is treated purely
as a separator, not as a designator for the root, and the <em>path</em>
string if present is treated as in or under the login directory.  For
VMS ftp servers, if you wish to have the first element treated as a
device rather than file or subdirectory name, begin it with a hex-escaped
slash (<em>%2f</em>), e.g.:<BR>
<pre>
<em>ftp://user@@myhost/%2fsys$common/syshlp</em>
</pre>
can be used for a listing of sys$common:[syshlp]<BR>
Also, on VM/CMS ftp servers, if the <em>path</em> string begins
with <em>vmsysu%3a</em> it receives special handling as an SFS
path, e.g.:
<pre>
d305 10
a314 9
<p>For Unix and Unix-emulation ftp servers, RFC1738 is not respected
and the lead slash is treated as the root, i.e., the <em>/path</em> is
handled equivalently to that in file URLs.  The distinction is
irrelevant for anonymous ftp, but matters when using ftp for
non-anonymous accounts.  If you are using ftp with a Unix server and
do wish to get a listing of the login directory or have the <em>path</em>
string treated as a file or path under the login directory, include a
tilde (<em>~</em>) as for <a href="#file">file</a> URLs, e.g.:
<pre>
d317 1
a317 1
<HR>
d319 2
a320 1
<H2><a name="wais_url">The <em>wais</em> URL:</a></H2>
d322 3
a324 3
The wais URL is used to retrieve resources using the Wide Area Information
System protocol.  The format is:
<pre>
a328 1
where <em>:port</em> defaults to <em>:210</em>
d330 1
a330 2
<p>Direct wais support is built into Lynx for VMS, and can be compiled
into Lynx on Unix.
d332 2
a333 29
<p>If only a <em>database</em> is indicated in the URL, Lynx returns
an ISINDEX cover page for searching that <em>database</em>, and will
submit your search with the <em>wais_query</em> appended.  Lynx will
convert the server's reply into a hit list with URLs that include the
<em>wais_type</em> and <em>wais_path</em> for retrieving items from
the hit list.
<HR>

<H2><a name="news_url"
>The <em>news</em>, <em>nntp</em>, and <em>snews</em> URLs:</a></H2>

The news and nntp URLs are handled by Lynx as specified in RFC1738, but
for compatibility with other clients, Lynx allows inclusion of host and
port fields in news URLs, which properly should be used <em>only</em> in
nntp and snews URLs.  If not included in news URLs, Lynx will use the nntp
server pointed to by the NNTPSERVER environment variable or configuration
symbol (see lynx.cfg), with default port <em>:119</em>.  A host field must
be included in nntp URLs, and the port field is optional with the same
default.

<p>If the URL requires authentication,
lynx will prompt you for the username and password.
These are cached during a session,
for reuse on the same host.
If $HOME/.newsauth exists,
lynx initializes its cache from this file.
The .newsauth file contents are one line per entry:
hostname, password and username
(in that order) separated by a space.
d335 32
a366 2
<p>The formats are:<BR>
<pre>
a373 1
(snews same as nntp, but the default port is <em>:563</em>)
d375 11
a385 7
<p>The <em>messageID</em> is the message's unique identifier, consisting
of an identification string and the host of origin for the message
(<em>ident_string@@origin_host</em>).

<p>Lynx also supports wildcarding via an asterisk for listings of news
hierarchies or sub-hierarchies, e.g.:
<pre>
a388 2
(snews same as nntp, but the default port is <em>:563</em>)<BR>
This is not in RFC1738 and may not be supported by all other clients.
d390 18
a407 10
<p>Lynx allows you both to <em>reply</em> to the author of a news message
via email, and, if news posting has been enabled, to send a <em>followup</em>
message to the newsgroup (see <a href="#newspost">newspost, newsreply,
snewspost, snewsreply</a>).

<p>Lynx converts any strings in news messages which appear to be a URL
with a supported scheme into a link for accessing that URL.

<p>Lynx also supports the newsgroup and message number URL scheme:<BR>
<pre>
d413 30
a442 25
(snews same as nntp, but the default port is <em>:563</em>)<BR>
Use of this scheme is not recommended, because the message numbers
are specific to each nntp server, unlike the unique identifiers for
news messages.
<HR>

<H2><a name="newspost_url"
>The <em>newspost</em>, <em>newsreply</em>, <em>snewspost</em>, and
<em>snewsreply</em> URLs:</a></H2>

When Lynx receives group listings or articles via <em>news</em>,
<em>nntp</em> or <em>snews</em> URLs, it also checks whether the
nntp server supports posting from the Lynx user's site, and if so,
includes links for posting new messages to that server, or for posting
followups (replies) to previously posted messages.  RFC1738, and IETF
URL drafts through this release of Lynx, do not include any schemes
for posting to news groups.  Lynx has long supported newspost and
newreply URL schemes for posting new messages or sending followups,
respectively, to standard nntp servers, with default port <em>:119</em>.
Lynx now also supports homologous snewspost and snewsreply URLs for use
with SSL capable nntp servers.

<p>The formats are:
<pre>
      <em>newspost://host:port/newsgroup(s)</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;(post a new message)
a444 2
(snewspost and snewsreply have the same formats, but the default port is
<em>:563</em>)
d446 33
a478 26
<p>If the host field is omitted, it defaults to that pointed to by the
NNTPSERVER configuration or environmental variable.  Inclusion of at
least one newsgroup in the URL is required, and additional groups can
be specified as a comma-separated list.  Wildcarding of newsgroup names
is not supported for these URLs.  For newsreply and snewsreply URLs, if
an external editor has been defined via the <em>Options Menu</em>, the
user is offered an option to include the currently displayed document,
which presumably is a news article with a <em>followup</em> link that
was activated, and if confirmed, each line of that document is prefixed
with a right-angle-bracket.  The user is expected to edit such an inclusion
so that only the passages relevant to the followup message are retained.

<p>These URLs can be used as command line startfiles (in which case, Lynx
will exit after posting the message, and the newreply or snewsreply URLs
degrade to newspost or snewpost URLs, respectively).  They also can be used
as HREF attribute values in any HTML document homologously to <a
href="#mailto">mailto</a> URLs, with the qualification that they presently
are supported only by Lynx.
<HR>

<H2><a name="mailto_url">The <em>mailto</em> URL:</a></H2>

The mailto URL is used to provide links that when activated can be
used to send a comment or the content of a FORM to an Internet email
address (user@@host).  The format is:
<pre>
d482 17
a498 14
<p>The description of the mailto URL in RFC1738 has been interpreted by
some as allowing only a single recipient, but Lynx invented the mailto URL,
has always supported a series of user@@host addresses as a comma-separated
list, and still does.  For compatibility with Explorer, Lynx also accepts
a semi-colon-separated list.

<p>For compatibility with Netscape, Lynx parses any
<em>?subject=The%20Subject</em> appended to the URL, trims the URL
at the <em>?</em>, and uses the value as the default Subject: for
the message or FORM content mailing.  This is not recommended practice.
The preferred way to indicate the default Subject: for a LINK or Anchor
with a mailto HREF, or a FORM with a mailto ACTION, is via a TITLE
attribute with the subject string as its value, e.g.:
<pre>
d510 113
a622 100
<p>Note that a TITLE attribute for FORM is now included in the HTML
specifications.  Some clients use a SUBJECT attribute for this purpose
in FORM tags, and Lynx recognizes that as a synonym for TITLE.

<p>Lynx also will process any <em>to=address(es)</em>,
<em>cc=address(es)</em>, <em>keywords=word_list</em> and/or
<em>body=message</em> fields in <em>?searchpart</em> tack-ons to mailto
URLs.  The <em>to</em> and/or <em>cc</em> values can be single addresses,
or comma- or semi-colon-separated lists of addresses.  All addresses,
and any <em>body</em> values, will be offered for approval by the user
before proceeding with a mailing.   Any other name=value pairs in the
<em>?searchpart</em> will be ignored.  Also, if the mailto URL is the
ACTION for a FORM, any <em>body</em> in a <em>?searchpart</em> tack-on
will be ignored, because the body of the mailing must be constructed
solely from the the FORM's content.  Lynx expects multiple name=value
pairs in a <em>?searchpart</em> tack-on to be separated by ampersands,
as in the original Netscape implementation, and in an equally ill-advised
IETF draft of that implementation (<a
href="ftp://ftp.isi.edu/internet-drafts/draft-hoffman-mailto-url-03.txt"
>draft-hoffman-mailto-url-03.txt</a>).  These should be represented as
entities (<em>&amp;amp;</em>) in the HTML markup.  This functionality
is generally desired, but the IETF backward compatibility principal
normally would lead to a new scheme being used (e.g., <em>mail:</em>, or
<em>smtp:</em>), rather than breaking <em>mailto:</em> implementations.

<p>If <em>ENCTYPE="text/plain"</em> is specified for a FORM with a mailto
ACTION, Lynx will not hex escape the name=value pairs of the FORM's content,
and will use physical newlines instead of '<em>&amp;</em>' or '<em>;</em>'
to separate the pairs, so that the content will be readable directly.
Otherwise, Lynx will mail the content with the default:
<pre>
      <em>ENCTYPE="application/x-www-form-urlencoded"</em> ('<em >&amp;</em>' separates pairs)
</pre>
or:
<pre>
      <em>ENCTYPE="application/sgml-form-urlencoded"</em> ('<em >;</em>' separates pairs)
</pre>
if the latter was indicated.

<p>Note that when mailing FORM content Lynx wraps any lines longer than 78
characters, to avoid buffer overflows in mail software and to ensure reliable
transmission across gateways.  If the ENCTYPE was not <em>text/plain</em>,
any script which decodes the mailed content should ignore the physical
newlines and recognize only hex escaped newline characters as intended
to be present in the decoded content.

<p>If the mailto URL is not the ACTION for a FORM, and if an external
editor has been defined via the <em>Options Menu</em>, the user is offered
an option to include the currently displayed document.  If this option is
accepted, each line of that document is prefixed with a right-angle-bracket,
and the prefixed inclusion should be trimmed by the user to just those
passages relevant to the message which will be sent.
<HR>

<H2><a name="finger_url">The <em>finger</em> URL:</a></H2>

Lynx has full support for the finger protocol, but a format for finger
URLs has not yet been adopted by the IETF.  The formats supported by Lynx
therefore include every possibility not inconsistent with RFC1738,
including:

<pre>
 finger://host                         finger://@@host
 finger://host/                        finger://@@host/
 finger://host/%2fw                    finger://@@host/w
 finger://host/w                       finger://host/w/
 finger://host/username[@@host]         finger://username@@host
 finger://host/username[@@host]/        finger://username@@host/
 finger://host/w/username[@@host]       finger://username@@host/w
 finger://host/%2fw%20username[@@host]  finger://host/username[@@host]/w
 finger://host/w/username
</pre>

<p>Activating a finger URL will send a request to the finger server via
port 79 on the host specified.  You can include <em>:79</em> in the URL,
but no other value is allowed.  The <em>/w</em> or <em>/%2fw</em> is used
to request a full report for finger servers which support it, and is not
case sensitive (i.e., can be <em>/W</em> or <em>/%2fW</em>).  Any strings
in the report which appear to be a URL with a supported scheme will be
converted into a link for accessing that URL.

<p>An alternative way to access finger servers is via gopher URLs with
port 79 and the plain text (<em>0</em>) <em>gophertype</em> specified:<BR>
<em>gopher://host:79/0</em><BR>
Lynx will handle such URLs equivalently to overt finger URLs, including
creation of links for any strings which appear to be supported URLs.
<HR>

<H2><a name="cso_url">The <em>cso</em> URL:</a></H2>

The cso URL is intended to provide a gateway to CSO/PH (QI) servers.
The requests are made on port 105 by default (<em>:105</em>), with the
following overt cso URL format:<BR>
<pre>
<em>cso://host</em>
</pre>

<p>You also can use a gopher URL format with port 105 and the CSO
(<em>2</em>) <em>gophertype</em> specified:
<pre>
d626 30
a655 24
<p>Lynx will parse the stream returned by the server for the above
URLs and create a FORM for submitting additional requests (searches)
to the server.   Any strings in the reports returned for these requests
(searches) which appear to be a URL with a supported scheme will be
converted into a link for accessing that URL.
<HR>

<H2><a name="bibp_url">The <em>bibp</em> URL:</a></H2>

<p>Lynx provides built-in support for bibliographic protocol (BibP).
BibP links are links to published works such as books or journal articles,
without a predefined server.  BibP links are intended for resolution
by a local bibhost server (http://bibhost/) if it exists.   Otherwise,
resolution is performed by a document-specified server or a known global
server.

<H2><a name="exec_url">The <em>lynxexec</em> and <em>lynxprog</em> URLs:</a></H2>

If execution of spawned commands has been enabled in your Lynx image, the
lynxexec and lynxprog URLs can be used to execute arbitrary system commands
or invoke system utilities.  Any system command and associated switches
or qualifiers can be used, with the syntax appropriate for a shell running
Lynx on Unix, or for DCL on VMS, e.g.:
<pre>
a659 2
(Note, however, that restrictions on acceptable commands or utilities
may be imposed by the system administrator.)
d661 23
a683 17
<p>You optionally can include <em>//localhost/</em> in the URL, between the
scheme field and the command, but that is always implied.  The lynxexec
and lynxprog URLs differ only in that with lynxexec you are prompted to
enter <em>RETURN</em> before Lynx clears the screen and restores the
previously displayed document, so that you can read any screen output
generated by the spawned command, whereas no such pause is imposed upon exit
from the utility invoked via lynxprog.

<p>These are Lynxisms and should be used only in local documents intended
solely for Lynx.
<HR>

<H2><a name="cgi_url">The <em>lynxcgi</em> URL:</a></H2>

The lynxcgi URL is implemented only on Unix, can be used as the
ACTION for a FORM, and if enabled in your Lynx image has the format:
<pre>
a685 42
where <em>//localhost</em> is optional and always implied;
the full path should be specified, as `~' is not recognized;
if the script is in the directory Lynx was started from,
the simple file name is adequate.  The output of the script
should be text/html and is rendered and displayed by Lynx.
Restrictions on use of lynxcgi and on acceptable paths can be imposed
in <em>userdefs.h</em> and <em>lynx.cfg</em>, qv.

<p>This is a Lynxism and should be used only in local documents intended
solely for Lynx, or for limited local testing of CGI scripts without an
http server.
<HR>

<H2><a name="ncftp_url">The <em>NcFTP</em> URL:</a></H2>

Lynx recognizes the NcFTP-style ftp URL, e.g.,
<pre>
	<cite>ftpHost</cite>:<cite>fileSpecification</cite>
</pre>
for example
<pre><code>
	ftp.gnu.org:/pub/gnu
</code></pre>
<HR>

<H2><a name="internal_url">The <em>LYNXfoo</em> internal URLs:</a></H2>

Lynx uses a variety of private URL schemes for communication among its
internal modules.  They start with uppercase letters <code>LYNX</code>
by convention, although, as input, URL schemes are recognized in a
case-insensitive manner.
<p>
As you discover what they are, and are tempted to use them externally in
documents, you should <em>resist</em> that temptation:
<UL><LI>There already is too much browser-specific markup around...
<LI>The schemes, or their meanings, may change between Lynx versions.
<LI>Even if a scheme stays the same, some aspect of its behavior may
    be modified without notice, or the context in which it is allowed
    may change.
<LI>If it doesn't work as expected when used outside of the intended
    purpose, don't expect anyone to "fix" it.
</UL>
d687 62
a748 2
<p>For example, tempting though it might be, do not use these:
<pre>
a751 1
(No, they won't do any harm.  Yes, they work.  But don't rely on it.)
d753 6
a758 2
<p>If you must try one, the second is OK from the command line:<BR>
<pre>
d761 5
a765 4
But within Lynx, use the '<em>K</em>' keystroke command.
Sometimes it may be convenient to use a private scheme with
'<em>g</em>'oto, as in:
<pre>
d770 5
a774 4
But again, there usually is a way in which those special pages are
meant to be reached that is more convenient.

by Lynx. (Note that restrictions on acceptable paths can be imposed
by the system administrator.)

Lynx uses a variety of internal URL schemes as structured stream
objects for communication among its display modules.  If you discover
what they are, and are tempted to use them externally in documents,
find the self-restraint to <em>resist</em> that temptation!!!

<p>For example, tempting though it might be, do <em>not</em> use these:<BR>
<tab indent="12"
><em>Return to your &lt;A HREF="LYNXHIST:0"&gt;Startfile&lt;/A&gt;</em><BR>
<tab indent="12"
><em>Review your &lt;A HREF="LYNXKEYMAP:"&gt;Keymap&lt;/A&gt;</em><BR>
(Yes, they'll work.  No, they won't do any harm.  But...)

a633 2
<p>If you <em>must</em> try one, the second is OK from the command line:<BR>
<tab indent="12"><em>lynx LYNXKEYMAP:</em><BR>

<H2><a name="chargen">The <em>chargen</em> URL:</a></H2>

The chargen URL is intended to provide a gateway to the chargen service.
The requests are made on port 19 (<em>:19</em>).  You can omit the port,
and no other value is allowed.  The format is:<BR>
<tab indent="12"><em>chargen://host</em><BR>

<p>Lynx will accept approximately 55 lines of characters in the stream
returned by the server, then close the connection and display the lines
as PRE formatted text.  Note that if port 19 is used for a URL with a
scheme other than chargen, the URL will be rejected by Lynx.
