  "Describes the bash-like line editor bindings for Lynx. This is one of the alternate bindings normally compiled-in">
  </head>

<body>
  <h2>Overview</h2>

  <p>Lynx invokes a built-in <a href="edit_help.html">Line
  Editor</a> for entering strings in response to prompts, in forms,
  and for email messages if an external editor has not been
  defined. Several sets of key-bindings can be offered by
  configuring with --enable-alt-bindings or by adding them in
  LYEditmap.c before compiling Lynx. If available, they may be
  selected via the 'o'ptions menu, or by editing lineedit_mode in
  the '.lynxrc' file.</p>

  <p>Note: setting emacs/vi keys ON has no direct effect on
  line-editor bindings.</p>

  <p>This summarizes the <em>Bash-like Binding</em> keymap.</p>

  <h2>Basic commands</h2>
  <pre>
     ENTER  Input complete        -  Enter, RETURN
     TAB    Completion / Next     -  TAB, Do (<em>see note 2</em>)
     ABORT  Cancel / Undo Change  -  C-g, C-_
     ERASE  Erase the line        -  M-k, C-x k

     BACK   Cursor back     char  -  Left-Arrow,  C-b
     FORW   Cursor forward  char  -  Right-Arrow, C-f
     BACKW  Cursor back     word  -  M-b, C-r
     FORWW  Cursor forward  word  -  M-f, C-s (<em>see note 5</em>)
     BOL    Go to begin of  line  -  C-a, Home, Find
     EOL    Go to end   of  line  -  C-e, End,  Select (<em>see note 4</em>)

     DELP   Delete prev     char  -  C-h, Backspace, Rubout
     DELN   Delete next     char  -  C-d, Delete, Remove (<em>see note 1</em>)
     DELPW  Delete prev     word  -  C-w, M-Backspace, M-Delete (?) (<em>see note 3</em>)
     DELNW  Delete next     word  -  M-d
     DELBL  Delete to beg of line -  C-u
     DELEL  Delete to end of line -  C-k (<em>see note 4</em>)

     UPPER  Upper case the line   -  M-u
     LOWER  Lower case the line   -  M-l

     LKCMD  Invoke cmd prompt     -  C-v [FORM]
     SWMAP  Switch input keymap   -  C-^ (if compiled in)

<a name="TASpecial" id=
"TASpecial">Special commands for use in textarea fields</a> [FORM]:

     PASS!  Textarea external edit  - C-e C-e, C-x e (<em>see note 4</em>)
     PASS!  Insert file in textarea - C-x i
     PASS!  Grow textarea           - C-x g
</pre>

  <h2>Try it yourself</h2>

  <p>Here is a little textarea for practice:</p>

  <form action="">
    <p>
    <textarea name="practice" cols="40" rows="5">
This text cannot be submitted.  Normally lines like
these would be part of a form that is filled out and
then submitted.  You can move around here and delete
or add text as you like, using the Line-Editor keys.
</textarea><input type="reset" value="[reset content]"></p>
  </form>

  <h2>Advanced emacs-like commands</h2>
  <pre>

    TPOS    Transpose characters                   -  C-t
    SETMARK Set mark at current position in line   -  C-@@
    XPMARK  Exchange current position with mark    -  C-x C-x
    KILLREG Kill region between mark and position  -  C-x C-w (<em>see note 3</em>)
    YANK    Insert text last killed (with KILLREG) -  C-y
</pre>

  <h2>Comments on special keys</h2>

  <p><samp><dfn>C-</dfn><strong>key</strong> means
  Control+<strong><kbd>key</kbd></strong>.
  <dfn><code>C-x</code></dfn> <strong>key</strong> means first
  Control+<kbd>x</kbd>, then <strong><kbd>key</kbd></strong>.
  <dfn>M-</dfn>key means Meta+<strong><kbd>key</kbd></strong>,
  where Meta is a modifier that can be entered in a variety of
  ways:</samp></p>

  <ul>
    <li>First ESC, then the <strong><kbd>key</kbd></strong>. This
    doesn't work with all systems or on all connections, and if it
    does may not work for some keys (because the ESC character is
    also part of code sequences for "normal" function keys).</li>

    <li>Alt+<strong><kbd>key</kbd></strong>. This works if the
    terminal, console, or comm program is set up to interpret Alt
    as a modifier to send ESC. The Linux console acts like that by
    default for most keys; Kermit can be set up to do it, xterm can
    be for some keys, and so on. But the same caveats as for the
    previous item apply. This Alt mapping may also be possible,
    independent of the ESC character, for some keys in Lynx for
    DOS/i386 or for Win32.</li>

    <li>C-x <strong><kbd>key</kbd></strong>. Actually, currently
    the same internal table is used for Meta and the C-x prefix.
    Therefore all M-<strong><kbd>key</kbd></strong> combinations
    can also be typed as C-x <strong><kbd>key</kbd></strong>, and
    vice versa.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Notes</h2>

  <ol>
    <li>"next" means the character "under" a box or underline style
    cursor; it means "to the immediate right of" an I-beam (between
    characters) type cursor.</li>

    <li>For entering strings in response to prompts (that is, when
    not editing form text fields), some keys have different
    actions: TAB tries to complete input based on previous
    response; Up-Arrow and Down-Arrow may offer previous response
    and next response, respectively, from recall buffer for some
    prompts.</li>

    <li>C-w can only be used for editing functions if its default
    KEYMAP to REFRESH is changed. This can be done in the lynx.cfg
    file, for example with the line "KEYMAP:^W:DO_NOTHING". This
    also applies for other keys: as long as the key's action is
    mapped to REFRESH, either with an explicit KEYMAP in lynx.cfg
    or by default, the key's Line Editor binding is disabled.</li>

    <li>These keys invoke special behavior when pressed twice in a
    row: C-e C-e calls the external editor for changing the text in
    a textarea (if available). C-k C-k will move to the next link,
    so that all lines in a textarea can be conveniently cleared by
    repeating C-k.</li>

    <li>Key is likely unavailable for Lynx, because it is
    interpreted by operating system, comm program, or curses
    library, or swallowed as part of escape sequence recognition.
    Binding is provided for the benefit of those where this doesn't
    apply.</li>

    <li>where <strong>[FORM]</strong> is marked, indicates that the
    binding is effective only in form text fields. It is ignored by
    Line Editor elsewhere.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>When a text input field, including a textarea line, is
  selected, the Line Editor functions get a first grab at the keys
  entered. If a key has no function defined in the Line Editor
  binding, it can either be ignored, or passed on for normal key
  command handling, where modifiers like C-x or Meta currently have
  no effect (see the <a href="LYNXKEYMAP:">Key Map Page</a>
  accessible with the key <kbd>K</kbd> for current
  information).</p>

  <h2>Additional details on other keys, for the curious (very much
  subject to change)</h2>

[emacskey] Normal key action subject to emacs_keys setting.

[!] Action of key with Meta modifier follows action of key without
    Meta.  If you manage to enter the Meta key while Line-Editor
    Binding is not set to Bash-Like, and the unmodified binding
    is different from that listed here, M-&lt;<var>key</var>&gt; will act
    like &lt;<var>key</var>&gt;.

Lynx invokes a built-in <em>Line Editor</em> for entering strings in
response to prompts, in forms, and for email messages if an external editor
has not been defined.  Several sets of key-bindings can be offered
by configuring with --enable-alt-bindings or by adding them in
LYEditmap.c before compiling Lynx.  If available,
they may be selected via the 'o'ptions menu, or by editing lineedit_mode in
the '.lynxrc' file.

<p>Note: setting emacs/vi keys ON has no direct effect on line-editor bindings.

</UL><pre>
[1] "next" means the character "under" a box or underline style cursor; it
    means "to the immediate right of" an I-beam (between characters) type
    cursor.
[2] For entering strings in response to prompts (that is, when not editing
    form text fields), some keys have different actions: TAB tries to
    complete input based on previous response; Up-Arrow and Down-Arrow
    may offer previous response and next response, respectively, from

[3] C-w can only be used for editing functions if its default KEYMAP
    to REFRESH is changed.  This can be done in the lynx.cfg file,
    for example with the line "KEYMAP:^W:DO_NOTHING".  This also applies
    for other keys: as long as the key's action is mapped to REFRESH,
    either with an explicit KEYMAP in lynx.cfg or by default, the
    key's Line Editor binding is disabled.
[4] These keys invoke special behavior when pressed twice in a row:
    C-e C-e calls the external editor for changing the text in a
    textarea (if available).  C-k C-k will move to the next link,

    repeating C-k.
[5] Key is likely unavailable for Lynx, because it is interpreted by
    operating system, comm program, or curses library, or swallowed
    as part of escape sequence recognition.  Binding is provided for
    the benefit of those where this doesn't apply.
[FORM] In form text fields, only.  Ignored by Line Editor elsewhere.


More notes

   When a text input field, including a textarea line, is selected,
   the Line Editor functions get a first grab at the keys entered.
   If a key has no function defined in the Line Editor binding, it
   can either be ignored, or passed on for normal key command handling,
   where modifiers like C-x or Meta currently have no effect (see the
   <A HREF="LYNXKEYMAP:"
   >Key Map Page</A> accessible with the key <kbd>K</kbd> for current information).
