  <h2><a name="GP" id="GP">General Preferences</a></h2>

  <h3><a name="UM" id="UM">User Mode</a></h3>

  <dl>
    <dt><em>Novice</em>: Shows 2 extra lines of help at the bottom
    of the screen for beginners.</dt>

    <dt><em>Intermediate (normal)</em>: Normal status-line messages
    appear.</dt>

    <dt><em>Advanced</em>: The URL is shown on the status
    line.</dt>
  </dl>

  <h3><a name="ED" id="ED">Editor</a></h3>

  <p>This is the editor to be invoked when editing browsable files,
  sending mail or comments, or filling form's textarea (multiline
  input field). The full pathname of the editor command should be
  specified when possible. It is assumed the text editor supports
  the same character set you have for "display character set" in
  Lynx.</p>

  <h3><a name="ST" id="ST">Type of Search</a></h3>

  <p>This allows you to tell Lynx whether to search the current
  document ignoring case (case insensistive) or not.</p>

  <h2><a name="SP" id="SP">Security and Privacy</a></h2>

  <h3><a name="CK" id="CK">Cookies</a></h3>

  <p>This can be set to accept or reject all cookies or to ask each
  time. See the Users Guide for details of <a href=
  "../Lynx_users_guide.html#Cookies">cookie usage</a>.</p>

  <h3><a name="IK" id="IK">Invalid-Cookie Prompting</a></h3>

  <p>This allows you to tell how to handle invalid cookies:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><em>prompt normally</em> to prompt for each cookie</li>

    <li><em>force yes-response</em> to reply "yes" to each
    prompt</li>

    <li><em>force no-response</em> to reply "no" to each
    prompt.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3><a name="SK" id="SK">SSL Prompting</a></h3>

  <p>This allows you to tell how to handle errors detected in SSL
  connections:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><em>prompt normally</em> to prompt for each cookie</li>

    <li><em>force yes-response</em> to reply "yes" to each
    prompt</li>

    <li><em>force no-response</em> to reply "no" to each
    prompt.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2><a name="KI" id="KI">Keyboard Input</a></h2>

  <h3><a name="KM" id="KM">Keypad mode</a></h3>

  <p>This gives the choice between navigating with the keypad (as
  arrows; see Lynx Navigation) and having every link numbered
  (numbered links) so that the links may be selected by numbers
  instead of moving to them with the arrow keys. You can also
  number form fields.</p>

  <h3><a name="EM" id="EM">Emacs keys</a></h3>

  <p>If set to 'ON' then the CTRL-P, CTRL-N, CTRL-F and CTRL-B keys
  will be mapped to up-arrow, down-arrow, right-arrow and
  left-arrow respectively. Otherwise, they remain mapped to their
  configured bindings (normally UP_TWO lines, DOWN_TWO lines,
  NEXT_PAGE and PREV_PAGE respectively).</p>

  <p>Note: setting emacs keys does not affect the line-editor
  bindings.</p>

  <h3><a name="VI" id="VI">VI keys</a></h3>

  <p>If set to 'ON' then the lowercase h, j, k and l keys will be
  mapped to left-arrow, down-arrow, up-arrow and right-arrow
  respectively.</p>

  <p>The uppercase H, J, K, and L keys remain mapped to their
  configured bindings (normally HELP, JUMP, KEYMAP and LIST,
  respectively).</p>

  <p>Note: setting vi keys does not affect the line-editor
  bindings.</p>

  <h3><a name="LE" id="LE">Line edit style</a></h3>

  <p>This allows you to set alternate key bindings for the built-in
  line editor, if <a href="alt_edit_help.html">Alternate
  Bindings</a> have been installed. Otherwise, Lynx uses the
  <a href="edit_help.html">Default Binding</a>.</p>

  <h2><a name="DP" id="DP">Display and Character Set</a></h2>

  <h3><a name="LC" id="LC">Use locale-based character set</a></h3>

  <p>This option allows you to request lynx to obtain a MIME name
  from the operating system which corresponds to your locale
  setting. If successful, it overrides the normal setting of the
  display character set.</p>

  <h3><a name="H5" id="H5">Use HTML5 charset replacements</a></h3>

  <p>This option allows lynx to treat pages with ISO-8859-1
  (Latin1) or ASCII encoding as if they were Windows 1252. That
  allows a few punctuation characters to be shown.</p>

  <h3><a name="DC" id="DC">Display Character set</a></h3>

  <p>This allows you to set up the default character set for your
  specific terminal. The display character set provides a mapping
  from the character encodings of viewed documents and from HTML
  entities into viewable characters. It should be set according to
  your terminal's character set so that characters other than 7-bit
  ASCII can be displayed correctly, using approximations if
  necessary, <a href="test_display.html">try the test here</a>.</p>

  <h3><a name="AD" id="AD">Assumed document character set</a></h3>

  <p>This changes the handling of documents which do not explicitly
  specify a charset. Normally Lynx assumes that 8-bit characters in
  those documents are encoded according to iso-8859-1 (the official
  default for HTTP protocol). Unfortunately, many non-English web
  pages forget to include proper charset info; this option helps
  you browse those broken pages if you know somehow what the
  charset is. When the value given here or by an -assume_charset
  command-line flag is in effect, Lynx will treat documents as if
  they were encoded accordingly. Option is active when 'Raw 8-bit
  or CJK Mode' is OFF.</p>

  <h3><a name="JK" id="JK">Raw 8-bit or CJK mode</a></h3>

  <p>This is set automatically, but can be toggled manually in
  certain cases: it toggles whether 8-bit characters are assumed to
  correspond with the display character set and therefore are
  processed without translation via the chartrans conversion
  tables. ON by default when the display character set is one of
  the Asian (CJK) sets and the 8-bit characters are Kanji
  multibytes. OFF for the other display character sets, but can be
  turned ON when the document's charset is unknown (e.g., is not
  ISO-8859-1 and no charset parameter was specified in a reply
  header from an HTTP server to indicate what it is), but you have
  no better idea than viewing it as from display character set (see
  'assumed document character set' for best choice). Should be OFF
  when an Asian (CJK) set is selected but the document is
  ISO-8859-1 or another 'assumed document character set'. The
  setting can also be toggled via the RAW_TOGGLE command, normally
  mapped to '@@', and at startup via the -raw switch.</p>

  <h3><a name="DV" id="DV">X DISPLAY variable</a></h3>

  <p>This option is only relevant to X Window users. It specifies
  the DISPLAY (Unix) or DECW$DISPLAY (VMS) variable. It is picked
  up automatically from the environment if it has been previously
  set.</p>

  <h2><a name="AP" id="AP">Document Appearance</a></h2>

  <h3><a name="SC" id="SC">Show color</a></h3>

  <p>This will be present if color support is available.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>If set to ON or ALWAYS, color mode will be forced on if
    possible. If (n)curses color support is available but cannot be
    used for the current terminal type, selecting ON is rejected
    with a message.</li>

    <li>If set to OFF or NEVER, color mode will be turned off.</li>

    <li>ALWAYS and NEVER are not offered in anonymous accounts. If
    saved to a '.lynxrc' file in non-anonymous accounts, ALWAYS
    will cause Lynx to set color mode on at startup if
    supported.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>If Lynx is built with slang, this is equivalent to having
  included the -color command line switch or having the COLORTERM
  environment variable set. If color support is provided by curses
  or ncurses, this is equivalent to the default behavior of using
  color when the terminal type supports it. If (n)curses color
  support is available but cannot be used for the current terminal
  type, the preference can still be saved but will have no
  effect.</p>

  <p>A saved value of NEVER will cause Lynx to assume a monochrome
  terminal at start-up. It is similar to the -nocolor switch, but
  (when the slang library is used) can be overridden with the
  -color switch. If the setting is OFF or ON when the current
  options are saved to a '.lynxrc' file, the default start-up
  behavior is retained, such that color mode will be turned on at
  startup only if the terminal info indicates that you have a
  color-capable terminal, or (when slang is used) if forced on via
  the -color switch or COLORTERM variable. This default behavior
  always is used in anonymous accounts, or if the 'option'_save
  restriction is set explicitly. If for any reason the start-up
  color mode is incorrect for your terminal, set it appropriately
  on or off via this option.</p>

  <h3><a name="CS" id="CS">Color style</a></h3>

  <p>At startup, Lynx identifies the available color-style
  configuration files in the same directory as its default ".lss"
  file. At runtime, you can switch between these files using this
  options-menu feature.</p>

  <h3><a name="C0" id="C0">Default colors</a></h3>

  <p>Depending on the default foreground and background colors
  which your terminal uses, some color-styles would look better if
  Lynx did not use those in combination with the style for the
  background. Use this option to enable/disable the default-color
  feature.</p>

  <h3><a name="CL" id="CL">Show cursor for current link or
  option</a></h3>

  <p>Lynx normally hides the cursor by positioning it to the right
  and if possible the very bottom of the screen, so that the
  current link or OPTION is indicated solely by its highlighting or
  color. If show cursor is set to ON, the cursor will be positioned
  at the left of the current link or OPTION. This is helpful when
  Lynx is being used with a speech or braille interface. It is also
  useful for sighted users when the terminal cannot distinguish the
  character attributes used to distinguish the current link or
  OPTION from the others in the display.</p>

  <h3><a name="UK" id="UK">Underline links</a></h3>

  <p>Use underline-attribute rather than bold for links.</p>

  <h3><a name="SS" id="SS">Show scrollbar</a></h3>

  <p>This allows you to enable (show) or disable (hide) the
  scrollbar on the right-margin of the display. This feature is
  available with ncurses or slang libraries.</p>

  <h3><a name="PU" id="PU">Pop-ups for select fields</a></h3>

  <p>Lynx normally uses a pop-up window for the OPTIONs in form
  SELECT fields when the field does not have the MULTIPLE attribute
  specified, and thus only one OPTION can be selected. The use of
  pop-up windows can be disabled by changing this setting to OFF,
  in which case the OPTIONs will be rendered as a list of radio
  buttons. Note that if the SELECT field does have the MULTIPLE
  attribute specified, the OPTIONs always are rendered as a list of
  checkboxes.</p>

  <h3><a name="tagsoup" id="tagsoup">HTML error recovery</a></h3>

  <p>Lynx often has to deal with invalid HTML markup. It always
  tries to recover from errors, but there is no universally correct
  way for doing this. As a result, there are two parsing modes:
  "<dfn>SortaSGML</dfn>" attempts to enforce valid nesting of most
  tags at an earlier stage of processing, while
  "<dfn>TagSoup</dfn>" relies more on the HTML rendering stage to
  mimic the behavior of some other browsers. You can also switch
  between these modes with the CTRL-V key, and the default can be
  changed in lynx.cfg or with the -tagsoup command line switch.</p>

  <p>The "SortaSGML" mode will often appear to be more strict, and
  makes some errors apparent that are otherwise unnoticeable. One
  particular difference is the handling of block elements or
  &lt;li&gt;..&lt;/li&gt; inside &lt;a
  HREF="some.url"&gt;..&lt;/a&gt;. Invalid nesting like this may
  turn anchors into hidden links which cannot be easily followed,
  this is avoided in "TagSoup" mode. See the <a href=
  "follow_help.html">help on following links by number</a> for more
  information on hidden links. Often pages may be more readable in
  "TagSoup" mode, but sometimes the opposite is true. Most
  documents with valid HTML, and documents with only minor errors,
  should be rendered the same way in both modes.</p>

  <p>If you are curious about what goes on behind the scenes, but
  find that the information from the -trace switch is just too
  much, Lynx can be started with the -preparsed switch; going into
  SOURCE mode ('\' key) and toggling the parsing mode (with CTRL-V)
  should then show some of the differences.</p>

  <h3><a name="BH" id="BH">Bad HTML messages</a></h3>

  <p>Suppress or redirect Lynx's messages about "Bad HTML":</p>

  <dl>
    <dt>Ignore</dt>

    <dd>do not warn; no details are written to the trace-file.</dd>

    <dt>Add to trace-file</dt>

    <dd>add the detailed warning message to the trace-file.</dd>

    <dt>Add to LYNXMESSAGES</dt>

    <dd>add the detailed warning message to the message page at
    "LYNXMESSAGES:".</dd>

    <dt>Warn, point to trace-file</dt>

    <dd>show a warning message on the status line; the complete
    message is written to the trace-file.</dd>
  </dl>

  <h3><a name="SI" id="SI">Show Images</a></h3>

  <p>This option combines the effects of the `*' &amp; `[' keys as
  follows:</p>
  <pre>
     <em>ignore</em> all images which lack an ALT= text string,
     <em>show labels</em>, e.g. [INLINE] &mdash; see `Verbose Images' below &mdash; ,
     <em>use links</em> for every image, enabling downloading.
</pre>

  <p>This option setting cannot be saved between sessions. See
  <a href="../Lynx_users_guide.html#Images">Users Guide</a> &amp;
  <em>lynx.cfg</em> for more details.</p>

  <h3><a name="VB" id="VB">Verbose Images</a></h3>

  <p>This allows you to replace [LINK], [INLINE] and [IMAGE]
  &mdash; for images without ALT &mdash; with filenames: this can
  be helpful by revealing which images are important &amp; which
  are merely decoration, e.g. <em>button.gif</em>,
  <em>line.gif</em>. See <a href=
  "../Lynx_users_guide.html#Images">Users Guide</a> &amp;
  <em>lynx.cfg</em> for more details.</p>

  <h2><a name="HP" id="HP">Headers Transferred to Remote
  Servers</a></h2>

  <h3><a name="PM" id="PM">Personal Mail Address</a></h3>

  <p>You may set your mail address here so that when mailing
  messages to other people or mailing files to yourself, your email
  address can be automatically filled in. Your email address will
  also be sent to HTTP servers in a `from:' field.</p>

  <h3><a name="PN" id="PN">Personal mail name</a></h3>

  <p>This mail name will be included as the "X-Personal_Name" field
  in any mail or comments that you send if that header has not been
  disabled via the NO_ANONYMOUS_EMAIL definition in
  <em>lynx.cfg</em>.</p>

  <h3><a name="PW" id="PW">Password for anonymous ftp</a></h3>

  <p>If this is blank, Lynx will use your personal mail address as
  the anonymous ftp password. Though that is the convention, some
  users prefer to use some other string which provides less
  information. If the given value lacks a "@@", Lynx also will use
  your computer's hostname as part of the password. If both this
  field and the personal mail address are blank, Lynx will use your
  $USER environment variable, or "WWWuser" if even the environment
  variable is unset.</p>

  <h3><a name="PT" id="PT">Preferred media type</a></h3>

  <p>When doing a GET, lynx lists the MIME types which it knows how
  to present (the "Accept:" string). Depending on your system
  configuration, the mime.types or other data given by the
  GLOBAL_EXTENSION_MAP may include many entries that lynx really
  does not handle. Use this option to select one of the built-in
  subsets of the MIME types that lynx could list in the Accept.</p>

  <dl>
    <dt>Accept lynx's internal types</dt>

    <dd>list only the types that are compiled into lynx.</dd>

    <dt>Also accept lynx.cfg's types</dt>

    <dd>lists types defined in lynx.cfg, e.g., the VIEWER and Cern
    RULE or RULESFILE settings.</dd>

    <dt>Also accept user's types</dt>

    <dd>lists types from the PERSONAL_EXTENSION_MAP setting in
    lynx.cfg</dd>

    <dt>Also accept system's types</dt>

    <dd>lists types from the GLOBAL_EXTENSION_MAP setting in
    lynx.cfg</dd>

    <dt>Accept all types</dt>

    <dd>adds the types that are in lynx's built-in tables for
    external programs that may be used to present a document.</dd>
  </dl>

  <h3><a name="PE" id="PE">Preferred encoding</a></h3>

  <p>When doing a GET, lynx tells what types of compressed data it
  can decompress (the "Accept-Encoding:" string). This is
  determined by compiled-in support for decompression or external
  decompression programs. Use this option to select none, one or
  all of the supported decompression types.</p>

  <h3><a name="PC" id="PC">Preferred Document Charset</a></h3>

  <p>The character set you prefer if sets in addition to ISO-8859-1
  and US-ASCII are available from servers. Use MIME notation (e.g.,
  ISO-8859-2) and do not include ISO-8859-1 or US-ASCII, since
  those values are always assumed by default. Can be a
  comma-separated list, which may be interpreted by servers as
  descending order of preferences; you can make your order of
  preference explicit by using `q factors' as defined by the HTTP
  protocol, for servers which understand it: e.g., <kbd>iso-8859-5,
  utf-8;q=0.8</kbd>.</p>

  <h3><a name="PL" id="PL">Preferred Document Language</a></h3>

  <p>The language you prefer if multi-language files are available
  from servers. Use RFC 1766 tags, e.g., `en' English, `fr' French.
  Can be a comma-separated list, and you can use `q factors' (see
  previous help item): e.g., <kbd>da, en-gb;q=0.8, en;q=0.7</kbd>
  .</p>

  <h3><a name="SA" id="SA">Send User-Agent header</a></h3>

  <p>This controls whether the user-agent string will be sent.</p>

  <h3><a name="UA" id="UA">User Agent header</a></h3>

  <p>The header string which Lynx sends to servers to indicate the
  User-Agent is displayed here. Changes may be disallowed via the
  -restrictions switch. Otherwise, the header can be changed
  temporarily to e.g., L_y_n_x/2.8.3 for access to sites which
  discriminate against Lynx based on checks for the presence of
  `Lynx' in the header. If changed during a Lynx session, the
  default User-Agent header can be restored by deleting the
  modified string in the Options Menu. Whenever the User-Agent
  header is changed, the current document is reloaded, with the
  no-cache flags set, on exit from Options Menu. Changes of the
  header are not saved in the .lynxrc file.</p>

  <p>Caveat: Netscape Communications Corp. (for example) claimed
  that false transmissions of `Mozilla' as the User-Agent are a
  copyright infringement, which would be prosecuted. The
  <em>Options Menu</em> issues a warning about possible copyright
  infringement whenever the header is changed to one which does not
  include <strong>Lynx</strong> or <strong>lynx</strong>.</p>

  <h2><a name="LP" id="LP">Listing and Accessing Files</a></h2>

  <h3><a name="PF" id="PF">Use Passive FTP</a></h3>

  <p>This allows you to change whether Lynx uses passive ftp
  connections.</p>

  <h3><a name="FT" id="FT">FTP sort criteria</a></h3>

  <p>This allows you to specify how files will be sorted within FTP
  listings. The current options include `By&nbsp;Filename',
  `By&nbsp;Size', `By&nbsp;Type', `By&nbsp;Date'.</p>

  <h3><a name="LD" id="LD">List directory style</a></h3>

  <p>Applies to Directory Editing. Files and directories can be
  presented in the following ways:</p>

  <dl>
    <dt><em>Mixed style</em>: Files and directories are listed
    together in alphabetical order.</dt>

    <dt><em>Directories first</em>: Files and directories are
    separated into 2 alphabetical lists: directories are listed
    first.</dt>

    <dt><em>Files first</em>: Files and directories are separated
    into 2 alphabetical lists: files are listed first.</dt>
  </dl>

  <h3><a name="LO" id="LO">Local directory sort order</a></h3>

  <p>Lynx also allows you to sort by the file attributes:</p>

  <dl>
    <dt>By name</dt>

    <dd>by filename (the default)</dd>

    <dt>By size</dt>

    <dd>by file size, in descending order</dd>

    <dt>By date</dt>

    <dd>by file modification time, in descending order</dd>

    <dt>By mode</dt>

    <dd>by file protection</dd>

    <dt>By type</dt>

    <dd>by filename suffix, e.g., the text beginning with '.'</dd>

    <dt>By user</dt>

    <dd>by file owner's user-id</dd>

    <dt>By group</dt>

    <dd>by file owner's group-id</dd>
  </dl>

  <h3><a name="DF" id="DF">Show dot files</a></h3>

  <p>If display/creation of hidden (dot) files/directories is
  enabled, you can turn the feature on or off via this setting.</p>

  <h3><a name="PZ" id="PZ">Pause when showing message</a></h3>

  <p>If set to "off", this overrides the INFOSECS setting in
  lynx.cfg, to eliminate pauses when displaying informational
  messages, like the "-nopause" command line option.</p>

  <h3><a name="LL" id="LL">Execution links</a></h3>

  <p>If set to 'ALWAYS ON', Lynx will locally execute commands
  contained inside any links. This can be HIGHLY DANGEROUS, so it
  is recommended that they remain 'ALWAYS OFF' or 'FOR LOCAL FILES
  ONLY'.</p>

  <h3><a name="TX" id="TX">Show transfer rate</a></h3>

  <p>This allows you to select the way in which Lynx shows its
  progress in downloading large pages. It displays its progress in
  the status line. These are the available selections:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Do not show rate</li>

    <li>Local directory sort order</li>

    <li>Show dot files</li>

    <li>Execution links</li>

    <li>Pause when showing message</li>

    <li>Show transfer rate</li>
  </ul>

  <h3><a name="MB" id="MB">Multi-bookmarks</a></h3>

  <p>Manage multiple bookmark files:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>When OFF, the default bookmark file is used for the
    'v'iew-bookmarks and 'a'dd-bookmark link commands.</li>

    <li>If set to STANDARD, a menu of available bookmarks is always
    invoked when you seek to view a bookmark file or add a link,
    and you select the bookmark file by its letter token in that
    menu.</li>

    <li>If set to ADVANCED, you are instead prompted for the letter
    of the desired bookmark file, but can enter '=' to invoke the
    STANDARD selection menu, or RETURN for the default bookmark
    file.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3><a name="BF" id="BF">Bookmark file</a></h3>

  <p>Manage the default bookmark file:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>If non-empty and multi-bookmarks is OFF, it specifies your
    default '<a href="bookmark_help.html">Bookmark file</a>'.</li>

    <li>If multi-bookmarks is STANDARD or ADVANCED, entering 'B'
    will invoke a menu in which you can specify filepaths and
    descriptions of up to 26 bookmark files.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The filepaths must be from your home directory and begin with
  './' if subdirectories are included (e.g.,
  './BM/lynx_bookmarks.html').</p>

  <p>Lynx will create bookmark files when you first 'a'dd a link,
  but any subdirectories in the filepath must already exist.</p>

  <h3><a name="AZ" id="AZ">Auto Session</a></h3>

  <p>Lynx can save and restore useful information about your
  browsing history. Use this setting to enable or disable the
  feature.</p>

  <h3><a name="SZ" id="SZ">Session file</a></h3>

  <p>Define the file name where lynx will store user sessions. This
  setting is used only when <em>Auto Session</em> is enabled.</p>

  <h3><a name="VP" id="VP">Visited Pages</a></h3>

  <p>This allows you to change the appearance of the <a href=
  "visited_help.html">Visited Links Page</a> Normally it shows a
  list, in reverse order of the pages visited. The popup menu
  allows you these choices:</p>

  <dl>
    <dt><em>By First Visit</em>: The default appearance, shows the
    pages based on when they were first visited. The list is shown
    in reverse order, to make the current page (usually) at the top
    of the list.</dt>

    <dt><em>By First Visit Reversed</em> The default appearance,
    shows the pages based on when they were first visited. The list
    is shown in order, to make the current page (usually) at the
    bottom of the list.</dt>

    <dt><em>As Visit Tree</em> Combines the first/last visited
    information, showing the list in order of the first visit, but
    using the indentation level of the page immediately previous to
    determine indentation of new entries. That gives a clue to the
    order of visiting pages when moving around in the History or
    Visited Pages lists.</dt>

    <dt><em>By Last Visit</em> The default appearance, shows the
    pages based on when they were last visited. The list is shown
    in reverse order, to make the current page (usually) at the top
    of the list.</dt>

    <dt><em>By Last Visit Reversed</em> The default appearance,
    shows the pages based on when they were last visited. The list

<H1><A NAME="CK">Cookies</A></H1>

This can be set to accept or reject all cookies or to ask each time.
See the Users Guide for details of <A HREF="../Lynx_users_guide.html#Cookies"
>cookie usage</A>.

<H1><A NAME="ED">Editor</A></H1>

This is the editor to be invoked when editing browsable files,
sending mail or comments, or filling form's textarea (multiline input field).
The full pathname of the editor command should be specified when possible.
It is assumed the text editor supports the same character set
you have for "display character set" in Lynx.

<H1><A NAME="EM">Emacs keys</A></H1>

If set to 'ON' then the CTRL-P, CTRL-N, CTRL-F and CTRL-B keys will be mapped
to up-arrow, down-arrow, right-arrow and left-arrow respectively.  Otherwise,
they remain mapped to their configured bindings (normally UP_TWO lines,
DOWN_TWO lines, NEXT_PAGE and PREV_PAGE respectively).
<p>Note: setting emacs keys does not affect the line-editor bindings.

<H1><A NAME="LL">Execution links</A></H1>

If set to 'ALWAYS ON', Lynx will locally execute commands contained
inside any links.  This can be HIGHLY DANGEROUS, so it is recommended
that they remain 'ALWAYS OFF' or 'FOR LOCAL FILES ONLY'.

<H1><A NAME="KM">Keypad mode</A></H1>

This gives the choice between navigating with the keypad (as arrows;
see Lynx Navigation) and having every link numbered (numbered links)
so that the links may be selected by numbers instead of moving to them
with the arrow keys.  You can also number form fields.

<H1><A NAME="LE">Line edit style</A></H1>

This allows you to set alternate key bindings for the built-in line editor,
if <A HREF="alt_edit_help.html">Alternate Bindings</A> have been installed.
Otherwise, Lynx uses the <A HREF="edit_help.html">Default Binding</A>.

<H1><A NAME="PM">Personal Mail Address</A></H1>

You may set your mail address here so that when mailing messages
to other people or mailing files to yourself, your email address can be
automatically filled in.  Your email address will also be sent
to HTTP servers in a `from:' field.

<H1><A NAME="PU">Pop-ups for select fields</A></H1>

Lynx normally uses a pop-up window for the OPTIONs in form SELECT fields
when the field does not have the MULTIPLE attribute specified, and thus
only one OPTION can be selected.  The use of pop-up windows can be disabled
by changing this setting to OFF, in which case the OPTIONs will be rendered
as a list of radio buttons.  Note that if the SELECT field does have
the MULTIPLE attribute specified, the OPTIONs always are rendered
as a list of checkboxes.

<H1><A NAME="ST">Searching type</A></H1>

If set to 'case sensitive', user searches invoked by  '/'  will be
case-sensitive substring searches.  Default is 'Case Insensitive'.

<H1><A NAME="SC">Show color</A></H1>

This will be present if color support is available.
<ul>
<li>If set to ON or ALWAYS,
color mode will be forced on if possible.  If (n)curses color support
is available but cannot be used for the current terminal type, selecting ON
is rejected with a message.
<li>If set to OFF or NEVER, color mode will be
turned off.
<li>ALWAYS and NEVER are not offered in anonymous accounts.
If saved to a '.lynxrc' file in non-anonymous accounts, ALWAYS will cause Lynx
to set color mode on at startup if supported.
</ul>
If Lynx is built with slang,
this is equivalent to having included the -color command line switch
or having the COLORTERM environment variable set.  If color support is
provided by curses or ncurses, this is equivalent to the default behavior
of using color when the terminal type supports it.  If (n)curses color support
is available but cannot be used for the current terminal type, the preference
can still be saved but will have no effect.

<p>A saved value of NEVER will
cause Lynx to assume a monochrome terminal at start-up.  It is similar
to the -nocolor switch, but (when the slang library is used) can be overridden
with the -color switch.  If the setting is OFF or ON when the current options
are saved to a '.lynxrc' file, the default start-up behavior is retained,
such that color mode will be turned on at startup only if the terminal info
indicates that you have a color-capable terminal, or (when slang is used)
if forced on via the -color switch or COLORTERM variable.  This default
behavior always is used in anonymous accounts, or if the 'option'_save
restriction is set explicitly.  If for any reason the start-up color mode
is incorrect for your terminal, set it appropriately on or off via this option.

<H1><A NAME="CL">Show cursor for current link or option</A></H1>

Lynx normally hides the cursor by positioning it to the right and if possible
the very bottom of the screen, so that the current link or OPTION is indicated
solely by its highlighting or color.  If show cursor is set to ON, the cursor
will be positioned at the left of the current link or OPTION.  This is helpful
when Lynx is being used with a speech or braille interface.  It is also useful
for sighted users when the terminal cannot distinguish the character attributes
used to distinguish the current link or OPTION from the others in the display.

<H1><A NAME="UM">User Mode</A></H1>

<dl>
<dt><EM>Novice</EM>: Shows 2 extra lines of help at the bottom of the screen
for beginners.
<dt><EM>Intermediate (normal)</EM>: Normal status-line messages appear.
<dt><EM>Advanced</EM>: The URL is shown on the status line.
</dl>

<H1><A NAME="AD">Assumed document character set</A></H1>

This changes the handling of documents which do not explicitly specify
a charset.  Normally Lynx assumes that 8-bit characters in those documents
are encoded according to iso-8859-1 (the official default for HTTP protocol).
Unfortunately, many non-English web pages forget to include proper charset
info; this option helps you browse those broken pages if you know somehow
what the charset is.  When the value given here or by an -assume_charset
command-line flag is in effect, Lynx will treat documents as if they were
encoded accordingly.  Option is active when 'Raw 8-bit or CJK Mode' is OFF.

<H1><A NAME="JK">Raw 8-bit or CJK mode</A></H1>

This is set automatically, but can be toggled manually in certain cases:
it toggles whether 8-bit characters are assumed to correspond with the display
character set and therefore are processed without translation
via the chartrans conversion tables.  ON by default when the display
character set is one of the Asian (CJK) sets and the 8-bit characters
are Kanji multibytes.  OFF for the other display character sets,
but can be turned ON when the document's charset is unknown
(e.g., is not ISO-8859-1 and no charset parameter was specified
in a reply header from an HTTP server to indicate what it is),
but you have no better idea than viewing it as from display character set
(see 'assumed document character set' for best choice).  Should be OFF
when an Asian (CJK) set is selected but the document is ISO-8859-1
or another 'assumed document character set'.  The setting can also be toggled
via the RAW_TOGGLE command, normally mapped to '@@', and at startup
via the -raw switch.

<H1><A NAME="tagsoup">HTML error recovery</A></H1>

Lynx often has to deal with invalid HTML markup.  It always tries to
recover from errors, but there is no universally correct way for doing
this.  As a result, there are two parsing modes:
"<DFN>SortaSGML</DFN>" attempts to enforce valid nesting of most tags
at an earlier stage of processing, while "<DFN>TagSoup</DFN>" relies
more on the HTML rendering stage to mimic the behavior of some other
browsers.
You can also switch between these modes with the CTRL-V key, and the
default can be changed in lynx.cfg or with the -tagsoup command line
switch.

<P>
The "SortaSGML" mode will often appear to be more strict, and makes
some errors apparent that are otherwise unnoticeable.  One particular
difference is the handling of block elements or
&lt;li&gt;..&lt;/li&gt; inside &lt;a HREF="some.url"&gt;..&lt;/a&gt;.
Invalid nesting like this may turn anchors into hidden links which
cannot be easily followed, this is avoided in "TagSoup" mode.  See the
<a href="follow_help.html">help on following links by
number</a> for more information on hidden links.  Often pages may be
more readable in "TagSoup" mode, but sometimes the opposite is true.
Most documents with valid HTML, and documents with only minor errors,
should be rendered the same way in both modes.

<P>
If you are curious about what goes on behind the scenes, but find that
the information from the -trace switch is just too much, Lynx can be
started with the -preparsed switch; going into SOURCE mode ('\' key)
and toggling the parsing mode (with CTRL-V) should then show some of
the differences.

<!--
LP's version - for reference - TD

While the proper HTML markup should be canonical, badly nested HTML pages
may be recovered in different ways.  There are two error recovery modes
in Lynx: SortaSGML with the recovery at SGML stage and TagSoup mode
with the recovery at HTML parsing stage, the latter gives more
recovery and was the default in Lynx 2.7.2 and before,
and the first may be useful for page validation purposes.
One particular difference is known for &lt;li&gt;..&lt;/li&gt;
or similar strong markup inside &lt;a HREF="some.url"&gt;..&lt;/a&gt;
anchor text - those links are not reachable in SortaSGML
(such markup should be placed outside &lt;a&gt;..&lt;/a&gt; indeed).
Default recovery mode can also be switched with CTRL-V key,
from lynx.cfg or command line switch.

<H1><A NAME="SI">Show Images</A></H1>
d17 480
a496 2
This option combines the effects of the `*' &amp; `[' keys as follows:
<pre>
d498 1
a498 1
     <em>show labels</em>, e.g. [INLINE] -- see `Verbose Images' below -- ,
d500 308
a807 163

This option setting cannot be saved between sessions.
See <A HREF="../Lynx_users_guide.html#Images">Users Guide</A>
&amp; <em>lynx.cfg</em> for more details.

<H1><A NAME="VB">Verbose Images</A></H1>

This allows you to replace [LINK], [INLINE] and [IMAGE]
-- for images without ALT -- with filenames:
this can be helpful by revealing which images are important
&amp; which are merely decoration, e.g. <em>button.gif</em>, <em>line.gif</em>.
See <A HREF="../Lynx_users_guide.html#Images">Users Guide</A>
&amp; <em>lynx.cfg</em> for more details.


<H1><A NAME="VI">VI keys</A></H1>

If set to 'ON' then the lowercase h, j, k and l keys will be mapped
to left-arrow, down-arrow, up-arrow and right-arrow respectively.
<p>The uppercase H, J, K, and L keys remain mapped to their configured bindings
(normally HELP, JUMP, KEYMAP and LIST, respectively).
<p>Note: setting vi keys does not affect the line-editor bindings.

<H1><A NAME="DC">Display Character set</A></H1>

This allows you to set up the default character set for your specific terminal.
The display character set provides a mapping from the character encodings
of viewed documents and from HTML entities into viewable characters.
It should be set according to your terminal's character set
so that characters other than 7-bit ASCII can be displayed correctly,
using approximations if necessary,
<A HREF="test_display.html">try the test here</A>.
Since Lynx now supports a wide range of platforms
it may be useful to note that cpXXX codepages are used within IBM PC computers,
and windows-xxxx within native MS-Windows applications.

<H1><A NAME="DV">X DISPLAY variable</A></H1>

This option is only relevant to X Window users. It specifies
the DISPLAY (Unix) or DECW$DISPLAY (VMS) variable.  It is picked up
automatically from the environment if it has been previously set.

<H1><A NAME="MB">Multi-bookmarks</A></H1>

Manage multiple bookmark files:
<ul>
<li>When OFF, the default bookmark file is used for the 'v'iew-bookmarks
and 'a'dd-bookmark link commands.
<li>If set to STANDARD, a menu of available
bookmarks is always invoked when you seek to view a bookmark file
or add a link, and you select the bookmark file by its letter token
in that menu.
<li>If set to ADVANCED, you are instead prompted for the letter
of the desired bookmark file, but can enter '=' to invoke the STANDARD
selection menu, or RETURN for the default bookmark file.
</ul>

<H1><A NAME="BF">Bookmark file</A></H1>

Manage the default bookmark file:
<ul>
<li>If non-empty and multi-bookmarks is OFF,
it specifies your default '<A HREF="bookmark_help.html">Bookmark file</A>'.
<li>If multi-bookmarks is STANDARD or ADVANCED,
entering 'B' will invoke a menu in which you can specify
filepaths and descriptions of up to 26 bookmark files.
</ul>
The filepaths must be from your home directory and begin with  './'
if subdirectories are included (e.g., './BM/lynx_bookmarks.html').
<P>
Lynx will create bookmark files when you first 'a'dd a link,
but any subdirectories in the filepath must already exist.

<H1><A NAME="VP">Visited Pages</A></H1>

This allows you to change the appearance of the
<a href="visited_help.html">Visited Links Page</a>

Normally it shows a list, in reverse order of the pages visited.
The popup menu allows you these choices:
<dl>
<dt><EM>By First Visit</EM>:
The default appearance, shows the pages based on when they were first visited.
The list is shown in reverse order, to make the current page (usually) at
the top of the list.
<dt><EM>By First Visit Reversed</EM>
The default appearance, shows the pages based on when they were first visited.
The list is shown in order, to make the current page (usually) at
the bottom of the list.
<dt><EM>As Visit Tree</EM>
Combines the first/last visited information, showing the list in order of
the first visit, but using the indentation level of the page immediately
previous to determine indentation of new entries.
That gives a clue to the order of visiting pages when moving around in
the History or Visited Pages lists.
<dt><EM>By Last Visit</EM>
The default appearance, shows the pages based on when they were last visited.
The list is shown in reverse order, to make the current page (usually) at
the top of the list.
<dt><EM>By Last Visit Reversed</EM>
The default appearance, shows the pages based on when they were last visited.
The list is shown in order, to make the current page (usually) at
the bottom of the list.
</dl>

<H1><A NAME="FT">FTP sort criteria</A></H1>

This allows you to specify how files will be sorted within FTP listings.
The current options include
`By&nbsp;Filename', `By&nbsp;Size', `By&nbsp;Type', `By&nbsp;Date'.

<H1><A NAME="LD">List directory style</A></H1>

Applies to Directory Editing.
Files and directories can be presented in the following ways:
<dl>
<dt><EM>Mixed style</EM>: Files and directories are listed together
in alphabetical order.
<dt><EM>Directories first</EM>: Files and directories are separated
into 2 alphabetical lists: directories are listed first.
<dt><EM>Files first</EM>: Files and directories are separated
into 2 alphabetical lists: files are listed first.
</dl>

<H1><A NAME="DF">Show dot files</A></H1>

If display/creation of hidden (dot) files/directories is enabled,
you can turn the feature on or off via this setting.

<H1><A NAME="PC">Preferred Document Charset</A></H1>

The character set you prefer if sets in addition to ISO-8859-1 and US-ASCII
are available from servers.  Use MIME notation (e.g., ISO-8859-2)
and do not include ISO-8859-1 or US-ASCII, since those values are always
assumed by default.  Can be a comma-separated list, which may be interpreted
by servers as descending order of preferences; you can make your order
of preference explicit by using `q factors' as defined by the HTTP protocol,
for servers which understand it: e.g., <kbd>iso-8859-5, utf-8;q=0.8</kbd>.

<H1><A NAME="PL">Preferred Document Language</A></H1>

The language you prefer if multi-language files are available from servers.
Use RFC 1766 tags, e.g., `en' English, `fr' French.  Can be a comma-separated
list, and you can use `q factors' (see previous help item):
e.g., <kbd>da, en-gb;q=0.8, en;q=0.7</kbd> .

<H1><A NAME="UA">User Agent</A></H1>

The header string which Lynx sends to servers to indicate the User-Agent
is displayed here.  Changes may be disallowed via the -restrictions switch.
Otherwise, the header can be changed temporarily to e.g., L_y_n_x/2.8.3
for access to sites which discriminate against Lynx based on checks
for the presence of `Lynx' in the header.  If changed during a Lynx session,
the default User-Agent header can be restored by deleting the modified string
in the Options Menu.  Whenever the User-Agent header is changed, the current
document is reloaded, with the no-cache flags set, on exit from Options Menu.
Changes of the header are not saved in the .lynxrc file.
<P>
NOTE Netscape Communications Corp. has claimed that false transmissions
of `Mozilla' as the User-Agent are a copyright infringement, which will
be prosecuted.  DO NOT misrepresent Lynx as Mozilla.  The Options Menu issues
a warning about possible copyright infringement whenever the header is changed
to one which does not include `Lynx' or `lynx'.

<h1>+++ Options Screen Help +++</h1>
<PRE>
        The Options Screen allows you to set and
        modify many of Lynx's features. The following
        options may be set.

     Editor             -  If non-empty it defines the editor to spawn
                           when editing a local file or sending mail.
			   Any valid text editor may be entered here.

     DISPLAY variable   -  If non-empty it specifies your <A HREF="xterm_help.html">X terminal</A>
                           display address.

     Multi-bookmarks    -  When OFF, the default bookmark file is used
                           for the 'v'iew bookmarks and 'a'dd bookmark
                           link commands.  If set to STANDARD, a menu
                           of available bookmarks always is invoked
                           when you seek to view a bookmark file or add
                           a link, and you select the bookmark file by
                           its letter token in that menu.  If set to
                           ADVANCED, you instead are prompted for the
                           letter of the desired bookmark file, but can
                           enter '=' to invoke the STANDARD selection
                           menu, or RETURN for the default bookmark file.

     Bookmark file      -  If non-empty and multi-bookmarks is OFF, it
                           specifies your default '<A HREF="bookmark_help.html">Bookmark file</A>'.
                           If multi-bookmarks is STANDARD or ADVANCED,
                           entering 'B' will invoke a menu in which you
                           can specify the filepaths and descriptions
                           of up to 26 bookmark files.  The filepaths
                           must be from your home directory, and begin
                           with dot-slash (./) if subdirectories are
                           included (e.g, ./BM/lynx_bookmarks.html).
                           Lynx will create bookmark files when you
                           first 'a'dd a link, but any subdirectories
                           in the filepath must already exist.

     FTP sort criteria  -  This option allows you to specify how files
                           will be sorted within FTP listings.  The
                           current options include "By Filename",
                           "By Size", "By Type", and "By Date".

     Personal Mail      -  You may set your mail address here so that
     Address               when mailing messages to other people or
                           mailing files to yourself, your email address
                           can be automatically filled in.  Your email
                           address will also be sent to HTTP servers in
                           a from: field.

     Searching type     -  If set to 'case sensitive', user searches
                           invoked by the '/' command will be case 
                           sensitive substring searches.  The
                           default is 'Case Insensitive' substring
                           searches

     Preferred Document -  The language you prefer if multi-language files
     Language              are available from servers.  Use RFC 1766 tags,
                           e.g., en for English, fr for French, etc.  Can be
                           a comma-separated list, which may be interpreted
			   by servers as descending order of preferences.
			   You can also make your order of preference explicit
			   by using q factors as defined by the HTTP protocol,
			   for servers which understand it, for example:
				<kbd>da, en-gb;q=0.8, en;q=0.7</kbd>

     Preferred Document -  The character set you prefer if sets in addition
     Charset               to ISO-8859-1 and US-ASCII are available from
                           servers.  Use MIME notation (e.g., ISO-8859-2)
                           and do not include ISO-8859-1 or US-ASCII, since
                           those values are always assumed by default.  Can
                           be a comma-separated list, which may be interpreted
			   by servers as descending order of preferences.
			   You can also make your order of preference explicit
			   by using q factors as defined by the HTTP protocol,
			   for servers which understand it, for example:
				<kbd>iso-8859-5, unicode-1-1;q=0.8</kbd>

     Display Character  -  This option allows you to set up the default
     set                   character set for your specific terminal.
                           The character set provides a mapping of 8-bit ISO
                           Latin character entities and/or Asian (CJK) or
                           Unicode characters into viewable characters and
                           should be set according to your terminal's
                           character set if you will be viewing such
                           characters with Lynx.  You must have the selected
                           character set installed on your terminal.

     Raw 8-bit or CJK   -  Toggles whether 8-bit characters are assumed to
     mode                  correspond with the selected character set and
                           therefore are processed without translation via
                           the chartrans conversion tables.  Should be ON
                           by default when the selected character set is one
                           of the Asian (CJK) sets and the 8-bit characters
                           are Kanji multibytes.  Should be OFF for the other
                           character sets, but can be turned ON when the
                           document's charset is unknown (e.g., is not
                           ISO-8859-1 and no charset parameter was included in
                           a reply header from an HTTP server to indicate what
                           it is) but you know by some means that you have the
                           matching display character set selected.  Should be
                           OFF when an Asian (CJK) set is selected but the
                           document is ISO-8859-1.  The setting also can be
                           toggled via the RAW_TOGGLE command, normally mapped
                           to '@@', and at startup via the -raw switch.

     Show color        -   This option will be present if color support is
                           available.  If set to ON or ALWAYS, color mode will
                           be forced on if possible.  If (n)curses color
                           support is available but cannot be used for the
                           current terminal type, selecting ON is rejected
                           with a message.  If set to OFF or NEVER, color mode
                           will be turned off.
                           ALWAYS and NEVER are not offered in anonymous
                           accounts.  If saved to a '.lynxrc' file in
                           non-anonymous accounts, ALWAYS will cause Lynx to
                           set color mode on at startup if supported.  If Lynx
                           is built with the slang library, this is equivalent
                           to having included the -color command line switch
                           or having the COLORTERM environment variable
                           set. If color support is provided by curses or
                           ncurses, this is equivalent to the default behavior
                           of using color when the terminal type supports it.
                           If (n)curses color support is available but cannot
                           be used for the current terminal type, the
                           preference can still be saved but will have no
                           effect.
                           A saved value of NEVER will cause Lynx to assume a
                           monochrome terminal at startup.  It is similar to
                           the -nocolor switch, but (when the slang library is
                           used) can be overridden with the -color switch.
                           If the setting is OFF or ON when the current
                           options are saved to a '.lynxrc' file, the default
                           startup behavior is retained, such that color mode
                           will be turned on at startup only if the terminal
                           info indicates that you have a color-capable
                           terminal, or (when the slang library is used) if
                           forced on via the -color switch or COLORTERM
                           variable.  This default behavior always is used in
                           anonymous accounts, or if the 'option'_save
                           restriction is set explicitly.  If for any reason
                           the startup color mode is incorrect for your
                           terminal, set it appropriately on or off via this
                           option.

     VI keys           -   If set to 'ON' then the lowercase h, j, k, and l,
                           keys will be mapped to left-arrow, down-arrow,
			   up-arrow, and right-arrow, respectively.  The
                           uppercase H, J, K, and L keys remain mapped to
                           their configured bindings (normally HELP, JUMP,
                           KEYMAP, and LIST, respectively).

     Emacs keys        -   If set to 'ON' then the CTRL-P, CTRL-N, CTRL-F, 
                           and CTRL-B keys will be mapped to up-arrow,
                           down-arrow, right-arrow,  and left-arrow,
                           respectively.  Otherwise, they remain mapped
                           to their configured bindings (normally UP_TWO
                           lines, DOWN_TWO lines, NEXT_PAGE, and PREV_PAGE,
                           respectively).

     Show dot files    -   If display/creation of hidden (dot)
                           files/directories is enabled, you can turn
                           the feature on or off via this setting.

     Popups for select -   Lynx normally uses a popup window for the
     fields                OPTIONs in form SELECT fields when the field
                           does not have the MULTIPLE attribute specified,
                           and thus only one OPTION can be selected.  The
                           use of popup windows can be disabled by changing
                           this setting to OFF, in which case the OPTIONs
                           will be rendered as a list of radio buttons.
                           Note that if the SELECT field does have the
                           MULTIPLE attribute specified, the OPTIONs always
                           are rendered as a list of checkboxes.

     Show cursor for   -   Lynx normally hides the cursor by positioning it
     current link or       to the right and if possible the very bottom of
     option                the screen, so that the current link or OPTION
                           is indicated solely by its highlighting or color.
                           If show cursor is set to ON, the cursor will be
	                   positioned at the left of the current link or
                           OPTION.  This is helpful when Lynx is being used
                           with a speech or braille interface.  It also is
                           useful for sighted users when the terminal cannot
                           distinguish the character attributes used to
                           distinguish the current link or OPTION from the
                           others in the screen display.

     Keypad mode       -   This option gives the choice between navigating 
                           with the keypad (as arrows; see Lynx Navigation)
                           and having every link numbered (numbered links)
			   so that the links may be selected by numbers
			   instead of moving to them with the arrow keys.

     Line edit style   -   This option allows you to set alternate key
                           bindings for the built-in line editor, if your
                           system administrator has installed alternates.
                           Otherwise, Lynx uses the <A HREF="edit_help.html">Default Binding</A>.

     List directory    -   Applies to Directory Editing.  Files and
     style                 directories can be presented in the following
                           ways:
                            Mixed style
                              Files and directories are listed together in
                              alphabetical order.
                            Directories first
                              Files and directories are separated into two
                              alphabetical lists.  Directories are listed
                              first.
                            Files first
                              Files and directories are separated into two
                              alphabetical lists.  Files are listed first.

     User Mode         -   Beginner 
                              Shows two extra lines of help at the bottom 
                              of the screen
                           Intermediate (normal mode) 
                              The "normal" statusline messages appear. 
                           Advanced 
                              The URL is shown on the statusline. 

      User Agent       -   The header string which Lynx sends to servers
                           to indicate the User-Agent is displayed here.
                           Changes may be disallowed via the -restrictions
                           switch.  Otherwise, the header can be changed
                           temporarily to a string such as L_y_n_x/2.7.2 for
                           access to sites which discriminate against Lynx
                           based on checks for the presence of "Lynx" in the
                           header. If changed during a Lynx session, the
                           default User-Agent header can be restored by
                           deleting the modified string in the Options Menu.
                           Whenever the User-Agent header is changed, the
                           current document is reloaded, with the no-cache
                           flags set, on exit from the Options Menu.  Changes
                           of the header are not saved in the RC file.
                           NOTE that Netscape Communications Corp. has
                           claimed that false transmissions of "Mozilla" as
                           the User-Agent are a copyright infringement, which
                           will be prosecuted.  DO NOT misrepresent Lynx as
                           Mozilla.  The Options Menu issues a warning about
                           possible copyright infringement whenever the header
                           is changed to one which does not include "Lynx" or
                           "lynx".

     Local execution   -   If set to 'ALWAYS ON', Lynx will locally execute
     links                 commands contained inside of any links.  This
                           can be HIGHLY DANGEROUS so it is recommended
                           that they remain 'ALWAYS OFF' or 'FOR LOCAL
                           FILES ONLY' unless otherwise set by your system
                           administrator.  This option may not be available
                           on most versions of Lynx.
