  <h2>Overview</h2>

  <p><strong>Lynx</strong>'s <em>Visited Links Page</em> displays
  all of the links that you have traveled through during the
  current Lynx session, except for any temporary menu or list
  files, bookmark files, or any documents associated with POST
  content. The VLINKS keystroke command for invoking this page
  normally is mapped to uppercase '<em>V</em>'. The list of Visited
  Links is normally in order of recency (most recently visited
  links first), without repetitions in the list if a link was
  visited more than once during the session (unless the URLs differ
  due to appended fragments), and is supplementary to the <a href=
  "history_help.html">History Page</a>.</p>

  <h2>Navigation</h2>

  <p>You may <a href="movement_help.html">select</a> any link on
  the Visited Links Page to retrieve a document that you had
  previously visited, or you can use this list to save such links
  in your <a href="bookmark_help.html">bookmark files</a>, or to
  <a href="../Lynx_users_guide.html#RemoteSource">Download</a>
  them.</p>

  <p>In contrast to the History Page, the Visited Links Page
  includes any links which were retrieved for
  '<em>d</em>'ownloading or were passed to helper applications,
  i.e., not just the links that were rendered and displayed by
  Lynx, itself.</p>

  <h2>Configuration</h2>

  <p>You may change the appearance of the Visited Links Page via a
  popup menu on that page (which also appears on the <a href=
  "option_help.html#VP">Options Menu</a>). The menu allows you to
  choose whether to view the list ordered by the first or last
  visit, forward or reversed &ndash; or a mixture (a tree
  structure).</p>
