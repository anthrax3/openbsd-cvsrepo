@1 LYNX
2 Name
       lynx  - a general purpose distributed information browser for the World
       Wide Web

2 Synopsis
       lynx [options] [optional paths or URLs]

       lynx [options] [path or URL] -get_data
       data
       --

       lynx [options] [path or URL] -post_data
       data
       --

       Use "lynx -help" to display a complete list of current options.

2 Description
       Lynx is a fully-featured World Wide Web (WWW) client for users  running
       cursor-addressable,   character-cell   display   devices  (e.g.,  vt100
       terminals, vt100 emulators running on Windows 95/NT/XP/7/8 or any POSIX
       platform,  or  any  other  "curses-oriented" display).  It will display
       hypertext markup language (HTML) documents containing  links  to  files
       residing  on  the  local  system,  as  well as files residing on remote
       systems running Gopher, HTTP, FTP, WAIS,  and  NNTP  servers.   Current
       versions  of Lynx run on Unix, VMS, Windows 95/NT/XP/7/8, DOS DJGPP and
       OS/2.

       Lynx can be used to access information on the World  Wide  Web,  or  to
       build  information  systems  intended  primarily for local access.  For
       example, Lynx has been used to build several  Campus  Wide  Information
       Systems  (CWIS).   In  addition,  Lynx  can  be  used  to build systems
       isolated within a single LAN.

2 Options
       At start up, Lynx will load any local file or remote URL  specified  at
       the  command line.  For help with URLs, press "?"  or "H" while running
       Lynx.  Then follow the link titled, "Help on URLs."

       If more than one local file or remote URL  is  listed  on  the  command
       line,  Lynx  will  open  only the last interactively.  All of the names
       (local files and remote URLs) are added to the G)oto history.

       Lynx uses only long option names.  Option names can begin  with  double
       dash  as well, underscores and dashes can be intermixed in option names
       (in the reference below options are with one dash before them and  with
       underscores).

       Lynx  provides many command-line options.  Some options require a value
       (string, number or keyword).  These are noted in the  reference  below.
       The  other  options set boolean values in the program.  There are three
       types of boolean options: set, unset and toggle.  If no option value is
       given, these have the obvious meaning: set (to true), unset (to false),
       or toggle (between true/false).  For any of these,  an  explicit  value
       can  be  given  in  different  forms  to  allow  for  operating  system
       constraints, e.g.,
              -center:off
              -center=off
              -center-
       Lynx recognizes "1", "+", "on" and "true" for  true  values,  and  "0",
       "-",  "off"  and  "false"  for  false  values.  Other option-values are
       ignored.

       The default boolean, number and string option values that are  compiled
       into  Lynx  are  displayed  in the help-message provided by lynx -help.
       Some of those may differ according to how Lynx was built; see the  help
       message  itself for these values.  The -help option is processed in the
       third pass of options-processing, so any option which sets a value,  as
       well as runtime configuration values are reflected in the help-message.

       -      If  the  argument  is only `-', then Lynx expects to receive the
              arguments from the standard input.  This is  to  allow  for  the
              potentially  very  long command line that can be associated with
              the -get_data or -post_data arguments (see below).  It can  also
              be  used  to  avoid having sensitive information in the invoking
              command line (which would be visible to other processes on  most
              systems), especially when the -auth or -pauth options are used.

       -accept_all_cookies
              accept all cookies.

       -anonymous
              apply    restrictions    for   anonymous   account,   see   also
              -restrictions.

       -assume_charset=MIMEname
              charset for documents that don't specify it.

       -assume_local_charset=MIMEname
              charset assumed for local files, i.e., files which Lynx  creates
              such as internal pages for the options menu.

       -assume_unrec_charset=MIMEname
              use this instead of unrecognized charsets.

       -auth=ID:PASSWD
              set  authorization  ID  and  password for protected documents at
              startup.  Be sure to protect any script  files  which  use  this
              switch.

       -base  prepend  a request URL comment and BASE tag to text/html outputs
              for -source dumps.

       -bibhost=URL
              specify a local bibp server (default http://bibhost/).

       -blink forces high intensity  background  colors  for  color  mode,  if
              available  and  supported  by the terminal.  This applies to the
              slang library (for a few terminal emulators),  or  to  OS/2  EMX
              with ncurses.

       -book  use  the bookmark page as the startfile.  The default or command
              line startfile is still set for the  Main  screen  command,  and
              will be used if the bookmark page is unavailable or blank.

       -buried_news
              toggles  scanning  of  news  articles for buried references, and
              converts them to news  links.   Not  recommended  because  email
              addresses  enclosed in angle brackets will be converted to false
              news links, and uuencoded messages can be trashed.

       -cache=NUMBER
              set the NUMBER of documents cached in memory.   The  default  is
              10.

       -case  enable case-sensitive string searching.

       -center
              Toggle center alignment in HTML TABLE.

       -cfg=FILENAME
              specifies  a  Lynx  configuration  file  other  than the default
              lynx.cfg.

       -child exit on left-arrow in startfile, and disable save  to  disk  and
              associated print/mail options.

       -child_relaxed
              exit  on  left-arrow  in  startfile,  but allow save to disk and
              associated print/mail options.

       -cmd_log=FILENAME
              write  keystroke  commands  and  related  information   to   the
              specified file.

       -cmd_script=FILENAME
              read  keystroke  commands  from the specified file.  You can use
              the data written using the -cmd_log option.   Lynx  will  ignore
              other  information which the command-logging may have written to
              the logfile.  Each line of the command script contains either  a
              comment beginning with "#", or a keyword:

              exit
                 causes   the   script  to  stop,  and  forces  Lynx  to  exit
                 immediately.

              key
                 the character value, in printable  form.   Cursor  and  other
                 special   keys  are  given  as  names,  e.g.,  "Down  Arrow".
                 Printable 7-bit ASCII codes are given as-is, and  hexadecimal
                 values represent other 8-bit codes.

              set
                 followed  by a "name=value" allows one to override values set
                 in the lynx.cfg or .lynxrc files.  Lynx  tries  the  cfg-file
                 setting first.

       -color forces  color  mode  on,  if  available.   Default color control
              sequences which work for many terminal types are assumed if  the
              terminal  capability  description does not specify how to handle
              color.  Lynx needs to be compiled with  the  slang  library  for
              this flag, it is equivalent to setting the COLORTERM environment
              variable.  (If color support is instead  provided  by  a  color-
              capable  curses  library like ncurses, Lynx relies completely on
              the terminal description to  determine  whether  color  mode  is
              possible,  and this flag is not needed and thus unavailable.)  A
              saved show_color=always setting  found  in  a  .lynxrc  file  at
              startup  has the same effect.  A saved show_color=never found in
              .lynxrc on startup is overridden by this flag.

       -connect_timeout=N
              Sets the connection timeout, where N is given in seconds.

       -cookie_file=FILENAME
              specifies a file to use to read cookies.  If none is  specified,
              the  default  value  is  ~/.lynx_cookies  for  most systems, but
              ~/cookies for MS-DOS.

       -cookie_save_file=FILENAME
              specifies a file to use to store cookies.  If none is specified,
              the value given by -cookie_file is used.

       -cookies
              toggles handling of Set-Cookie headers.

       -core  toggles forced core dumps on fatal errors.  Turn this option off
              to ask Lynx to force a core dump if a fatal error occurs.

       -crawl with -traversal, output each page to a file.  with -dump, format
              output as with -traversal, but to the standard output.

       -curses_pads
              toggles   the   use  of  curses  "pad"  feature  which  supports
              left/right scrolling of the display.  The  feature  is  normally
              available  for curses configurations, but inactive.  To activate
              it, use  the  "|"  character  or  the  LINEWRAP_TOGGLE  command.
              Toggling this option makes the feature altogether unavailable.

       -debug_partial
              separate incremental display stages with MessageSecs delay

       -default-colors
              toggles  the default-colors feature which is normally set in the
              lynx.cfg file.

       -delay add DebugSecs delay after each progress-message

       -display=DISPLAY
              set the display variable for X rexec-ed programs.

       -display_charset=MIMEname
              set the charset for the terminal output.

       -dont_wrap_pre
              inhibit wrapping of text when  -dump'ing  and  -crawl'ing,  mark
              wrapped lines of <pre> in interactive session.

       -dump  dumps  the  formatted  output  of  the default document or those
              specified on  the  command  line  to  standard  output.   Unlike
              interactive mode, all documents are processed.  This can be used
              in the following way:

              lynx -dump http://www.subir.com/lynx.html

              Files specified on the command line are  formatted  as  HTML  if
              their  names  end  with one of the standard web suffixes such as
              ".htm" or ".html".  Use the -force_html option to  format  files
              whose names do not follow this convention.

       -editor=EDITOR
              enable  external  editing, using the specified EDITOR.  (vi, ed,
              emacs, etc.)

       -emacskeys
              enable emacs-like key movement.

       -enable_scrollback
              toggles compatibility with  communication  programs'  scrollback
              keys (may be incompatible with some curses packages).

       -error_file=FILE
              define a file where Lynx will report HTTP access codes.

       -exec  enable local program execution (normally not configured).

       -fileversions
              include all versions of files in local VMS directory listings.

       -find_leaks
              toggle memory leak-checking.  Normally this is not compiled-into
              your executable, but when it  is,  it  can  be  disabled  for  a
              session.

       -force_empty_hrefless_a
              force  HREF-less `A' elements to be empty (close them as soon as
              they are seen).

       -force_html
              forces the first document to be interpreted as HTML.

              This is most useful  when  processing  files  specified  on  the
              command line which have an unrecognized suffix (or the suffix is
              associated with a non-HTML type, such as ".txt" for  plain  text
              files).

              Lynx recognizes these file suffixes as HTML:
              ".ht3",  ".htm",  ".html3",  ".html", ".htmlx", ".php3", ".php",
              ".phtml", ".sht", and ".shtml".

              The -force_html option does not apply to non-interactive options
              such as -dump or -crawl.

       -force_secure
              toggles forcing of the secure flag for SSL cookies.

       -forms_options
              toggles whether the Options Menu is key-based or form-based.

       -from  toggles transmissions of From headers.

       -ftp   disable ftp access.

       -get_data
              properly  formatted  data  for  a  get form are read in from the
              standard input and passed to the form.  Input is terminated by a
              line that starts with `---'.

              Lynx  issues  an  HTTP  GET, sending the form to the path or URL
              given on the command-line and prints the response of the server.
              If  no  path  or URL is given, Lynx sends the form to the start-
              page.

       -head  send a HEAD request for the mime headers.

       -help  print the Lynx command syntax usage message, and exit.

       -hiddenlinks=[option]
              control the display of hidden links.

              merge
                 hidden links show up as bracketed numbers  and  are  numbered
                 together with other links in the sequence of their occurrence
                 in the document.

              listonly
                 hidden links are shown only on  L)ist  screens  and  listings
                 generated  by  -dump  or  from  the  P)rint  menu, but appear
                 separately at the end of those lists.  This  is  the  default
                 behavior.

              ignore
                 hidden links do not appear even in listings.

       -historical
              toggles use of `>' or `-->' as a terminator for comments.

       -homepage=URL
              set homepage separate from start page.

       -image_links
              toggles inclusion of links for all images.

       -index=URL
              set the default index file to the specified URL.

       -ismap toggles  inclusion  of  ISMAP  links  when  client-side MAPs are
              present.

       -justify
              do justification of text.

       -link=NUMBER
              starting count for lnk#.dat files produced by -crawl.

       -list_inline
              for -dump, show the links inline with the text.

       -listonly
              for -dump, show only the list of links.

       -localhost
              disable URLs that point to remote hosts.

       -locexec
              enable local program execution from local files  only  (if  Lynx
              was compiled with local execution enabled).

       -lss=FILENAME
              specify   filename   containing  color-style  information.   The
              default is lynx.lss.  If you give an empty filename, Lynx uses a
              built-in  monochrome  scheme  which imitates the non-color-style
              configuration.

              This flag is not available on all  systems,  Lynx  needs  to  be
              compiled  with  HAVE_SIGACTION defined.  If available, this flag
              may cause Lynx to react more immediately to window changes  when
              run within an xterm.

       -nonumbers
              disable    link-    and    field-numbering.     This   overrides
              -number_fields and -number_links.

              standard input and passed to the form.  Input is terminated by a
              line that starts with `---'.

              Lynx  issues  an  HTTP POST, sending the form to the path or URL
              given on the command-line and prints the response of the server.
              If  no  path  or URL is given, Lynx sends the form to the start-
              page.

       -preparsed

              Sets the read-timeout, where N is given in seconds.

       -reload
              flushes the cache on a proxy server  (only  the  first  document
              given on the command-line is affected).

       -restrictions=[option][,option][,option]...
              allows  a  list  of services to be disabled selectively.  Dashes
              and  underscores  in  option  names  can  be  intermixed.    The
              following list is printed if no options are specified.

                 telnet_port, jump, mail, print, exec, and goto.  The settings
                 for these,  as  well  as  additional  goto  restrictions  for
                 specific  URL schemes that are also applied, are derived from
                 definitions within userdefs.h.

                 from outside your domain  (utmp  required  for  selectivity).
                 This  restriction  applies to "news", "nntp", "newspost", and
                 "newsreply"  URLs,  but  not  to  "snews",  "snewspost",   or
                 "snewsreply" in case they are supported.

              outside_rlogin

              toggles  forced  resubmissions  (no-cache)  of forms with method
              POST when the  documents  they  returned  are  sought  with  the
              PREV_DOC command or from the History List.

       -rlogin
              disable recognition of rlogin commands.

       -scrollbar
              toggles showing scrollbar.

       -scrollbar_arrow
              toggles showing arrows at ends of the scrollbar.

       -selective
              require .www_browsable files to browse directories.

       -session=FILENAME
              resumes from specified file on startup and saves session to that
              file on exit.

       -sessionin=FILENAME
              resumes session from specified file.

       -sessionout=FILENAME
              saves session to specified file.

       -short_url
              show very long URLs in the status line with "..."  to  represent
              the portion which cannot be displayed.  The beginning and end of
              the URL are displayed, rather than suppressing the end.

       -show_cfg
              Print the configuration settings, e.g., as read from "lynx.cfg",
              and exit.

       -show_cursor
              If  enabled  the  cursor  will  not  be hidden in the right hand
              corner but will instead  be  positioned  at  the  start  of  the
              currently selected link.  Show cursor is the default for systems
              without FANCY_CURSES capabilities.   The  default  configuration
              can  be  changed  in  userdefs.h  or lynx.cfg.  The command line
              switch toggles the default.

       -show_rate
              If enabled the transfer  rate  is  shown  in  bytes/second.   If
              disabled,  no  transfer  rate  is  shown.   Use  lynx.cfg or the
              options menu to select KB/second and/or ETA.

       -soft_dquotes
              toggles emulation of the  old  Netscape  and  Mosaic  bug  which
              treated `>' as a co-terminator for double-quotes and tags.

       -source
              works  the  same  as  dump  but  outputs  HTML source instead of
              formatted text.  For example

              lynx -source . >foo.html

              generates  HTML  source  listing  the  files  in   the   current
              directory.   Each  file  is  marked  by  an HREF relative to the
              parent directory.  Add a  trailing  slash  to  make  the  HREF's
              relative to the current directory:

              lynx -source ./ >foo.html

       -stack_dump
              disable SIGINT cleanup handler

       -startfile_ok
              allow non-http startfile and homepage with -validate.

       -stderr
              When  dumping  a  document using -dump or -source, Lynx normally
              does not display alert (error) messages  that  you  see  on  the
              screen  in the status line.  Use the -stderr option to tell Lynx
              to write these messages to the standard error.

       -stdin read the startfile from standard input (UNIX only).

       -syslog=text
              information for syslog call.

       -syslog-urls
              log requested URLs with syslog.

       -tagsoup
              initialize parser, using Tag Soup DTD rather than SortaSGML.

       -telnet
              disable recognition of telnet commands.

       -term=TERM
              tell Lynx what terminal type to assume it is talking to.   (This
              may  be  useful  for  remote  execution, when, for example, Lynx
              connects to a remote TCP/IP port that starts a script  that,  in
              turn, starts another Lynx process.)

       -timeout=N
              For  win32,  sets  the network read-timeout, where N is given in
              seconds.

       -tlog  toggles between using a Lynx Trace  Log  and  stderr  for  trace
              output from the session.

       -tna   turns on "Textfields Need Activation" mode.

       -trace turns  on  Lynx trace mode.  Destination of trace output depends
              on -tlog.

       -trace_mask=value
              turn on optional traces, which may result in  very  large  trace
              files.  Logically OR the values to combine options:

              1  SGML character parsing states

              2  color-style

              4  TRST (table layout)

              8  configuration  (lynx.cfg,  .lynxrc, .lynx-keymaps, mime.types
                 and mailcap contents)

              16 binary string copy/append, used in form data construction.

              32 cookies

              64 character sets

              128
                 GridText parsing

              256
                 timing

       -traversal
              traverse all http links derived from startfile.  When used  with
              -crawl,  each link that begins with the same string as startfile
              is output to a file, intended for indexing.  See  CRAWL.announce
              for more information.

       -trim_input_fields
              trim input text/textarea fields in forms.

       -underline_links
              toggles use of underline/bold attribute for links.

       -underscore
              toggles use of _underline_ format in dumps.

       -unique_urls
              check  for duplicate link numbers in each page and corresponding
              lists, and reuse the original link number.

       -use_mouse
              turn on mouse support, if available.  Clicking  the  left  mouse
              button  on a link traverses it.  Clicking the right mouse button
              pops back.  Click on the top line to scroll up.   Click  on  the
              bottom  line to scroll down.  The first few positions in the top
              and bottom line may invoke additional functions.  Lynx  must  be
              compiled  with  ncurses  or  slang  to support this feature.  If
              ncurses is used, clicking the middle  mouse  button  pops  up  a
              simple  menu.  Mouse clicks may only work reliably while Lynx is
              idle waiting for input.

       -useragent=Name
              set alternate Lynx User-Agent header.

       -validate
              accept only  http  URLs  (for  validation).   Complete  security
              restrictions also are implemented.

       -verbose
              toggle  [LINK],  [IMAGE] and [INLINE] comments with filenames of
              these images.

       -version
              print version information, and exit.

       -vikeys
              enable vi-like key movement.

       -wdebug
              enable Waterloo tcp/ip packet debug (print to  watt  debugfile).
              This  applies  only  to  DOS  versions  compiled  with WATTCP or
              WATT-32.

       -width=NUMBER
              number of columns for formatting of dumps, default is 80.   This
              is  limited  by  the  number of columns that Lynx could display,
              typically 1024 (the MAX_LINE symbol).

       -with_backspaces
              emit backspaces in output if -dump'ing or -crawl'ing (like `man'
              does)

       -xhtml_parsing
              tells Lynx that it can ignore certain tags which have no content
              in an XHTML 1.0 document.  For example "<p/>" will be discarded.

2 Commands
       o  Use Up arrow and Down arrow to scroll through hypertext links.

       o  Right arrow or Return will follow a highlighted hypertext link.

       o  Left Arrow will retreat from a link.

       o  Type "H" or "?" for  online  help  and  descriptions  of  key-stroke
          commands.

       o  Type  "K"  for  a  complete  list  of the current key-stroke command
          mappings.

2 Environment
       In addition to various "standard" environment variables such  as  HOME,
       PATH,  USER,  DISPLAY, TMPDIR, etc, Lynx utilizes several Lynx-specific
       environment variables, if they exist.

       Others may be created or modified by Lynx to pass data to  an  external
       program, or for other reasons.  These are listed separately below.

       See  also  the  sections  on  SIMULATED CGI SUPPORT and NATIVE LANGUAGE
       SUPPORT, below.

       Note:  Not all environment variables apply to all  types  of  platforms
       supported  by  Lynx, though most do.  Feedback on platform dependencies
       is solicited.

       Environment Variables Used By Lynx:

       COLORTERM           If set, color capability for the terminal is forced
                           on  at  startup time.  The actual value assigned to
                           the variable is ignored.   This  variable  is  only
                           meaningful  if  Lynx  was  built  using  the  slang
                           screen-handling library.

       LYNX_CFG            This variable, if set, will  override  the  default
                           location  and name of the global configuration file
                           (normally,  lynx.cfg)  that  was  defined  by   the
                           LYNX_CFG_FILE  constant  in  the  userdefs.h  file,
                           during installation.  See the userdefs.h  file  for
                           more information.

       LYNX_CFG_PATH       If  set,  this  variable  overrides the compiled-in
                           search-list  of  directories  used  to   find   the
                           configuration  files,  e.g., lynx.cfg and lynx.lss.
                           The list is delimited with ":" (or ";" for Windows)
                           like the PATH environment variable.

       LYNX_HELPFILE       If set, this variable overrides the compiled-in URL
                           and configuration file URL for the Lynx help file.

       LYNX_LOCALEDIR      If set, this  variable  overrides  the  compiled-in
                           location  of  the  locale  directory which contains
                           native language (NLS) message text.

       LYNX_LSS            This variable, if set, specifies  the  location  of
                           the   default  Lynx  character  style  sheet  file.
                           [Currently only meaningful if Lynx was built  using
                           curses color style support.]

       LYNX_SAVE_SPACE     This  variable,  if  set, will override the default
                           path prefix for files saved to disk that is defined
                           in  the  lynx.cfg  SAVE_SPACE:  statement.  See the
                           lynx.cfg file for more information.

       LYNX_TEMP_SPACE     This variable, if set, will  override  the  default
                           path  prefix  for  temporary files that was defined
                           during installation, as well as any value that  may
                           be assigned to the TMPDIR variable.

       MAIL                This variable specifies the default inbox Lynx will
                           check for new mail, if such checking is enabled  in
                           the lynx.cfg file.

       NEWS_ORGANIZATION   This  variable, if set, provides the string used in
                           the Organization: header of USENET  news  postings.
                           It  will  override  the setting of the ORGANIZATION
                           environment variable, if it is also  set  (and,  on
                           UNIX, the contents of an /etc/organization file, if
                           present).

       NNTPSERVER          If set, this variable specifies  the  default  NNTP
                           server  that  will  be used for USENET news reading
                           and posting with Lynx, via news: URL's.

       ORGANIZATION        This variable, if set, provides the string used  in
                           the  Organization:  header of USENET news postings.
                           On UNIX,  it  will  override  the  contents  of  an
                           /etc/organization file, if present.

       PROTOCOL_proxy      Lynx supports the use of proxy servers that can act
                           as firewall gateways and caching servers.  They are
                           preferable   to  the  older  gateway  servers  (see
                           WWW_access_GATEWAY, below).  Each protocol used  by
                           Lynx,  (http,  ftp,  gopher,  etc),  can  be mapped
                           separately by setting environment variables of  the
                           form    PROTOCOL_proxy    (literally:   http_proxy,
                           ftp_proxy,       gopher_proxy,       etc),       to
                           "http://some.server.dom:port/".    See  Lynx  Users
                           Guide for additional details and examples.

       SSL_CERT_DIR        Set   to   the   directory    containing    trusted
                           certificates.

       SSL_CERT_FILE       Set  to the full path and filename for your file of
                           trusted certificates.

       WWW_access_GATEWAY  Lynx still supports use of  gateway  servers,  with
                           the   servers  specified  via  "WWW_access_GATEWAY"
                           variables (where "access" is lower case and can  be
                           "http",  "ftp",  "gopher"  or "wais"), however most
                           gateway servers have been discontinued.  Note  that
                           you do not include a terminal `/' for gateways, but
                           do  for   proxies   specified   by   PROTOCOL_proxy
                           environment  variables.   See  Lynx Users Guide for
                           details.

       WWW_HOME            This variable, if set, will  override  the  default
                           startup   URL   specified   in   any  of  the  Lynx
                           configuration files.

       Environment Variables Set or Modified By Lynx:

       LYNX_PRINT_DATE     This variable is set by the Lynx p(rint)  function,
                           to   the   Date:  string  seen  in  the  document's
                           "Information about" page (= cmd), if  any.   It  is
                           created  for use by an external program, as defined
                           in a lynx.cfg PRINTER:  definition  statement.   If
                           the  field  does  not  exist  for the document, the
                           variable is set to a null string under UNIX, or "No
                           Date" under VMS.

       LYNX_PRINT_LASTMOD  This  variable is set by the Lynx p(rint) function,
                           to the Last Mod:  string  seen  in  the  document's
                           "Information  about"  page  (= cmd), if any.  It is
                           created for use by an external program, as  defined
                           in  a  lynx.cfg  PRINTER: definition statement.  If
                           the field does not  exist  for  the  document,  the
                           variable is set to a null string under UNIX, or "No
                           LastMod" under VMS.

       LYNX_PRINT_TITLE    This variable is set by the Lynx p(rint)  function,
                           to  the  Linkname:  string  seen  in the document's
                           "Information about" page (= cmd), if  any.   It  is
                           created  for use by an external program, as defined
                           in a lynx.cfg PRINTER:  definition  statement.   If
                           the  field  does  not  exist  for the document, the
                           variable is set to a null string under UNIX, or "No
                           Title" under VMS.

       LYNX_PRINT_URL      This  variable is set by the Lynx p(rint) function,
                           to  the  URL:  string  seen   in   the   document's
                           "Information  about"  page  (= cmd), if any.  It is
                           created for use by an external program, as  defined
                           in  a  lynx.cfg  PRINTER: definition statement.  If
                           the field does not  exist  for  the  document,  the
                           variable is set to a null string under UNIX, or "No
                           URL" under VMS.

       LYNX_TRACE          If set, causes Lynx to write a trace file as if the
                           -trace option were supplied.

       LYNX_TRACE_FILE     If set, overrides the compiled-in name of the trace
                           file, which is either  Lynx.trace  or  LY-TRACE.LOG
                           (the  latter  on  the  DOS/Windows platforms).  The
                           trace file is in either case relative to  the  home
                           directory.

       LYNX_VERSION        This  variable  is  always  set by Lynx, and may be
                           used by an external program to determine if it  was
                           invoked  by  Lynx.   See  also  the comments in the
                           distribution's sample mailcap file,  for  notes  on
                           usage in such a file.

       TERM                Normally,   this   variable  is  used  by  Lynx  to
                           determine the terminal type being  used  to  invoke
                           Lynx.  If, however, it is unset at startup time (or
                           has the value "unknown"), or if the -term  command-
                           line  option  is  used (see OPTIONS section above),
                           Lynx will set or  modify  its  value  to  the  user
                           specified  terminal  type  (for  the Lynx execution
                           environment).  Note: If set/modified by  Lynx,  the
                           values  of  the  LINES  and/or  COLUMNS environment
                           variables may also be changed.

2 Simulated Cgi Support
       If built with the cgi-links option enabled, Lynx allows access to a cgi
       script directly without the need for an http daemon.

       When  executing  such  "lynxcgi  scripts"  (if  enabled), the following
       variables may be set for simulating a CGI environment:

       CONTENT_LENGTH

       CONTENT_TYPE

       DOCUMENT_ROOT

       HTTP_ACCEPT_CHARSET

       HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE

       HTTP_USER_AGENT

       PATH_INFO

       PATH_TRANSLATED

       QUERY_STRING

       REMOTE_ADDR

       REMOTE_HOST

       REQUEST_METHOD

       SERVER_SOFTWARE

       Other environment variables are not inherited  by  the  script,  unless
       they   are   provided   via  a  LYNXCGI_ENVIRONMENT  statement  in  the
       configuration file.  See the lynx.cfg file, and  the  (draft)  CGI  1.1
       Specification <http://Web.Golux.Com/coar/cgi/draft-coar-cgi-v11-00.txt>
       for the definition and usage of these variables.

       The CGI Specification, and other associated  documentation,  should  be
       consulted for general information on CGI script programming.

2 Native Language Support
       If  configured  and  installed  with Native Language Support, Lynx will
       display status and other messages in your local language.  See the file
       ABOUT_NLS  in  the  source distribution, or at your local GNU site, for
       more information about internationalization.

       The following environment  variables  may  be  used  to  alter  default
       settings:

       LANG                This  variable,  if  set, will override the default
                           message language.  It is an ISO 639 two-letter code
                           identifying  the  language.  Language codes are NOT
                           the same as the country codes given in ISO 3166.

       LANGUAGE            This variable, if set, will  override  the  default
                           message language.  This is a GNU extension that has
                           higher priority for  setting  the  message  catalog
                           than LANG or LC_ALL.

       LC_ALL              and

       LC_MESSAGES         These  variables,  if  set,  specify  the notion of
                           native language formatting style.  They are POSIXly
                           correct.

       LINGUAS             This  variable,  if  set  prior  to  configuration,
                           limits the installed languages to specific  values.
                           It  is  a space-separated list of two-letter codes.
                           Currently, it is hard-coded to a wish list.

       NLSPATH             This variable, if set, is used as the  path  prefix
                           for message catalogs.

       Note that man page availability and section numbering is somewhat platform
       dependent, and may vary from the above references.

       A  section  shown as (GNU), is intended to denote that the topic may be
       available via an info page, instead of a man page (i.e., try "info subject",
       rather than "man subject").

       A  section shown as (?) denotes that documentation on the topic exists,
       but is not part of an established documentation retrieval  system  (see
       the  distribution files associated with the topic, or contact your System
       Administrator for further information).

2 Acknowledgments
       Lynx has incorporated code from a variety of  sources  along  the  way.
       The  earliest versions of Lynx included code from Earl Fogel of Comput-
       ing Services at the University of Saskatchewan, who implemented  HYPER-
       REZ  in the Unix environment.  HYPERREZ was developed by Niel Larson of
       Think.com and served as the model  for  the  early  versions  of  Lynx.
       Those versions also incorporated libraries from the Unix Gopher clients
       developed at the University of Minnesota, and  the  later  versions  of
       Lynx  rely  on the WWW client library code developed by Tim Berners-Lee
       and the WWW community.  Also a special thanks to  Foteos  Macrides  who
       ported much of Lynx to VMS and did or organized most of its development
       since the departures of Lou Montulli and Garrett Blythe from  the  Uni-
       versity  of Kansas in the summer of 1994 through the release of v2.7.2,
       and to everyone on the net who has contributed  to  Lynx's  development
       either directly (through patches, comments or bug reports) or indirect-
       ly (through inspiration and development of other systems).

       Lynx provides many command-line options.  Some options require a  value
       (string,  number  or keyword).  These are noted in the reference below.
       The other options set boolean values in the program.  There  are  three

       message itself for these values.  The -help option is processed in  the

       Lynx  has  incorporated  code  from a variety of sources along the way.
       The earliest versions of Lynx included code from Earl Fogel of  Comput-
       ing  Services at the University of Saskatchewan, who implemented HYPER-
       REZ in the Unix environment.  HYPERREZ was developed by Niel Larson  of
       Think.com  and  served  as  the  model  for the early versions of Lynx.

       options.

       Lynx  is  a fully-featured World Wide Web (WWW) client for
       users running cursor-addressable,  character-cell  display
       devices (e.g., vt100 terminals, vt100 emulators running on
       Windows  95/NT  or  Macintoshes,  or  any  other  "curses-
       oriented"  display).   It  will  display  hypertext markup
       language  (HTML)  documents  containing  links  to   files
       residing on the local system, as well as files residing on
       remote systems running Gopher, HTTP, FTP, WAIS,  and  NNTP
       servers.   Current  versions  of  Lynx  run  on Unix, VMS,
       Windows 95/NT, 386DOS and OS/2 EMX.

       Lynx can be used to access information on the  World  Wide
       Web,  or  to  build information systems intended primarily
       for local access.  For example,  Lynx  has  been  used  to
       build  several Campus Wide Information Systems (CWIS).  In
       addition, Lynx can  be  used  to  build  systems  isolated
       within a single LAN.
d28 43
a70 19
       At  start  up, Lynx will load any local file or remote URL
       specified at the command line.  For help with URLs,  press
       "?"   or  "H"  while  running  Lynx.  Then follow the link
       titled, "Help on URLs."

       Lynx uses only long option names. Option names  can  begin
       with  double  dash  as well, underscores and dashes can be
       intermixed in option names (in the reference below options
       are with one dash before them and with underscores).

       -      If  the  argument is only `-', then Lynx expects to
              receive the arguments from stdin.  This is to allow
              for the potentially very long command line that can
              be associated  with  the  -get_data  or  -post_data
              arguments  (see  below).   It  can  also be used to
              avoid having sensitive information in the  invoking
              command  line  (which  would  be  visible  to other
              processes on most  systems),  especially  when  the
              -auth or -pauth options are used.

       -blink forces high intensity background colors  for  color
              mode,  if  available and supported by the terminal.
              This applies  to  the  slang  library  (for  a  few
              terminal emulators), or to OS/2 EMX with ncurses.

       -book  use  the  bookmark  page  as  the  startfile.   The
              default or command line startfile is still set  for
              the  Main  screen  command, and will be used if the
              bookmark page is unavailable or blank.

              read keystroke commands from  the  specified  file.
              You  can  use  the  data written using the -cmd_log
              option.  Lynx will ignore other  information  which
              the   command-logging   may  have  written  to  the
              logfile.  Each line of the command script  contains
              either a comment beginning with "#", or a keyword:

            exit causes  the  script  to stop, and forces lynx to
                 exit immediately.

            key  the character value, in printable form.   Cursor
                 and other special keys are given as names, e.g.,
                 "Down Arrow".  Printable 7-bit ASCII  codes  are
                 given  as-is,  and  hexadecimal values represent
                 other 8-bit codes.

            set  followed  by  a  "name=value"  allows   one   to
                 override values set in the lynx.cfg file.

       -color forces  color mode on, if available.  Default color
              control sequences  which  work  for  many  terminal
              types   are  assumed  if  the  terminal  capability
              description does not specify how to  handle  color.
              Lynx  needs  to  be compiled with the slang library
              for this flag, it  is  equivalent  to  setting  the
              COLORTERM  environment variable.  (If color support
              is  instead  provided  by  a  color-capable  curses
              library like ncurses, Lynx relies completely on the
              terminal description  to  determine  whether  color
              mode  is  possible, and this flag is not needed and
              thus  unavailable.)   A   saved   show_color=always
              setting  found in a .lynxrc file at startup has the
              same effect.  A  saved  show_color=never  found  in

              turn  on mouse support, if available.  Clicking the
              left mouse button on a link traverses it.  Clicking

       In  addition  to  various "standard" environment variables
       such as HOME,  PATH,  USER,  DISPLAY,  TMPDIR,  etc,  Lynx
       utilizes  several  Lynx-specific environment variables, if
       they exist.

       Others may be created or modified by Lynx to pass data  to
       an  external  program,  or  for  other reasons.  These are
       listed separately below.

       See also the sections on SIMULATED CGI SUPPORT and  NATIVE
       LANGUAGE SUPPORT, below.

       Note:  Not all environment variables apply to all types of
       platforms supported by Lynx, though most do.  Feedback  on
       platform dependencies is solicited.

       COLORTERM           If   set,  color  capability  for  the
                           terminal is forced on at startup time.
                           The   actual  value  assigned  to  the
                           variable is ignored.  This variable is
                           only  meaningful  if  Lynx  was  built
                           using   the   slang    screen-handling
                           library.

       LYNX_CFG            This  variable,  if set, will override
                           the default location and name  of  the
                           global  configuration  file (normally,
                           lynx.cfg)  that  was  defined  by  the
                           LYNX_CFG_FILE    constant    in    the
                           userdefs.h file, during  installation.

                           information.

       LYNX_LOCALEDIR      If set, this  variable  overrides  the
                           compiled-in  location  of  the  locale
                           directory   which   contains    native
                           language (NLS) message text.

       LYNX_LSS            This  variable,  if set, specifies the
                           location of the default Lynx character

       LYNX_SAVE_SPACE     This  variable,  if set, will override
                           the  default  path  prefix  for  files
                           saved  to  disk that is defined in the
                           lynx.cfg SAVE_SPACE:  statement.   See
                           the    lynx.cfg    file    for   more
                           information.

       LYNX_TEMP_SPACE     This variable, if set,  will  override
                           the  default path prefix for temporary
                           files   that   was   defined    during
                           installation,  as  well  as  any value
                           that may be  assigned  to  the  TMPDIR
                           variable.

       MAIL                This  variable  specifies  the default
                           inbox Lynx will check for new mail, if
                           such   checking   is  enabled  in  the
                           lynx.cfg file.

       NEWS_ORGANIZATION   This variable, if  set,  provides  the
                           string   used   in  the  Organization:
                           header of USENET  news  postings.   It
                           will   override  the  setting  of  the
                           ORGANIZATION environment variable,  if
                           it  is  also  set  (and,  on UNIX, the
                           contents of an /etc/organization file,
                           if present).

       NNTPSERVER          If  set,  this  variable specifies the
                           default NNTP server that will be  used
                           for  USENET  news  reading and posting
                           with Lynx, via news: URL's.

       ORGANIZATION        This variable, if  set,  provides  the
                           string   used   in  the  Organization:
                           header of USENET  news  postings.   On
                           UNIX, it will override the contents of
                           an /etc/organization file, if present.

       PROTOCOL_proxy      Lynx supports the use of proxy servers
                           that can act as firewall gateways  and
                           caching  servers.  They are preferable
                           to  the  older  gateway  servers  (see
                           WWW_access_GATEWAY,    below).    Each
                           protocol used  by  Lynx,  (http,  ftp,
                           gopher, etc), can be mapped separately
                           by setting  environment  variables  of
                           the  form  PROTOCOL_proxy  (literally:
                           http_proxy,  ftp_proxy,  gopher_proxy,
                           etc),               to
                           "http://some.server.dom:port/".    See
                           Lynx   Users   Guide   for  additional

       WWW_access_GATEWAY  Lynx still  supports  use  of  gateway
                           servers,  with  the  servers specified
                           via   "WWW_access_GATEWAY"   variables
                           (where  "access" is lower case and can
                           be "http", "ftp", "gopher" or "wais"),
                           however most gateway servers have been
                           discontinued.  Note that  you  do  not
                           include  a  terminal `/' for gateways,
                           but  do  for  proxies   specified   by
                           PROTOCOL_proxy  environment variables.

       WWW_HOME            This variable, if set,  will  override
                           the  default  startup URL specified in
                           any of the Lynx configuration files.

       LYNX_PRINT_DATE     This  variable  is  set  by  the  Lynx
                           p(rint)  function, to the Date: string
                           seen in  the  document's  "Information
                           about"  page  (=  cmd), if any.  It is
                           created  for  use   by   an   external
                           program,  as  defined  in  a  lynx.cfg
                           PRINTER: definition statement.  If the
                           field does not exist for the document,
                           the variable is set to a  null  string
                           under UNIX, or "No Date" under VMS.

       LYNX_PRINT_LASTMOD  This  variable  is  set  by  the  Lynx
                           p(rint) function,  to  the  Last  Mod:
                           string    seen   in   the   document's
                           "Information about" page (=  cmd),  if
                           any.   It  is  created  for  use by an
                           external  program,  as  defined  in  a
                           lynx.cfg      PRINTER:      definition
                           statement.   If  the  field  does  not
                           exist  for  the document, the variable
                           is set to a null string under UNIX, or
                           "No LastMod" under VMS.

       LYNX_PRINT_TITLE    This  variable  is  set  by  the  Lynx
                           p(rint)  function,  to  the  Linkname:
                           string    seen   in   the   document's
                           "Information about" page (=  cmd),  if
                           any.   It  is  created  for  use by an
                           external  program,  as  defined  in  a
                           lynx.cfg      PRINTER:      definition
                           statement.   If  the  field  does  not
                           exist  for  the document, the variable
                           is set to a null string under UNIX, or
                           "No Title" under VMS.

       LYNX_PRINT_URL      This  variable  is  set  by  the  Lynx
                           p(rint) function, to the  URL:  string
                           seen  in  the  document's "Information
                           about" page (= cmd), if  any.   It  is
                           created   for   use   by  an  external
                           program,  as  defined  in  a  lynx.cfg
                           PRINTER: definition statement.  If the
                           field does not exist for the document,
                           the  variable  is set to a null string
                           under UNIX, or "No URL" under VMS.

       LYNX_TRACE          If set, causes Lynx to write  a  trace
                           file  as  if  the  -trace  option were
                           supplied.

       LYNX_TRACE_FILE     If set, overrides the compiled-in name
                           of  the  trace  file,  which is either
                           Lynx.trace or LY-TRACE.LOG (the latter
                           on  the DOS platform).  The trace file
                           is in either case relative to the home
                           directory.

       LYNX_VERSION        This  variable  is always set by Lynx,
                           and may be used by an external program
                           to  determine  if  it  was  invoked by
                           Lynx.  See also the  comments  in  the
                           distribution's  sample  mailcap  file,
                           for notes on usage in such a file.

       TERM                Normally, this  variable  is  used  by
                           Lynx  to  determine  the terminal type
                           being  used  to  invoke   Lynx.    If,
                           however,  it  is unset at startup time
                           (or has the value  "unknown"),  or  if
                           the  -term command-line option is used
                           (see OPTIONS section above), Lynx will
                           set  or  modify  its value to the user
                           specified terminal type (for the  Lynx
                           execution   environment).    Note:  If
                           set/modified by Lynx,  the  values  of

       If built with the cgi-links option  enabled,  Lynx  allows
       access  to  a  cgi script directly without the need for an
       http daemon.

       When executing such "lynxcgi scripts"  (if  enabled),  the
       following  variables  may  be  set  for  simulating  a CGI
       environment:

       If  configured and installed with Native Language Support,
       Lynx will display status and other messages in your  local
       language.    See   the   file   ABOUT_NLS  in  the  source
       distribution,  or  at  your  local  GNU  site,  for   more
       information about internationalization.

       The  following  environment variables may be used to alter
       default settings:

       LANG                This variable, if set,  will  override
                           the  default  message language.  It is
                           an ISO 639 two-letter code identifying
                           the  language.  Language codes are NOT
                           the same as the country codes given in
                           ISO 3166.

       LANGUAGE            This  variable,  if set, will override
                           the default message language.  This is
                           a   GNU   extension  that  has  higher
                           priority  for  setting   the   message
                           catalog than LANG or LC_ALL.
d937 8
a944 10
       LC_MESSAGES         These  variables,  if set, specify the
                           notion of native  language  formatting
                           style.  They are POSIXly correct.

       LINGUAS             This   variable,   if   set  prior  to
                           configuration,  limits  the  installed
                           languages to specific values.  It is a
                           space-separated  list  of   two-letter
                           codes.  Currently, it is hard-coded to
                           a wish list.

       NLSPATH             This variable, if set, is used as  the

       Lynx has incorporated code from a variety of sources along
       the way.  The earliest versions of Lynx included code from
       Earl  Fogel  of  Computing  Services  at the University of
       Saskatchewan, who implemented HYPERREZ in the  Unix  envi-
       ronment.    HYPERREZ  was  developed  by  Niel  Larson  of
       Think.com and served as the model for the  early  versions
       of  Lynx.  Those versions also incorporated libraries from
       the Unix Gopher clients developed  at  the  University  of
       Minnesota,  and the later versions of Lynx rely on the WWW
       client library code developed by Tim Berners-Lee  and  the
       WWW  community.   Also a special thanks to Foteos Macrides
       who ported much of Lynx to VMS and did or  organized  most
       of  its  development  since the departures of Lou Montulli
       and Garrett Blythe from the University of  Kansas  in  the
       summer  of  1994 through the release of v2.7.2, and to ev-
       eryone on the net who has contributed to  Lynx's  develop-
       ment either directly (through patches, comments or bug re-
       ports) or indirectly (through inspiration and  development
       of other systems).

 Wide Web
d6 2

     use "lynx -help" to display a complete list of current options.

2 DESCRIPTION
 Lynx is a fully-featured World Wide Web (WWW) client for users running
 cursor-addressable, character-cell display devices (e.g., vt100 terminals,
 vt100 emulators running on PCs or Macs, or any other "curses-oriented"
 display). It will display hypertext markup language (HTML) documents con-
 taining links to files residing on the local system, as well as files
 residing on remote systems running Gopher, HTTP, FTP, WAIS, and NNTP
 servers.  Current versions of Lynx run on Unix, VMS, Windows95/NT,
 386DOS and OS/2 EMX.
d24 6
a29 4
 Lynx can be used to access information on the World Wide Web, or to build
 information systems intended primarily for local access.  For example, Lynx
 has been used to build several Campus Wide Information Systems (CWIS).  In
 addition, Lynx can be used to build systems isolated within a single LAN.
d31 5
a35 4
2 OPTIONS
 At start up, Lynx will load any local file or remote URL specified at
 the command line.  For help with URLs, press "?" or "h" while running
 Lynx.  Then follow the link titled, "Help on URLs."
d37 4
a40 6
  -
       If the argument is only '-', then Lynx expects to receive
       arguments from stdin.  This is to allow for the potentially
       very long command line that can be associated with the
       -get_data or -post_data arguments (see below).  Encase it
       in double-quotes ("-").
d42 9
a50 2
  -accept_all_cookies
       accept all cookies.
d52 2
a53 2
  -anonymous
       used to specify the anonymous account.
d55 3
a57 2
  -assume_charset=MIMEname
       charset for documents that don't specify it.
d59 2
a60 2
  -assume_local_charset=MIMEname
       charset assumed for local files.
d62 2
a63 2
  -assume_unrec_charset=MIMEname
       use this instead of unrecognized charsets.
d65 2
a66 4
  -auth=ID:PASSWD
       set authorization ID and password for protected documents
       at startup.  Be sure to protect any script files which use
       this switch.
d68 4
a71 3
  -base
       prepend a request URL comment and BASE tag to text/html
       outputs for -source dumps.
d73 2
a74 4
  -blink
       forces high intensity bg colors for color mode, if available
       and supported by the terminal.
       Lynx needs to be compiled with the slang library for this flag.
d76 3
a78 4
  -book
       use the bookmark page as the startfile.  The default or command
       line startfile is still set for the Main screen command, and will
       be used if the bookmark page is unavailable or blank.

2 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
 Lynx has incorporated code from a variety of sources along the way.
 The earliest versions of Lynx included code from Earl Fogel of Computing
 Services at the University of Saskatchewan, who implemented HYPERREZ
 in the Unix environment.  HYPERREZ was developed by Niel Larson of
 Think.com and served as the model for the early versions of Lynx.
 Those versions also incorporated libraries from the Unix Gopher clients
 developed at the University of Minnesota, and the later versions of
 Lynx rely on the WWW client library code developed by Tim Berners-Lee
 and the WWW community.  Also a special thanks to Foteos Macrides who
 ported much of Lynx to VMS and did or organized most of its development
 since the departures of Lou Montulli and Garrett Blythe from the
 University of Kansas in the summer of 1994 through the release
 of v2.7.2, and to everyone on the net who has contributed to Lynx's
 development either directly (through patches, comments or bug reports)
 or indirectly (through inspiration and development of other systems).
