 * slash can be omitted.
 * Use lynxexec for commands or scripts that generate a screen output which
 * should be held via a prompt to press <return> before returning to Lynx
 * for display of the current document.
 * Use lynxprog for programs such as mail which do not require a pause before
 * Lynx restores the display of the current document.
 *
 * Execution scripts take the form of a standard
 * URL.  Extension mapping or MIME typing is used
 * to decide if the file is a script and should be
 * executed.  The current extensions are:
 * .csh, .ksh, and .sh on UNIX systems and .com on
 * VMS systems.  Any time a file of this type is
 * accessed Lynx will look at the user's options
 * settings to decide if the script can be executed.
 * Current options include: Only exec files that
 * reside on the local machine and are referenced
 * with a "file://localhost" URL, All execution
 * off, and all execution on.
 *
 * The following definitions will add execution
 * capabilities to Lynx.  You may define none, one
 * or both.
 *
 * I strongly recommend that you define neither one
 * of these since execution links/scripts can represent
 * very serious security risk to your system and its
 * users.  If you do define these I suggest that
 * you only allow users to execute files/scripts
 * that reside on your local machine.
 *
 * YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!
 *

 * also see src/HTInit.c to verify/change the execution

 * addressing, you should be able to fire up your main page with lynxcgi:path
 * and everything should work as if you were talking to the http daemon.
 *
 * Note that TRUSTED_LYNXCGI directives must be defined in your lynx.cfg file

 * CGI script support.  Defining LYNXCGI_LINKS allows you to use the

 *   lynxcgi:path
 *
 * URL which allows lynx to access a cgi script directly without the need for
 * a http daemon.  Redirection or mime support is not supported but just about
 * everything else is.  If the path is not an executable file then the URL is
 * rewritten as file://localhost and passed to the file loader.  This means
 * that if your http:html files are currently set up to use relative
 * addressing, you should be able to fire up your main page with lynxcgi:path
 * and everything should work as if you were talking to the http daemon.
 *
 * Note that TRUSTED_LYNXCGI directives must be defined in your lynx.cfg file
 * if you wish to place restrictions on source documents and/or paths for
 * lynxcgi links.
 *
 * The cgi scripts are called with a fork()/execve() sequence so you don't
 * have to worry about people trying to abuse the code. :-)
