Naming conventions

  Record                 is an entire line in file.
                         
  Field                  is an entity separated by colons and/or by end-of-line.
                         
  List                   is a field in which there are items separated by commas.
                         
Record-oriented Read Routines

   Password, group and ACL are internally read in by the following functions:
   
  HTAAFile_nextRec()      skips to the beginning of the next record (must be called even
                         after the last field of a record is read to proceed to the next
                         record).
                         
  HTAAFile_readField()    reads a field (separated by colons).
                         
  HTAAFile_readList()     reads a field containing a comma-separated list of items.
