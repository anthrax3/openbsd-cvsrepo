@/*                          SERVER SIDE ACCESS AUTHORIZATION MODULE
                                             
   This module is the server side interface to Access Authorization (AA) package. It
   contains code only for server.
   
   Important to know about memory allocation:
   
   Routines in this module use dynamic allocation, but free automatically all the memory
   reserved by them.
   
   Therefore the caller never has to (and never should) free() any object returned by
   these functions.
   
   Therefore also all the strings returned by this package are only valid until the next
   call to the same function is made. This approach is selected, because of the nature of
   access authorization: no string returned by the package needs to be valid longer than
   until the next call.
   
   This also makes it easy to plug the AA package in: you don't have to ponder whether to
   free()something here or is it done somewhere else (because it is always done somewhere
   else).
   
   The strings that the package needs to store are copied so the original strings given as
   parameters to AA functions may be freed or modified with no side effects.
   
   Also note:The AA package does not free() anything else than what it has itself
   allocated.
