@Update to lynx-2.8.4-rel1, patchset d, now with IPv6 as well

Local patches we maintain to the distribution are:
- replace unbounded fscanf with fgets (avsm)
- spelling fixes (deraadt)
- hppa -O0 workaround (mickey)
- default to ftp passive (deraadt)
- work with non-exec scripts (deraadt,hin,maja)
- be more careful with rlogin username (art)
- default to our webpage (deraadt)
- install helpfiles locally (maja)
- mkdtemp temp space directory (art)
- install more recent config.guess (avsm)
