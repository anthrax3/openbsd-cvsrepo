#
# Prototype Mailcap file
# Note that support for text & multipart are "built in" to metamail,
# as are rudimentary support for message, and application.
# However, any of these may be overridden in mailcap.
#
# Note that users may override or extend this with a .mailcap
# file in their own directory.  However, there is NO NEED
# for them to copy entries from this file, as metamail will
# pick up entries from both the system and personal mailcap files.
#

# NOTE:  This file has been heavily modified for use as an example
#        configuration file for Lynx

# In the samples given   test=test -n "$DISPLAY"   is used to
# determine if the current session is X capable by checking
# for the existence of a DISPLAY environment variable.
# Lynx actually uses a getenv() call for DISPLAY (DECW$DISPLAY
# on VMS) when it encounters   test=test -n "$DISPLAY"  or
# test=test -z "$DISPLAY"  in a viewer assignment, instead of
# spawning to execute "test" via a system() call, i.e., those
# two strings, respectively, are handled equivalently to the
# :XWINDOWS and :NON_XWINDOWS flags for VIEWER: assignments
# in lynx.cfg.  Any system without the DISPLAY (or DECW$DISPLAY)
# environment variable will be assumed to be Non-X.

# You can append a ';' followed by "q=#.#", e.g.,  ; q=0.002
# to set the quality parameter for the Content-Type, which can be
# included in the Accept: header Lynx sends to http servers (the
# default quality value is 1.0, and Lynx appends the parameter
# to the Content-Type only if the value is less than 1.0).

# You can append a ';' followed by "mxb=#", e.g.,  ; mxb=1000000
# to set the maxbytes parameter for the Content-Type, which can be
# included in the Accept: header Lynx sends to http servers (the
# default maxbytes value is 0, meaning no maximum, and Lynx appends
# the parameter to the Content-Type only if the value exceeds 0).

# The following line is for sites where xv understands jpeg but xloadimage 
# is preferred.
#
# the test line specifies that this viewer should only be used if
# the display variable is set.
image/jpeg; xv %s;  test=test -n "$DISPLAY"

# The following sends all other image subtypes to xloadimage
#image/*; xloadimage %s; ;  test=test -n "$DISPLAY"

# The following sends all other image subtypes to xv
image/*; xv %s; ;  test=test -n "$DISPLAY"


# If you have an interactive Postscript interpreter, you should think carefully 
# before replacing lpr with it in the following line, because PostScript
# can be an enormous security hole.  It is RELATIVELY harmless
# when sent to the printer...

# This one is for NON-X
#application/postscript; lpr %s \; echo SENT FILE TO PRINTER; ;test=test -z "$DISPLAY"

# This one is for X.  It's already the default via src/HTInit.c.
#application/postscript; ghostview %s; ;  test=test -n "$DISPLAY"

# The following should be commented out if you do NOT have safe-tcl
# and should be uncommented if you DO have safe-tcl
#application/safe-tcl; swish -safe -messaging -f %s

# A common problem with the mailcap mechanism is getting differential 
# behavior from different programs.  This problem is compounded by the fact 
# that some programs, notably Mosaic, do not implement the "test" clause in 
# mailcap files.  If you are using Lynx and X Mosaic together you should
# place all X-centric entries before non-X entries.  X Mosaic will use
# whichever entry is defined first so further entries will be ignored.
#
# Lynx exports the environment variable LYNX_VERSION, so it can be tested
# by scripts to determine if Lynx is running or not.  However, the string
#   test=test -n "$LYNX_VERSION"
# is handled simply as a flag which yields success when Lynx encounters it
# in the mailcap file (i.e., Lynx does not bother to execute "test" via a
# system() call to find out if it's running, because it obviously is).
# Inclusion of the string for that test can be used to prevent other
# software which reads the mailcap file from acting on assignments intended
# only for Lynx.  The string
#   test=test -z "$LYNX_VERSION"
# similarly is treated by Lynx simply as a flag which yields failure.
