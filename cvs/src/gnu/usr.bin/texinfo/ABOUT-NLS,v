@Notes on the GNU Translation Project
************************************

   GNU is going international!  The GNU Translation Project is a way to
get maintainers, translators, and users all together, so that GNU will
gradually become able to speak many languages.  A few packages already
provide translations for their messages.

   If you found this `ABOUT-NLS' file inside a GNU distribution, you
may assume that the distributed package does use GNU `gettext'
internally, itself available at your nearest GNU archive site.  But you
do *not* need to install GNU `gettext' prior to configuring, installing
or using this package with messages translated.

   Installers will find here some useful hints.  These notes also
explain how users should proceed for getting the programs to use the
available translations.  They tell how people wanting to contribute and
work at translations should contact the appropriate team.

   When reporting bugs in the `intl/' directory or bugs which may be
related to internationalization, you should tell about the version of
`gettext' which is used.  The information can be found in the
`intl/VERSION' file, in internationalized packages.

One advise in advance
=====================

   If you want to exploit the full power of internationalization, you
should configure it using

     ./configure --with-included-gettext

to force usage of internationalizing routines provided within this
package, despite the existence of internationalizing capabilities in
the operating system where this package is being installed.  So far, no
prior implementation provides as many useful features (such as locale
alias or message inheritance).  It is also not possible to offer this
additional functionality on top of a `catgets' implementation.  Future
versions of GNU `gettext' will very likely convey even more
functionality.  So it might be a good idea to change to GNU `gettext'
as soon as possible.

INSTALL Matters
===============

   Some GNU packages are "localizable" when properly installed; the
programs they contain can be made to speak your own native language.
Most such packages use GNU `gettext'.  Other packages have their own
ways to internationalization, predating GNU `gettext'.

   By default, this package will be installed to allow translation of
messages.  It will automatically detect whether the system provides
usable `catgets' (if using this is selected by the installer) or
`gettext' functions.  If neither is available, the GNU `gettext' own
library will be used.  This library is wholly contained within this
package, usually in the `intl/' subdirectory, so prior installation of
the GNU `gettext' package is *not* required.  Installers may use
special options at configuration time for changing the default
behaviour.  The commands:

     ./configure --with-included-gettext
     ./configure --with-catgets
     ./configure --disable-nls

will respectively bypass any pre-existing `catgets' or `gettext' to use
the internationalizing routines provided within this package, enable
the use of the `catgets' functions (if found on the locale system), or
else, *totally* disable translation of messages.

   When you already have GNU `gettext' installed on your system and run
configure without an option for your new package, `configure' will
probably detect the previously built and installed `libintl.a' file and
will decide to use this.  This might be not what is desirable.  You
should use the more recent version of the GNU `gettext' library.  I.e.
if the file `intl/VERSION' shows that the library which comes with this
package is more recent, you should use

     ./configure --with-included-gettext

to prevent auto-detection.

   By default the configuration process will not test for the `catgets'
function and therefore they will not be used.  The reasons are already
given above: the emulation on top of `catgets' cannot provide all the
extensions provided by the GNU `gettext' library.  If you nevertheless
want to use the `catgets' functions use

     ./configure --with-catgets

to enable the test for `catgets' (this causes no harm if `catgets' is
not available on your system).  If you really select this option we
would like to hear about the reasons because we cannot think of any
good one ourself.

   Internationalized packages have usually many `po/LL.po' files, where
LL gives an ISO 639 two-letter code identifying the language.  Unless
translations have been forbidden at `configure' time by using the
`--disable-nls' switch, all available translations are installed
together with the package.  However, the environment variable `LINGUAS'
may be set, prior to configuration, to limit the installed set.
`LINGUAS' should then contain a space separated list of two-letter
codes, stating which languages are allowed.

Using This Package
==================

   As a user, if your language has been installed for this package, you
only have to set the `LANG' environment variable to the appropriate
ISO 639 `LL' two-letter code prior to using the programs in the
package.  For example, let's suppose that you speak German.  At the
shell prompt, merely execute `setenv LANG de' (in `csh'),
`export LANG; LANG=de' (in `sh') or `export LANG=de' (in `bash').  This
can be done from your `.login' or `.profile' file, once and for all.

   An operating system might already offer message localization for
many of its programs, while other programs (whether GNU or not) have
been installed locally with the full capabilities of GNU `gettext'.
Just using `gettext' extended syntax for `LANG' would break proper
localization of already available operating system programs.  In this
case, users should set both `LANGUAGE' and `LANG' variables in their
environment, as programs using GNU `gettext' give preference to
`LANGUAGE'.  For example, some Swedish users would rather read
translations in German than English for when Swedish is not available.
This is easily accomplished by setting `LANGUAGE' to `sv:de' while
leaving `LANG' to `sv'.

Translating Teams
=================

   For the GNU Translation Project to be a success, we need interested
people who like their own language and write it well, and who are also
able to synergize with other translators speaking the same language.
Each translation team has its own mailing list, courtesy of Linux
International.  You may reach your translation team at the address
`LL@@li.org', replacing LL by the two-letter ISO 639 code for your
language.  Language codes are *not* the same as the country codes given
in ISO 3166.  The following translation teams exist, as of February
1997:

     Arabic `ar', Chinese `zh', Czech `cs', Danish `da', Dutch `nl',
     English `en', Esperanto `eo', Finnish `fi', French `fr', German
     `de', Greek `el', Hebrew `he', Hungarian `hu', Irish `ga', Italian
     `it', Indonesian `id', Japanese `ja', Korean `ko', Latin `la',
     Norwegian `no', Persian `fa', Polish `pl', Portuguese `pt',
     Russian `ru', Slovenian `sl', Spanish `es', Swedish `sv', Telugu
     `te', Turkish `tr' and Ukrainian `uk'.

For example, you may reach the Chinese translation team by writing to
`zh@@li.org'.

   If you'd like to volunteer to *work* at translating messages, you
should become a member of the translating team for your own language.
The subscribing address is *not* the same as the list itself, it has
`-request' appended.  For example, speakers of Swedish can send a
message to `sv-request@@li.org', having this message body:

     subscribe

   Keep in mind that team members are expected to participate
*actively* in translations, or at solving translational difficulties,
rather than merely lurking around.  If your team does not exist yet and
you want to start one, or if you are unsure about what to do or how to
get started, please write to `gnu-translation@@gnu.ai.mit.edu' to reach
the GNU coordinator for all translator teams.

   The English team is special.  It works at improving and uniformizing
the terminology used in GNU.  Proven linguistic skill are praised more
than programming skill, here.  For the time being, please avoid
subscribing to the English team unless explicitly invited to do so.

Available Packages
==================

   Languages are not equally supported in all GNU packages.  The
following matrix shows the current state of GNU internationalization,
as of February 1997.  The matrix shows, in regard of each package, for
which languages PO files have been submitted to translation
coordination.

   Some counters in the preceding matrix are higher than the number of
visible blocks let us expect.  This is because a few extra PO files are
used for implementing regional variants of languages, or language
dialects.

   For a PO file in the matrix above to be effective, the package to
which it applies should also have been internationalized and
distributed as such by its maintainer.  There might be an observable
lag between the mere existence a PO file and its wide availability in a
GNU distribution.

   If February 1997 seems to be old, you may fetch a more recent copy
of this `ABOUT-NLS' file on most GNU archive sites.

many features (such as locale alias, message inheritance, automatic
charset conversion or plural form handling) as the implementation here.
It is also not possible to offer this additional functionality on top
of a `catgets' implementation.  Future versions of GNU `gettext' will
very likely convey even more functionality.  So it might be a good idea
to change to GNU `gettext' as soon as possible.

   The configuration process will not test for the `catgets' function
and therefore it will not be used.  The reason is that even an
emulation of `gettext' on top of `catgets' could not provide all the
extensions of the GNU `gettext' library.

`LL_CC' combination.  Here `LL' is an ISO 639 two-letter language code,
and `CC' is an ISO 3166 two-letter country code.  For example, let's
suppose that you speak German and live in Germany.  At the shell
prompt, merely execute `setenv LANG de_DE' (in `csh'),
`export LANG; LANG=de_DE' (in `sh') or `export LANG=de_DE' (in `bash').
This can be done from your `.login' or `.profile' file, once and for
all.

   You might think that the country code specification is redundant.
But in fact, some languages have dialects in different countries.  For
example, `de_AT' is used for Austria, and `pt_BR' for Brazil.  The
country code serves to distinguish the dialects.

   The locale naming convention of `LL_CC', with `LL' denoting the
language and `CC' denoting the country, is the one use on systems based
on GNU libc.  On other systems, some variations of this scheme are
used, such as `LL' or `LL_CC.ENCODING'.  You can get the list of
locales supported by your system for your country by running the command
`locale -a | grep '^LL''.

   Not all programs have translations for all languages.  By default, an
English message is shown in place of a nonexistent translation.  If you
understand other languages, you can set up a priority list of languages.
This is done through a different environment variable, called
`LANGUAGE'.  GNU `gettext' gives preference to `LANGUAGE' over `LANG'
for the purpose of message handling, but you still need to have `LANG'
set to the primary language; this is required by other parts of the
system libraries.  For example, some Swedish users who would rather
read translations in German than English for when Swedish is not
available, set `LANGUAGE' to `sv:de' while leaving `LANG' to `sv_SE'.

   In the `LANGUAGE' environment variable, but not in the `LANG'
environment variable, `LL_CC' combinations can be abbreviated as `LL'
to denote the language's main dialect.  For example, `de' is equivalent
to `de_DE' (German as spoken in Germany), and `pt' to `pt_PT'
(Portuguese as spoken in Portugal) in this context.

   If March 2002 seems to be old, you may fetch a more recent copy of

Using `gettext' in new packages
===============================

   If you are writing a freely available program and want to
internationalize it you are welcome to use GNU `gettext' in your
package.  Of course you have to respect the GNU Library General Public
License which covers the use of the GNU `gettext' library.  This means
in particular that even non-free programs can use `libintl' as a shared
library, whereas only free software can use `libintl' as a static
library or use modified versions of `libintl'.

   Once the sources are changed appropriately and the setup can handle
to use of `gettext' the only thing missing are the translations.  The
Free Translation Project is also available for packages which are not
developed inside the GNU project.  Therefore the information given above
applies also for every other Free Software Project.  Contact
`translation@@iro.umontreal.ca' to make the `.pot' files available to
the translation teams.

Some packages are "localizable" when properly installed; the programs
they contain can be made to speak your own native language.  Most such
packages use GNU `gettext'.  Other packages have their own ways to
internationalization, predating GNU `gettext'.

   Special advice for Norwegian users: The language code for Norwegian
bokma*l changed from `no' to `nb' recently (in 2003).  During the
transition period, while some message catalogs for this language are
installed under `nb' and some older ones under `no', it's recommended
for Norwegian users to set `LANGUAGE' to `nb:no' so that both newer and
older translations are used.
