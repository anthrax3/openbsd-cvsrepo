Texinfo 2
*********

The second edition of the Texinfo manual is now released in a package
with the second version of the various Texinfo support files,
including `texinfo.el', `texnfo-upd.el', and `makeinfo.c'.  The new
manual is considerably larger than the previous one.

Here is a brief description of the new Texinfo mode commands 
and the newly described @@-commands:

New Texinfo Mode Commands
=========================

Texinfo mode provides commands and features especially designed for
working with Texinfo files.  More than 20 new commands have been
added, including commands for automatically creating and updating both
nodes and menus.  This is a tedious task when done by hand.

The keybindings are intended to be somewhat mnemonic.

Update everything
-----------------

The `texinfo-master-menu' command is the primary command:

     C-c C-u m       Create or update a master menu.
                     With an argument, first create or
                     update all nodes and regular menus.

Update Pointers
---------------

Create or update `Next', `Previous', and `Up' node pointers.

     C-c C-u C-n     Update a node.
     C-c C-u C-e     Update every node in the buffer.

Update Menus
------------

Create or update menus.

     C-c C-u C-m     Make or update a menu.

     C-c C-u C-a     Make or update all the menus
                     in a buffer; with an argument, 
                     first update all the nodes.

Insert Title as Description
---------------------------

Insert a node's chapter or section title in the space for the
description in a menu entry line; position point so you can edit the
insert.  (This command works somewhat differently than the other
insertion commands, which insert only a predefined string.)

     C-c C-c C-d     Insert title.

Format for Info
---------------

Provide keybindings both for the Info formatting commands that are
written in Emacs Lisp and for `makeinfo' which is written in C.

Use the Emacs lisp `texinfo-format...' commands:

     C-c C-e C-r     Format the region.
     C-c C-e C-b     Format the buffer.

Use `makeinfo':

     C-c C-m C-r     Format the region.
     C-c C-m C-b     Format the buffer.
     C-c C-m C-l     Recenter the `makeinfo' output buffer.
     C-c C-m C-k     Kill the `makeinfo' formatting job.

Typeset and Print
-----------------

Typeset and print Texinfo documents from within Emacs.

     C-c C-t C-r     Run TeX on the region.
     C-c C-t C-b     Run TeX on the buffer.
     C-c C-t C-i     Run `texindex'.
     C-c C-t C-p     Print the DVI file.
     C-c C-t C-q     Show the print queue.
     C-c C-t C-d     Delete a job from the print queue.
     C-c C-t C-k     Kill the current TeX formatting job.
     C-c C-t C-x     Quit a currently stopped TeX formatting job.
     C-c C-t C-l     Recenter the output buffer.

Other Updating Commands
-----------------------

The `other updating commands' do not have standard keybindings because
they are less frequently used.

     M-x texinfo-insert-node-lines
                     Insert missing node lines using 
                     section titles as node names.

     M-x texinfo-multiple-files-update
                     Update a multi-file document.

     M-x texinfo-indent-menu-description
                     Indent descriptions in menus.

     M-x texinfo-sequential-update-node
                     Insert node pointers in strict sequence.

Newly Described Texinfo @@-Commands
==================================

The second edition of the Texinfo manual describes more than 50
commands that were not described in the first edition.  A third or so
of these commands existed in Texinfo but were not documented in the
manual; the others are new.  Here is a listing, with brief
descriptions of them:


Commands for creating your own index and for merging two indices:

`@@defindex INDEX-NAME'
     Define a new index and its indexing command.  Print entries in a
     roman font.  Also, the `@@defcodeindex' command, which prints
     entries in an `@@code' font.

`@@synindex FROM-INDEX INTO-INDEX'
     Merge the index named in the first argument into the index named
     in the second argument.  Sets FROM-INDEX in the same (roman) font
     as INTO-INDEX.  Also, the `@@syncodeindex' command, which prints
     the entries from the first index in `@@code' font.


Many commands to help you describe functions, variables, macros,
commands, user options, special forms and other such artifacts in a
uniform format.

`@@deffn CATEGORY NAME ARGUMENTS...'
     Format a description for functions, interactive commands, and
     similar entities that may take arguments.  Takes as arguments the
     category of entity being described, the name of this particular
     entity, and its arguments, if any.

`@@defvr, @@defop, ...'
     15 other related commands.


Special symbols to indicate the results of evaluation or an expansion,
printed output, an error message, equivalence of expressions, and the
location of point.

`@@equiv{}'
     Indicate the exact equivalence of two forms; special glyph: `=='.

`@@error{}'
     Indicate that the following text is an error message: `error-->'.

`@@expansion{}'
     Indicate the result of a macro expansion; special glyph: `==>'.

`@@point{}'
     Indicate the position of point; special glyph: `-!-'.

`@@print{}'
     Indicate printed output; special glyph: `-|'.

`@@result{}'
     Indicate the result of an expression; special glyph: `=>'.


Commands to customize headings:

`@@headings ON-OFF-SINGLE-DOUBLE'
     Turn headings on or off, or specify single-sided or double-sided
     headings for printing.

`@@evenfooting [LEFT] @@| [CENTER] @@| [RIGHT]'
     Specify footings for even-numbered (left-hand) pages.  Not
     relevant to Info.

`@@evenheading, @@everyheading, @@oddheading, ...'
     Five other related commands.

`@@thischapter'
     In a heading or footing, stands for the number and name of the
     current chapter, in the format `Chapter 1: First Chapter'.

`@@thischaptername, @@thisfile, @@thistitle, @@thispage'
     Related commands.


Commands for formatting text:

`@@cartouche'   
     Draw rounded box surrounding text (not in Info).

`@@enumerate OPTIONAL-ARG'
     Enumerate a list with letters or numbers.

`@@exdent LINE-OF-TEXT'
     Remove any indentation a line might have.

`@@flushleft'
     Left justify every line but leave the right end ragged.  Leave
     font as is.

`@@flushright'
     Right justify every line but leave the left end ragged.  Leave
     font as is.

`@@format'
     Like `@@example' or `@@display', but do not narrow the margins or
     select the fixed-width font.

`@@ftable FORMATTING-COMMAND'
`@@vtable FORMATTING-COMMAND'
     Begin a two-column table, using `@@item' for each entry.
     `@@ftable' automatically enters each of the items in the 
     first column into the index of functions and `@@vtable'
     enters them into the index of variables.  The commands
     are the same as `@@table', except for indexing.

`@@lisp'
     Indent text, do not fill, select fixed-width font.

`@@smallexample'
     Indent text, do not fill, select fixed-width font.  In
     `@@smallbook' format, print text in a smaller font than with the
     `@@example' environment.  Also, the `@@smalllisp' command.

Commands for formatting if a flag is set or cleared:

`@@set FLAG [STRING]'
     Set FLAG, causing the Texinfo formatting commands to format text
     between subsequent pairs of `@@ifset FLAG' and `@@end ifset'
     commands.  Optionally, set value of FLAG to STRING.

`@@value{FLAG}'
     Replace with value to which FLAG is set.

`@@ifset FLAG ... @@end ifset'
     If FLAG is set, the Texinfo formatting commands format text
     between `@@ifset FLAG' and the following `@@end ifset' command.

`@@clear FLAG'
     Unset FLAG, preventing the Texinfo formatting commands from
     formatting text between subsequent pairs of `@@ifset FLAG' and
     `@@end ifset' commands.

`@@ifclear FLAG ... @@end ifclear'
     If FLAG is unset, the Texinfo formatting commands format text
     between `@@ifclear FLAG' and the following `@@end ifclear' command.

Produce unnumbered headings that do not appear in a table of contents:

`@@heading TITLE'
     Print an unnumbered section-like heading in the text, but not in
     the table of contents of a printed manual.

`@@chapheading, @@majorheading'
`@@subheading, @@subsubheading'
     Related commands.


Font commands:

`@@r{TEXT}'
     Print TEXT in roman font.  No effect in Info.

`@@sc{TEXT}'
     Set TEXT in the printed output in THE SMALL CAPS FONT and set
     text in the Info file in uppercase letters.


Miscellaneous:

`@@author AUTHOR'
     Typeset author's name flushleft and underline it.

`@@finalout'
     Prevent TeX from printing large black warning rectangles beside
     over-wide lines.

`@@footnotestyle STYLE'
     Specify footnote style, end or separate.

`@@dmn{DIMENSION}'
     Format a dimension.

`@@minus{}'
     Generate a minus sign.

`@@paragraphindent INDENT'
     Specify paragraph indentation, asis or a number.

`@@ref{NODE-NAME, [ENTRY], [TOPIC], [INFO-FILE], [MANUAL]}'
     Make a reference.  In the printed manual, the reference does not
     start with a `See'.

`@@title TITLE'
     Alternative format for a title page.  In the printed manual, set
     a title flush to the left-hand side of the page in a larger than
     normal font and underline it with a black rule.  Also,
     `@@subtitle' command.
               
`@@subtitle SUBTITLE'
     Subtitle in the alternative title page format.

`@@today{}'
     Insert the current date.

Here is the separate NEWS for old releases of Info:

Version 2.11,     Sat Apr  1 09:15:21 1995

Changes since 2.7 beta:

Although the basic code remains the same, there are numerous nits
fixed, including some display bugs, and a memory leak.  Some changes
that have taken place with larger impact include the way in which the
(dir) node is built; I have added in support for "localdir"
directories among other things.  Info files may be stored in
compressed formats, and in their own subdirectories; menu items which
do not explicitly name the node to which they are attached have the
menu item name looked up as an Info file if it is not found within the
current document.  This means that the menu item:

* Info::		The Info documentation reader.

in (dir) refers to the info node "(info)Top".

Please see the ChangeLog and documentation for details on other
changes.

Version 2.7 beta, Wed Dec 30 02:02:38 1992
Version 2.6 beta, Tue Dec 22 03:58:07 1992
Version 2.5 beta, Tue Dec  8 14:50:35 1992

Version 2.2 beta, Tue Nov 24 09:36:08 1992
Version 2.1 beta, Tue Nov 17 23:29:36 1992

Changes since 2.5 beta:

Note that versions 2.6 and 2.7 Beta were only released to a select group.

* "info-" removed from the front of M-x commands.

* Automatic footnote display.  When you enter a node which contains
  footnotes, and the variable "automatic-footnotes" is "On", Info pops
  up a window containing the footnotes.  Likewise, when you leave that
  node, the window containing the footnotes goes away.

* Cleaner built in documentation, and documentation functions.

  Use:
    o `M-x describe-variable' to read a variable's documenation
    o `M-x describe-key' to find out what a particular keystroke does.
    o `M-x describe-function' to read a function's documentation.
    o `M-x where-is' to find out what keys invoke a particular function.

* Info can "tile" the displayed windows (via "M-x tile-windows").  If
  the variable "automatic-tiling" is "On", then splitting a window or
  deleting a window causes the remaining windows to be retiled.

* You can save every keystroke you type in a "dribble file" by using the
  `--dribble FILENAME' option.  You can initially read keystrokes from an
  alternate input stream with `--restore FILENAME', or by redirecting
  input on the command line `info < old-dribble'.

* New behaviour of menu items.  If the label is the same as the
  target node name, and the node couldn't be found in the current file,
  treat the label as a file name.  For example, a menu entry in "DIR"
  might contain:

    * Emacs::		Cool text-editor.

  Info would not find the node "(dir)Emacs", so just plain "(emacs)"
  would be tried.

* New variable "ISO-Latin" allows you to use European machines with
  8-bit character sets.

* Cleanups in echo area reading, and redisplay.  Cleanups in handling the
  window which shows possible completions.

* Info can now read files that have been compressed.  An array in filesys.c
  maps extensions to programs that can decompress stdin, and write the results
  to stdout.  Currently, ".Z"/uncompress, ".z"/gunzip, and ".Y"/unyabba are
  supported.  The modeline for a compressed file shows "zz" in it.

* There is a new variable "gc-compressed-files" which, if non-zero, says
  it is okay to reclaim the file buffer space allocated to a file which
  was compressed, if, and only if, that file's contents do not appear in
  any history node.

* New file `nodemenu.c' implements a few functions for manipulating
  previously visited nodes.  `C-x C-b' (list-visited-nodes) produces a
  menu of the nodes that could be reached by info-history-node in some
  window.  `C-x b' (select-visited-node) is similar, but reads one of
  the node names with completion.

* Keystroke `M-r' (move_to_screen_line) allows the user to place the cursor at
  the start of a specific screen line.  Without a numeric argument, place the
  cursor on the center line; with an arg, place the cursor on that line.

* Interruptible display implemented.  Basic display speedups and hacks.
* The message "*** Tags Out of Date ***" now means what it says.
* Index searching with `,' (info-index-next) has been improved.
* When scrolling with C-v, C-M-v, or M-v, only "Page Only" scrolling
  will happen.

* Continous scrolling (along with `]' (info-global-next) and `['
  (info-global-prev) works better.  `]' and `[' accept numeric
  arguments, moving that many nodes in that case.

* `C-x w' (info-toggle-wrap) controls how lines wider than the width
  of the screen are displayed.  If a line is too long, a `$' is
  displayed in the rightmost column of the window.

* There are some new variables for controlling the behaviour of Info
  interactively.  The current list of variables is as follows:

  Variable Name      Default Value  Description
  -------------      -------------  -----------
  `automatic-footnotes' On	    When "On", footnotes appear and
				    disappear automatically.

  `automatic-tiling'    Off	    When "On", creating of deleting a
				    window resizes other windows.

  `visible-bell'        Off	    If non-zero, try to use a visible bell.

  `errors-ring-bell'    On	    If non-zero, errors cause a ring.

  `show-index-match'    On	    If non-zero, the portion of the string
				    matched is highlighted by changing its
				    case.

  `scroll-behaviour'    Continuous  One of "Continuous", "Next Only", or
				    "Page Only".  "Page Only" prevents you from
				    scrolling past the bottom or top of a node.
				    "Next Only" causes the Next or Prev node to
				    be selected when you scroll past the bottom
				    or top of a node.  "Continous" moves
				    linearly through the files hierchichal
				    structure.

  `scroll-step'	        0	    Controls how scrolling is done for you when
				    the cursor moves out of the current window.
				    Non-zero means it is the number of lines
				    you would like the screen to shift.  A
				    value of 0 means to center the line
				    containing the cursor in the window.

  `gc-compressed-files' Off	    If non-zero means it is okay to reclaim the
				    file buffer space allocated to a file which
				    was compressed, if, and only if, that
				    file's contents do not appear in the node
				    list of any window.

  `ISO-Latin'	        Off	    Non-zero means that you are using an ISO
				    Latin character set.  By default, standard
				    ASCII characters are assumed.

*** IMPORTANT NEWS FOR ALL AUTHORS OF TEXINFO MANUALS ***

As of version 4.2, Texinfo has a new command @@copying to define the
copyright and copying permissions for a manual.  It's important to
switch to using it as soon as possible (as in your next release),
because the historical method of doing copyright permissions using
@@ifinfo failed to output copyright information in the HTML (or XML)
formats.  The manual has detailed explanations and examples.  For
convenience, here's a url to one of the relevant sections:
  http://texinfo.org/manual/Document-Permissions.html



4.2 (1 April 2002)
* Language:
  . new command @@copying to define copying permissions.  See above.
  . new conditionals @@ifplaintext, @@ifnotplaintext for the plain text
    (--no-headers) output format.
  . new command @@\ to produce literal \ inside @@math, since \ by itself
    no longer works.
* makeinfo:
  . emit accesskey attributes for keyboard shortcuts to menu items.
  . @@{even,every,odd}{footing,header} are ignored by makeinfo now, so
    they no longer need to be enclosed in @@iftex.
* texinfo.tex:
  . bug fix for pdf-format table of contents.
* info:
  . bug fixes for -R (--raw-escapes).
  . --help shows short option names.
* Distribution:
  . the doc.c, funs.h, and key.c files in info/ are no longer generated
    at make time, to appease Automake's make distcheck.
  . gettext 0.11.1, autoconf 2.53, automake 1.6 (with install-info kludge).



4.1 (4 March 2002)
* Language:
  . new commands @@verbatim and @@verb for printing verbatim inserts.
  . new command @@verbatiminclude for verbatim include of files.
  . new environment @@documentdescription for defining the HTML description.
  . new command @@afivepaper for the A5 paper size.
* makeinfo:
  . supports xml and docbook output.
  . supports HTML splitting by node, which is now the default.
  . new option --split-size to control maximum size of split info files.
* info:
  . user-specified key bindings supported.
  . ANSI escape sequences (as produced by groff) removed from man output
    by default; use --raw-escapes to let them through if your terminal
    supports them.
* texinfo.tex:
  . @@math implies @@tex, so all the usual plain TeX math is supported.
  . smaller fonts for @@smallexample, in all page sizes.
  . improvements in the PDF support.
* texi2dvi:
  . new option -o to explicitly specify output filename.
* Distribution:
  . switch to GNU Free Documentation License (http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/).
  . update to GNU gettext 0.11, autoconf 2.52, and automake 1.5.
  . Danish, Swedish, and Hebrew message translations.

4.8 (31 December 2004)
* Language:
  . new command @@euro for the Euro currency symbol, and
    @@documentencoding has some support for ISO-8859-15.
  . new command @@abbr for general abbreviations.
  . new command @@slanted to typeset text in a slanted font,
    and @@sansserif to typeset in a sans serif font.
* makeinfo:
  . An empty first argument to cross-reference commands, such as @@xref,
    causes an error.  This change was made in 4.1, but not mentioned in NEWS.
  . HTML output:
    - <a name="..."> constructs are added for the old-style
      conversion of node names to HTML names, so that external references
      to them can continue to work.
    - "g_t" prefixed to targets for node names beginning with a
      nonletter, for XHTML compatibility.
  . Docbook output: recognize more image formats.
* texi2dvi:
  . new option --recode, to call recode for input character translation.
* Distribution:
  . new convenience script texi2pdf, equivalent to texi2dvi --pdf (from tetex).
  . some cross-compiling support in configure && make.
  . new configure option --disable-install-warnings, for TeX.
    distributions which do have the files installed.
  . automake 1.9.4.


4.7 (9 April 2004)
* Language:
  . new commands @@float, @@caption, @@shortcaption, @@listoffloats for
    initial implementation of floating material (figures, tables, etc).
    Ironically, they do not yet actually float anywhere.
  . new commands @@docbook, @@ifdocbook, @@ifnotdocbook for conditional Docbook.
  . new commands @@ordf{} and @@ordm{} for Spanish feminine/masculine ordinals.
  . new commands @@deftypecv[x] for class variables in typed OO languages.
  . new command @@registeredsymbol for the r-in-a-circle symbol.
  . new command @@headitem to make a heading row in @@multitable.
  . new command @@LaTeX{} for the LaTeX logo.
  . new command @@comma{} to avoid comma-parsing problems.
  . @@url is now a synonym for @@uref; new command @@indicateurl has the
    old meaning of just displaying a url as text.
  . @@quotation now accepts an optional argument for labelling the text
      as a `Note', `Tip', etc.
  . @@defun (et al.) heading lines can now be continued with a lone @@.
  . @@acronym accepts an optional argument for the meaning of the acronym.
* makeinfo:
  . New environment variable TEXINFO_OUTPUT_FORMAT determines the output
    format at runtime, if no options are specified.
  . New option --plaintext, equivalent to --no-headers with Info output.
  . All outputs:
    - sections are numbered by default.
  . Info output:
    - punctuation is inserted after @@pxref and @@ref, if needed to make
      cross-references valid.
    - line numbers included in index menus, so Info readers can go to
      the exact line of an entry, not just a node.  Also in plaintext output.
    - ^@@^H[index^@@^H] cookie included in index menus, so Info readers
      can handle the ] etc. commands better.
  . HTML output:
    - new algorithm for cross-references to other manuals, for maximum
      portability and stability.
    - include node name in <title> with split output.
    - @@multicolumn fractions become percentages.
    - entities used for bullets, quotes, dashes, and others.
    - index entries are links to the exact locations.
    - <h4> and <h5> used for @@sub and @@subsubsections again.
    - accented dotless i supported.
  . XML output: many new tags and structure to preserve more source features.
  . Docbook output:
    - upgraded DTD to Docbook XML 4.2, no longer using Docbook SGML.
    - improved translation in general, for instance:
    - line annotations and marked quotations.
* texi2dvi:
  . if available, use etex (pdfetex if --pdf) by default.
  . if the input file includes thumbpdf.sty (for LaTeX), then run thumbpdf.
  . more output if --debug.
* texinfo.tex:
  . @@defun names are now printed in typewriter (instead of bold), and
    within the arguments, @@var text is printed in slanted typewriter.
  . @@tex code is executed inside a TeX group, so that any changes must
    be prefixed with \global (or the equivalent) to be effective.  (This
    change was actually made years ago, but never made it into the NEWS.)
* info:
  . new option --where (aka --location, -w) to report where an Info file
    would be found, instead of reading it.
  . by default, output ANSI terminal escape sequences as-is; new option
    --no-raw-escapes overrides this.
  . use the newly-generated index line numbers.
* Distribution:
  . new script gendocs.sh (not installed), for use by GNU maintainers in
    getting their manuals on the GNU web site.  Documented in
    maintain.texi (http://www.gnu.org/prep/maintain/).
  . Most code uses ANSI C prototypes, to some extent.
  . New translation: nb.
  . automake 1.8.3, autoconf 2.59, gettext 0.14.1.


4.6 (10 June 2003)
* Language:
  . new command @@/ specifies an allowable breakpoint within a line.
  . new command @@dofirstparagraphindent to control whether the first
    paragraph following a section heading is indented.  Default is to
    omit this indentation, unlike the output up to now.
  . new command @@indent for explicitly indenting a paragraph.
  . makeinfo writes a new construct for @@image in Info output, so that
    graphical Info browsers (such as Emacs Info under X) can display an
    actual image.  (Standalone Info ignores this, since it runs in a tty.)
* makeinfo:
  . Common:
    - search for image files in the include file search path.
    - warns if @@value is used on an undefined variable.
  . Info output:
    - default --split-size now 300,000 bytes, up from 50,000.
    - with --enable-encoding and a given @@documentencoding,
      output a Local Variables section specifying that encoding, for use
      with Emacs.
  . HTML output:
    - uses <h3> at the smallest.
    - a few css <style> definitions are included to better
      implement @@format, @@display, @@small..., etc.
    - new option --css-include=FILE includes FILE in the <style>.
    - @@cartouche now outputs a <table> with a border.
* texinfo.tex:
  . new Polish translation txi-pl.tex.
* texi2dvi:
  . --command=CMD replaces --texinfo=CMD; it inserts CMD at the first
    line of LaTeX files now, or after the @@setfilename for Texinfo files.
* info:
  . RET now goes to the nearest xref (rather like Emacs Info),
    instead of the next xref starting on the current line.
* Distribution:
  . new Romanian (ro) translation.
  . variables now declared const where appropriate.
  . gettext 0.12.1, automake 1.7.5.


4.5 (4 February 2003)
* info:
  . a bug in 4.4 prevented compressed info files from being found.
* Distribution:
  . detect sys/ptem.h on Solaris.


4.4 (31 January 2003)
* Language:
  . The ' (ASCII apostrophe/right quote) character is finally allowed in
    node and anchor names.  Thus, after installing this texinfo.tex,
    existing .aux files will cause errors!  Remove them and rerun TeX to
    generate good ones.
  . @@value constructs are now expanded in the filename arguments to
    @@include and @@verbatiminclude.
* makeinfo:
  . @@macro names may no longer include ^ or _, for the sake of math mode.
  . bug fix: @@copying text is now reflected in tag table positions;
    before, nodes may not have been found with a long-enough @@copying.
  . bug fix: html @@verb arg is quoted properly, and does not imply
    a paragraph break.
* texinfo.tex:
  . @@smallexample and the like now output in a smaller font (9pt) in all
    paper formats, not just @@smallbook and @@afourpaper.
  . new translation txi-tr.tex.
  . bug fix: <>| and other characters do not disappear when they are
    first on a line in @@verbatim.
* install-info:
  . bug fix: don't translate the `* Menu' info keyword.
* info:
  . CTRL-H is treated like DEL in incremental search.
  . arrow keys once again work in isearch contexts under Solaris.
* infokey:
  . use .info key bindings before defaults.
  . allow prefix keys to be disabled.
* Distribution:
  . update to GNU FDL 1.2 (http://www.gnu.org/licenses/fdl.html).
  . getopt and other common library files updated from gnulib
    (http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/gnulib/).
  . autoconf 2.57, automake 1.7.2.


4.3 (14 November 2002)
* Language:
  . new command @@tie{} to do a real tie (unbreakable interword space).
* makeinfo:
  . html output for @@defun and friends now has font changes.
  . html output has some class attributes.
  . xml and docbook output improved in many details.
* texinfo.tex:
  . new Italian translations, txi-it.tex.
  . pdf bookmarks for unnumbered sections work.
  . type name for @@defun and friends no longer extends into margin.
* info:
  . automatic-footnotes now off by default, for emacs compatibility.
