* Makeinfo:
  - HTML output.
  - A detexinfo program, like detex or delatex.  This command would
    strip all the texinfo commands out, and would be used as a filter on
    the way to a speller.  An option would be to NOT strip comments out.
    makeinfo --no-headers comes close.
  - If node name contains an @@ command, complain explicitly.
  - Better ASCII output: convert menus to single table of contents,
    enumerate chapters and sections, convert cross-refs and indices to
    chapter/section references.  See:
       ftp://ftp.simtel.net/pub/simtelnet/gnu/djgpp/v2/faq201s.zip

n* TeX:
  - Use @@ as the escape character, and Texinfo syntax generally, in the
    table of contents, aux, and index files.  Eliminate all the crazy
    multiple redefinitions of every Texinfo command in different contexts.
  - Handle @@hsep and @@vsep in @@multitables.

* General:
  - Better i18n support, including support for 8-bit input characters,
    and 8-bit output in info.  Perhaps have to use the ec fonts.
  - Support compressed image files, automatic generation of .txt
    or .jpg from .eps by Ghostscript.
  - Repeat TeX run until cross-references stabilize, not just twice.
    (Document this in manual and fix texi2dvi.)
  - Handle reference card creation, perhaps by only paying attention to
    sectioning and @@def... commands.
  - Allow : in node names for info files, for names like `class::method'.
  - Get Info declared as a MIME Content-Type.

* Language:
  - @@figure:
@@figure [xref-label]
@@figureinclude <filename>, [<height>], [<width>]
@@figurehsize <dimen>
@@figurevsize <dimen>
@@caption ... @@end caption
<arbitrary Texinfo commands>
@@end figure
  - @@flushboth to combine @@flushleft and @@flushright, for RFC's.
  - @@part sectioning command.
  - Anchors a la HTML?
  - Allow subitems and `see' and `see also' in indices.
  - @@exercise/@@answer command for, e.g., gawk.
  - Allow @@hsep/@@vsep at @@item, instead of just in template.
  - The dark corner symbol for the gawk manual.
  - Change bars.  This is difficult or impossible in TeX,
    unfortunately.  To do it right requires device driver support.

* Doc:
  - Include a complete functional summary, as in a reference card, in
    the manual.
  - Improve the manuals for makeinfo, standalone info, etc.
  - Page 39, need a new section on doing dedication pages. See gawk.texi
    for an example of doing it in both the tex and info versions.

* Info:
  - Search all nodes of dir file at startup, then can have
    INFO-DIR-SEPARATE-GROUPS and other such.
  - Better dir file merging.
  - Steal interface ideas from Lynx: TAB for navigating to next link
    within a page, number links, etc.
  - q within help should quit help like C-x 0.
  - Full-text search on all available info files.
  - Incorporate an X-based viewer, perhaps tkinfo:
    http://www.math.ucsb.edu/~boldt/tkinfo/.
  - Perhaps process Texinfo files directly instead of converting to Info:
    ftp://ftp.cs.berkeley.edu/ucb/people/phelps/tcltk/tkman.tar.Z
    + ftp://ftp.cs.berkeley.edu/ucb/people/phelps/tcltk/rman.tar.Z
    + Tcl/Tk 8.0 from ftp.smli.com in the /pub/tcl directory.
    From: phelps@@ecstasy.CS.Berkeley.EDU (Tom Phelps)

* Install-info:
  - be able to copy the info file to compile-time $(infodir), to
    simplify by-hand installation.

Ideas that will not be implemented:
- Process Texinfo files directly instead of converting to Info:
  ftp://ftp.cs.berkeley.edu/ucb/people/phelps/tcltk/tkman.tar.Z, which
  uses Tcl/Tk 8.0 from ftp.smli.com in the /pub/tcl directory.
  From: phelps@@ecstasy.CS.Berkeley.EDU (Tom Phelps)
  [This has the disadvantage of needing to be updated when the
  Texinfo language changes, so don't.]

- Split HTML output by chapter.
  [Then cross-references in HTML cannot be generated consistently.]

  - Support installation of manuals in different languages, along these lines:
    . support a LINGUAS file or variable saying which subdirs LL in the
      source to descend into (under doc/).
    . within each subdir LL, install the info files into $infodir/LL,
      and run install-info on $infodir/LL/dir.
    . info (both emacs and standalone) should read $infodir/$LANG/dir
      as the first dir file, and likewise read info files first from
      $infodir/$LANG, before falling back to $infodir.
    . consider ways to avoid installing images in both places.
      In fact, images probably need to be installed in a subdir
      $infodir/MANUAL/ in the first place, to avoid conflicts of having
      the same image name in different manuals.
    For a test case, see texinfo cvs, with its one translated manual
    (info-fr.texi).
    From Wojciech Polak.
  - Monitor and improve the dir categories in existing manuals,
    following the Free Software Directory categories.  Much mail to
    developers has already been sent, what's needed now is to check new
    releases and make sure they are using the right categories.
    See the util/dir-example in the Texinfo distribution for our current
    recommended categories.
    For background, see the thread (which discusses a lot of other
    issues too) at
    http://mail.gnu.org/pipermail/emacs-devel/2002-10/msg00011.html,

  - Get Info declared as a MIME Content-Type.
  - Likewise the `info:' URI scheme; a library consortium has proposed a
    completely different purpose for the URI scheme, but I don't know
    how to send comments, despite it being a "request for comments".  Sigh.

  - Glossary/general definition support (dumas msg 28 Nov 2003 17:09:57 +0100).
  - Add support for other Latin 9 (and Latin 2 and Latin 1) characters.

* Makeinfo:
  - Translation of "Appendix" etc. should depend on @@doclang not $LANG.
  - Try directory of main source file.
  - Make makeinfo -E just do macro expansion, avoiding all error checks.
    That way, texi2dvi could run makeinfo --iftex -E.
  - A detexinfo program, like detex or delatex.  This command would
    strip all the texinfo commands out, and would be used as a filter on
    the way to a speller.  An option would be to NOT strip comments out.
    makeinfo --no-headers comes close.
  - If node name contains an @@ command, complain explicitly.
  - Use @@documentlanguage instead of LANG for many translations.
  - HTML: split output by chapter to improve context, per Akim.
    Generate dummy files for all nodes for the sake of cross-references.
  - HTML: support thumbnails.
  - HTML: make images of math, maybe.
  - HTML: allow settable background color, table colors and spacing,
    <head> meta tags, etc.  A la http://texi2html.cvshome.org.  In fact:
  - HTML: have a library of different CSS styles.
    http://mail.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-texinfo/2004-01/msg00025.html
  - XML: cannot be loaded directly in a browser; why not?
  - Docbook: &euro; and other entities do not work; does anything work?
  - Rewrite completely to simplify generation of different formats.

* TeX:
  - Use @@ as the escape character, and Texinfo syntax generally, in the
    table of contents and index files.  Eliminate all the crazy
    multiple redefinitions of every Texinfo command in different contexts.
  - Support input in any encoding and language, via ec or Latin Modern fonts.
  - Reasonable way to change fonts from the default (some work has been

  - read source file (specified by new option) for @@documentlanguage
    and/or @@documentencoding, and change the sorting appropriately.

  - generate txi-??.tex from .po's to make translators' jobs easier.

- Call Ghostscript to get ASCII/jpg output for the @@image command.
  [makeinfo should not try to be make, or assume it knows how the user
   wants to generate images.  Too many different methods are possible.]

- Change bars.  This is difficult or impossible in TeX,
  unfortunately.  To do it right requires device driver support.
  wdiff or ediff may be all we can do.  Merely specifying what should be
  changed is not obvious.
