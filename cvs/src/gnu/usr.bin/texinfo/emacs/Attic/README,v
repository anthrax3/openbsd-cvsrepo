@As of 3.12, emacs files are no longer shipped with texinfo.
Refer to the emacs distribution for up-to-date versions of those.

@This directory contains Emacs Lisp sources related to Texinfo.

M-x texinfo-format-buffer is no longer the standard way to make .info
files, and may or may not work.  Use makeinfo instead.  See the
`makeinfo advantages' in the manual for why.

The files here may or may not be newer than the versions in the latest
Emacs distribution -- there is only one master source, so it simply
depends on what was released later.  Use whatever works better for you.

They are not compiled or installed by default, because of the above, and
also due to the wide variations in sites' Emacs installations.

Even if you do install them, you may not want to compile them if your
site is running multiple versions of Emacs, since .elc files are not
portable between all Emacs releases.  If you do want to compile them,
just run the ./elisp-comp shell script.
