@Texinfo, Version 3
==================

This is the README file for version 3 of the Texinfo distribution.
Files within this distribution have their own version and edition
numbers.  When you refer to a file, please mention its own number.

PLEASE REPORT BUGS TO: bug-texinfo@@prep.ai.mit.edu

23 March 1993

Texinfo is a documentation system that uses a single source file to
produce both on-line information and printed output.  This means that
instead of writing two different documents, one for the on-line help
or other on-line information and the other for a typeset manual or
other printed work, you need write only one document.  When the work
is revised, you need revise only one document.  You can read the
on-line information, known as an "Info file", with an Info
documentation-reading program.  By convention, Texinfo source file
names end with a `.texi' or `.texinfo' extension.  Texinfo is
described in the Texinfo Manual.

You can write and format Texinfo files into Info files within GNU
Emacs, and read them using the Emacs Info reader.  If you do not have
Emacs, you can format Texinfo files into Info files using `makeinfo'
and read them using `info'.  Use TeX, which is not included in this
package, to typeset Texinfo files for printing.

For instructions on installing info, makeinfo, texi2dvi, and texindex,
please read the file `INSTALL'.  The Emacs Lisp files are not
installed by default; to install them, use `make install' in the
`emacs' subdirectory.

This distribution includes (but is not limited to) the following files:

    README                      This file.

    INTRODUCTION                This file tells you how to create
                                readable files from the Texinfo source
                                files in this distribution.

Texinfo source files:

    texinfo.texi                This manual describes Texinfo.  It
                                tells how to use Texinfo to write
                                documentation, how to use Texinfo mode
                                in GNU Emacs, how to use TeX,
                                makeinfo, and the Emacs Lisp Texinfo
                                formatting commands.

    info.texi                   This manual tells you how to use 
                                Info.  This document comes as part of
                                GNU Emacs.  If you do not have Emacs,
                                you can format this Texinfo source
                                file with makeinfo or TeX and then
                                read the resulting Info file with the
                                standalone Info reader that is part of
                                this distribution.

    info-stnd.texi              This manual tells you how to use
                                the standalone GNU Info reader that is
                                included in this distribution as a C
                                source file, `info.c'.

    makeinfo.texi               This manual tells you how to use
                                makeinfo.  The same information is
                                contained in a chapter of the Texinfo
                                manual; it has been extracted here for
                                your convenience.


Printing related files:

    texinfo.tex                 This TeX definitions file tells
                                the TeX program how to typeset a
                                Texinfo file into a DVI file ready for
                                printing.

    texindex.c                  This file contains the source for
                                the `texindex' program that generates
                                sorted indices used by TeX when
                                typesetting a file for printing.

    texi2dvi                    This is a shell script for
                                producing an indexed DVI file using
                                TeX and texindex.


GNU Emacs related files:

    texinfmt.el                 This Emacs Lisp file provides the
                                functions that GNU Emacs uses to
                                format a Texinfo file into an Info
                                file.

    texinfo.el                  This file provides Texinfo mode
                                for GNU Emacs.

    texnfo-upd.el               These files provides commands to
    texnfo-tex.el               help you write Texinfo files
    makeinfo.el                 using GNU Emacs Texinfo mode.

    detexinfo.el                This extra utility file contains functions 
                                to remove Texinfo commands from a
                                Texinfo source file.

    info.el                     These are the standard GNU Emacs
    informat.el                 Info reading and support files,
                                included here for your convenience.
 

Source files for standalone C programs:

    makeinfo.c                  This file contains the source for
                                the `makeinfo' program that you can
                                use to create an Info file from a
                                Texinfo file.

    info.c                      This file contains the source for
                                the `info' program that you can use to
                                view Info files on an ASCII terminal.

    getopt.c                    Various support files
    getopt1.c
    getopt.h


C Installation files:

    configure                   This file creates creates a Makefile 
                                which in turn creates an `info' or
                                `makeinfo' executable, or a C sources
                                distribution.

    configure.in                This is a template for creating

    Makefile.in                 This is a template for `configure' 
                                to use to make a Makefile.
                               

Other files:

    NEWS                        This contains a summary of new
                                features since the first edition 
                                of Texinfo.

    info.1                      This is a `man' page that briefly 
                                describes the standalone `info'
                                program.

    fixfonts                    This is a shell script to install the 
                                `lcircle10' TeX fonts as an alias for
                                the `circle10' fonts.  In some older
                                TeX distributions the names are
                                different.

    tex3patch                   This handles a bug for version
                                3.0 of TeX that does not occur in
                                more recent versions.

`How to Obtain TeX' in the Texinfo manual for information), to typeset
Texinfo files for printing.

For instructions on compiling and installing info, makeinfo, texi2dvi,

The primary distribution point is ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/texinfo/.

Mailing lists:
- bug-texinfo@@gnu.org for bug reports or enhancement suggestions,
  archived at ftp://ftp-mailing-list-archives.gnu.org/.
- help-texinfo@@gnu.org for authoring questions and general discussion.
  archived at the same place.
- texinfo-pretest@@tug.org for pretests of new releases,
  archived at http://tug.org/archives/texinfo-pretest/.
There are as yet no corresponding newsgroups.

For bug reports, please include enough information for the maintainers
to reproduce the problem.  Generally speaking, that means:
- the version number of Texinfo and the program(s) involved (use --version).
- hardware, operating system, and compiler versions (uname -a).
- any unusual options you gave to configure (see config.status).
- the contents of any input files necessary to reproduce the bug (crucial!).
- a description of the problem and any samples of the erroneous output.
- anything else that you think would be helpful.

Patches are most welcome; if possible, please make them with diff -c and
include ChangeLog entries.

When sending email, please do not encode or split the messages in any
way if at all possible; it's much easier to deal with one large message
than many small ones.  GNU shar is a convenient way of packaging
multiple and/or binary files for email.

* The Info tree uses a file `dir' as its root node; the `dir-example'
  file in this distribution is included as a possible starting point.
  Use it, modify it, or ignore it just as you like.

* You can create a file texinfo.cnf to be read by TeX when
  processing Texinfo manuals.  For example, you might like to use
  @@afourpaper by default.  See the `Preparing for TeX' node in
  texinfo.txi for more details.  You don't have to create the file if
  you have nothing to put in it.

* If your info files are not in $prefix/info, you may wish to add a line
#define DEFAULT_INFOPATH "/mydir1:/mydir2:..."
  to config.h after running configure.

* For instructions on compiling this distribution with DJGPP tools
  for MS-DOS and MS-Windows, please see the file djgpp/README.


If you would like to contribute to the GNU project by implementing
additional documentation output formats for Texinfo, that would be
great.  But please do not write a separate translator texi2foo for your
favorite format foo!  That is the hard way to do the job, and makes
extra work in subsequent maintenance, since the Texinfo language is
continually being enhanced and updated.  Instead, the best approach is
modify Makeinfo to generate the new format, as it does now for Info and HTML.
