@#===-- Makefile.common - Common make rules for LLVM --------*- Makefile -*--===#
#
#                     The LLVM Compiler Infrastructure
#
# This file is distributed under the University of Illinois Open Source
# License. See LICENSE.TXT for details.
#
#===------------------------------------------------------------------------===#
#
# This file is included by all of the LLVM makefiles.  This file defines common
# rules to do things like compile a .cpp file or generate dependency info.
# These are platform dependent, so this is the file used to specify these
# system dependent operations.
#
# The following functionality can be set by setting incoming variables.
# The variable $(LEVEL) *must* be set:
#
# 1. LEVEL - The level of the current subdirectory from the top of the
#    source directory.  This level should be expressed as a path, for
#    example, ../.. for two levels deep.
#
# 2. DIRS - A list of subdirectories to be built.  Fake targets are set up
#    so that each of the targets "all", "install", and "clean" each build
#    the subdirectories before the local target.  DIRS are guaranteed to be
#    built in order.
#
# 3. PARALLEL_DIRS - A list of subdirectories to be built, but that may be
#    built in any order.  All DIRS are built in order before PARALLEL_DIRS are
#    built, which are then built in any order.
#
# 4. SOURCES - If specified, this sets the source code filenames.  If this
#    is not set, it defaults to be all of the .cpp, .c, .y, and .l files
#    in the current directory.
#
# 5. SourceDir - If specified, this specifies a directory that the source files
#    are in, if they are not in the current directory.  This should include a
#    trailing / character.
#
# 6. LLVM_SRC_ROOT - If specified, points to the top of the LLVM source tree.
#
# 8. PROJ_SRC_DIR - The directory which contains the current set of Makefiles
#    and usually the source code too (unless SourceDir is set).
#
# 9. PROJ_SRC_ROOT - The root directory of the source code being compiled.
#
# 10. PROJ_OBJ_DIR - The directory where object code should be placed.
#
# 11. PROJ_OBJ_ROOT - The root directory for where object code should be
#     placed.
#
# For building,
# 	LLVM, LLVM_SRC_ROOT = PROJ_SRC_ROOT
#
#===-----------------------------------------------------------------------====

#
# Configuration file to set paths specific to local installation of LLVM
#
