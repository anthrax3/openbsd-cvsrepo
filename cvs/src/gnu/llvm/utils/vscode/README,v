@This directory contains a "bundle" for doing syntax highlighting of TableGen
files for the Microsoft VSCode editor. The highlighting follows that done by
the TextMate "C" bundle as it is a translation of the textmate bundle to VSCode
using the "yo code" npm package. Currently, keywords, comments, and strings are
highlighted.

This colorizer was generate by the vscode-generator tool "Yo Code"
(https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-generator-code) from the existing TableGen
text TableGen.tmLanguage syntax colorizer in utils/textmate. This README was
copied from utils/textmate/README.

To install this VSCode .td file colorizer, copy it to the following locations
per your Operating System:

  - Windows: %USERPROFILE%\.vscode\extensions
  - Mac: ~/.vscode/extensions
  - Linux: ~/.vscode/extensions
