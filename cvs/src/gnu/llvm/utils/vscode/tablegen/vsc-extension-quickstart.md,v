@# Welcome to your VS Code Extension

## What's in the folder
* This folder contains all of the files necessary for your extension
* `package.json` - this is the manifest file in which you declare your language support and define
the location of the grammar file that has been copied into you extension.
* `syntaxes/TableGen.tmLanguage` - this is the Text mate grammar file that is used for tokenization
* `language-configuration.json` - this the language configuration, defining the tokens that are used for
comments and brackets.

## Get up and running straight away
* Make sure the language configuration settings in `language-configuration.json` are accurate
* press `F5` to open a new window with your extension loaded
* create a new file with a file name suffix matching your language
* verify that syntax highlight works and that the language configuration settings are working

## Make changes
* you can relaunch the extension from the debug toolbar after making changes to the files listed above
* you can also reload (`Ctrl+R` or `Cmd+R` on Mac) the VS Code window with your extension to load your changes

## Add more language features
* To add features such as intellisense, hovers and validators check out the VS Code extenders documentation at
https://code.visualstudio.com/docs

## Install your extension
* To start using your extension with Visual Studio Code copy it into the `<user home>/.vscode/extensions` folder and restart Code.
* To share your extension with the world, read on https://code.visualstudio.com/docs about publishing an extension.@
