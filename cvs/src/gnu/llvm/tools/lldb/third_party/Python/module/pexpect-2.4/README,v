@Pexpect is a Pure Python Expect-like module

Pexpect makes Python a better tool for controlling other applications.

Pexpect is a pure Python module for spawning child applications; controlling
them; and responding to expected patterns in their output. Pexpect works like
Don Libes' Expect. Pexpect allows your script to spawn a child application and
control it as if a human were typing commands.

Pexpect can be used for automating interactive applications such as ssh, ftp,
passwd, telnet, etc. It can be used to a automate setup scripts for
duplicating software package installations on different servers. It can be
used for automated software testing. Pexpect is in the spirit of Don Libes'
Expect, but Pexpect is pure Python. Unlike other Expect-like modules for
Python, Pexpect does not require TCL or Expect nor does it require C
extensions to be compiled. It should work on any platform that supports the
standard Python pty module. The Pexpect interface was designed to be easy to use.

If you want to work with the development version of the source code then please
read the DEVELOPERS document in the root of the source code tree.

Free, open source, and all that good stuff.
