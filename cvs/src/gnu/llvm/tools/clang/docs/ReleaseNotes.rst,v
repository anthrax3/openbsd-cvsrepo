Clang 3.8 Release Notes
=======================

.. contents::
   :local:
   :depth: 2

Written by the `LLVM Team <http://llvm.org/>`_

Introduction
============

This document contains the release notes for the Clang C/C++/Objective-C
frontend, part of the LLVM Compiler Infrastructure, release 3.8. Here we
describe the status of Clang in some detail, including major
improvements from the previous release and new feature work. For the
general LLVM release notes, see `the LLVM
documentation <../../../docs/ReleaseNotes.html>`_. All LLVM
releases may be downloaded from the `LLVM releases web
site <http://llvm.org/releases/>`_.

For more information about Clang or LLVM, including information about
the latest release, please check out the main please see the `Clang Web
Site <http://clang.llvm.org>`_ or the `LLVM Web
Site <http://llvm.org>`_.

What's New in Clang 3.8?
========================

Some of the major new features and improvements to Clang are listed
here. Generic improvements to Clang as a whole or to its underlying
infrastructure are described first, followed by language-specific
sections with improvements to Clang's support for those languages.

Improvements to Clang's diagnostics
-----------------------------------

Clang's diagnostics are constantly being improved to catch more issues,
explain them more clearly, and provide more accurate source information
about them. The improvements since the 3.7 release include:

- ``-Wmicrosoft`` has been split into many targeted flags, so that projects can
  choose to enable only a subset of these warnings. ``-Wno-microsoft`` still
  disables all these warnings, and ``-Wmicrosoft`` still enables them all.

New Compiler Flags
------------------

Clang can "tune" DWARF debugging information to suit one of several different
debuggers. This fine-tuning can mean omitting DWARF features that the
debugger does not need or use, or including DWARF extensions specific to the
debugger. Clang supports tuning for three debuggers, as follows.

- ``-ggdb`` is equivalent to ``-g`` plus tuning for the GDB debugger. For
  compatibility with GCC, Clang allows this option to be followed by a
  single digit from 0 to 3 indicating the debugging information "level."
  For example, ``-ggdb1`` is equivalent to ``-ggdb -g1``.

- ``-glldb`` is equivalent to ``-g`` plus tuning for the LLDB debugger.

- ``-gsce`` is equivalent to ``-g`` plus tuning for the Sony Computer
  Entertainment debugger.

Specifying ``-g`` without a tuning option will use a target-dependent default.

The new ``-fstrict-vtable-pointers`` flag enables better devirtualization
support (experimental).


Alignment
---------
Clang has gotten better at passing down strict type alignment information to LLVM,
and several targets have gotten better at taking advantage of that information.

Dereferencing a pointer that is not adequately aligned for its type is undefined
behavior.  It may crash on target architectures that strictly enforce alignment, but
even on architectures that do not, frequent use of unaligned pointers may hurt
the performance of the generated code.

If you find yourself fixing a bug involving an inadequately aligned pointer, you
have several options.

The best option, when practical, is to increase the alignment of the memory.
For example, this array is not guaranteed to be sufficiently aligned to store
a pointer value:

.. code-block:: c

  char buffer[sizeof(const char*)];

Writing a pointer directly into it violates C's alignment rules:

.. code-block:: c

  ((const char**) buffer)[0] = "Hello, world!\n";

But you can use alignment attributes to increase the required alignment:

.. code-block:: c

  __attribute__((aligned(__alignof__(const char*))))
  char buffer[sizeof(const char*)];

When that's not practical, you can instead reduce the alignment requirements
of the pointer.  If the pointer is to a struct that represents that layout of a
serialized structure, consider making that struct packed; this will remove any
implicit internal padding that the compiler might add to the struct and
reduce its alignment requirement to 1.

.. code-block:: c

  struct file_header {
    uint16_t magic_number;
    uint16_t format_version;
    uint16_t num_entries;
  } __attribute__((packed));

You may also override the default alignment assumptions of a pointer by
using a typedef with explicit alignment:

.. code-block:: c

  typedef const char *unaligned_char_ptr __attribute__((aligned(1)));
  ((unaligned_char_ptr*) buffer)[0] = "Hello, world!\n";

The final option is to copy the memory into something that is properly
aligned.  Be aware, however, that Clang will assume that pointers are
properly aligned for their type when you pass them to a library function
like memcpy.  For example, this code will assume that the source and
destination pointers are both properly aligned for an int:

.. code-block:: c

  void copy_int_array(int *dest, const int *src, size_t num) {
    memcpy(dest, src, num * sizeof(int));
  }

You may explicitly disable this assumption by casting the argument to a
less-aligned pointer type:

.. code-block:: c

  void copy_unaligned_int_array(int *dest, const int *src, size_t num) {
    memcpy((char*) dest, (const char*) src, num * sizeof(int));
  }

Clang promises not to look through the explicit cast when inferring the
alignment of this memcpy.


C Language Changes in Clang
---------------------------

Better support for ``__builtin_object_size``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Clang 3.8 has expanded support for the ``__builtin_object_size`` intrinsic.
Specifically, ``__builtin_object_size`` will now fail less often when you're
trying to get the size of a subobject. Additionally, the ``pass_object_size``
attribute was added, which allows ``__builtin_object_size`` to successfully
report the size of function parameters, without requiring that the function be
inlined.


``overloadable`` attribute relaxations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Previously, functions marked ``overloadable`` in C would strictly use C++'s
type conversion rules, so the following code would not compile:

.. code-block:: c

  void foo(char *bar, char *baz) __attribute__((overloadable));
  void foo(char *bar) __attribute__((overloadable));

  void callFoo() {
    int a;
    foo(&a);
  }

Now, Clang is able to selectively use C's type conversion rules during overload
resolution in C, which allows the above example to compile (albeit potentially
with a warning about an implicit conversion from ``int*`` to ``char*``).

OpenCL C Language Changes in Clang
----------------------------------

Several OpenCL 2.0 features have been added, including:

- Command-line option ``-std=CL2.0``.

- Generic address space (``__generic``) along with new conversion rules
  between different address spaces and default address space deduction.

- Support for program scope variables with ``__global`` address space.

- Pipe specifier was added (although no pipe functions are supported yet).

- Atomic types: ``atomic_int``, ``atomic_uint``, ``atomic_long``,
  ``atomic_ulong``, ``atomic_float``, ``atomic_double``, ``atomic_flag``,
  ``atomic_intptr_t``, ``atomic_uintptr_t``, ``atomic_size_t``,
  ``atomic_ptrdiff_t`` and their usage with C11 style builtin functions.

- Image types: ``image2d_depth_t``, ``image2d_array_depth_t``,
  ``image2d_msaa_t``, ``image2d_array_msaa_t``, ``image2d_msaa_depth_t``,
  ``image2d_array_msaa_depth_t``.

- Other types (for pipes and device side enqueue): ``clk_event_t``,
  ``queue_t``, ``ndrange_t``, ``reserve_id_t``.

Several additional features/bugfixes have been added to the previous standards:

- A set of floating point arithmetic relaxation flags: ``-cl-no-signed-zeros``,
  ``-cl-unsafe-math-optimizations``, ``-cl-finite-math-only``,
  ``-cl-fast-relaxed-math``.

- Added ``^^`` to the list of reserved operations.

- Improved vector support and diagnostics.

- Improved diagnostics for function pointers.

OpenMP Support in Clang
-----------------------

OpenMP 3.1 is fully supported and is enabled by default with ``-fopenmp`` 
which now uses the Clang OpenMP library instead of the GCC OpenMP library.
The runtime can be built in-tree.  

In addition to OpenMP 3.1, several important elements of the OpenMP 4.0/4.5 
are supported as well. We continue to aim to complete OpenMP 4.5

- ``map`` clause
- task dependencies
- ``num_teams`` clause
- ``thread_limit`` clause
- ``target`` and ``target data`` directive
- ``target`` directive with implicit data mapping
- ``target enter data`` and ``target exit data`` directive
- Array sections [2.4, Array Sections].
- Directive name modifiers for ``if`` clause [2.12, if Clause].
- ``linear`` clause can be used in loop-based directives [2.7.2, loop Construct].
- ``simdlen`` clause [2.8, SIMD Construct].
- ``hint`` clause [2.13.2, critical Construct].
- Parsing/semantic analysis of all non-device directives introduced in OpenMP 4.5.

The codegen for OpenMP constructs was significantly improved allowing us to produce much more stable and fast code.
Full test cases of IR are also implemented.

CUDA Support in Clang
---------------------
Clang has experimental support for end-to-end CUDA compilation now:

- The driver now detects CUDA installation, creates host and device compilation
  pipelines, links device-side code with appropriate CUDA bitcode and produces
  single object file with host and GPU code.

- Implemented target attribute-based function overloading which allows Clang to
  compile CUDA sources without splitting them into separate host/device TUs.

Internal API Changes
--------------------

These are major API changes that have happened since the 3.7 release of
Clang. If upgrading an external codebase that uses Clang as a library,
this section should help get you past the largest hurdles of upgrading.

* With this release, the autoconf build system is deprecated. It will be removed
  in the 3.9 release. Please migrate to using CMake. For more information see:
  `Building LLVM with CMake <http://llvm.org/docs/CMake.html>`_

AST Matchers
------------
The AST matcher functions were renamed to reflect the exact AST node names,
which is a breaking change to AST matching code. The following matchers were
affected:

=======================	============================
Previous Matcher Name	New Matcher Name
=======================	============================
recordDecl		recordDecl and cxxRecordDecl
ctorInitializer		cxxCtorInitializer
constructorDecl		cxxConstructorDecl
destructorDecl		cxxDestructorDecl
methodDecl		cxxMethodDecl
conversionDecl		cxxConversionDecl
memberCallExpr		cxxMemberCallExpr
constructExpr		cxxConstructExpr
unresolvedConstructExpr	cxxUnresolvedConstructExpr
thisExpr		cxxThisExpr
bindTemporaryExpr	cxxBindTemporaryExpr
newExpr			cxxNewExpr
deleteExpr		cxxDeleteExpr
defaultArgExpr		cxxDefaultArgExpr
operatorCallExpr	cxxOperatorCallExpr
forRangeStmt		cxxForRangeStmt
catchStmt		cxxCatchStmt
tryStmt			cxxTryStmt
throwExpr		cxxThrowExpr
boolLiteral		cxxBoolLiteral
nullPtrLiteralExpr	cxxNullPtrLiteralExpr
reinterpretCastExpr	cxxReinterpretCastExpr
staticCastExpr		cxxStaticCastExpr
dynamicCastExpr		cxxDynamicCastExpr
constCastExpr		cxxConstCastExpr
functionalCastExpr	cxxFunctionalCastExpr
temporaryObjectExpr	cxxTemporaryObjectExpr
CUDAKernalCallExpr	cudaKernelCallExpr
=======================	============================

recordDecl() previously matched AST nodes of type CXXRecordDecl, but now
matches AST nodes of type RecordDecl. If a CXXRecordDecl is required, use the
cxxRecordDecl() matcher instead.


Static Analyzer
---------------

The scan-build and scan-view tools will now be installed with Clang. Use these
tools to run the static analyzer on projects and view the produced results.

Static analysis of C++ lambdas has been greatly improved, including
interprocedural analysis of lambda applications.

Several new checks were added:

- The analyzer now checks for misuse of ``vfork()``.
- The analyzer can now detect excessively-padded structs. This check can be
  enabled by passing the following command to scan-build:
  ``-enable-checker optin.performance.Padding``.
- The checks to detect misuse of ``_Nonnull`` type qualifiers as well as checks
  to detect misuse of Objective-C generics were added.
- The analyzer now has opt in checks to detect localization errors in Cocoa
  applications. The checks warn about uses of non-localized ``NSStrings``
  passed to UI methods expecting localized strings and on ``NSLocalizedString``
  macros that are missing the comment argument. These can be enabled by passing
  the following command to scan-build:
  ``-enable-checker optin.osx.cocoa.localizability``.


Clang-tidy

- Clang will no longer pass ``--build-id`` by default to the linker. In modern
  linkers that is a relatively expensive option. It can be passed explicitly
  with ``-Wl,--build-id``. To have clang always pass it, build clang with
  ``-DENABLE_LINKER_BUILD_ID``.
- On Itanium ABI targets, attribute abi_tag is now supported for compatibility
  with GCC. Clang's implementation of abi_tag is mostly compatible with GCC ABI
  version 10.

the precompiled header flags are honored.  But if the precompiled header is
included by an ``#include <stdafx.h>`` in each source file instead of by a
``/FIstdafx.h`` flag, these flag continue to be ignored.

clang-cl has a new flag, ``/imsvc <dir>``, for adding a directory to the system

C++1z Feature Support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
d191 1
a191 2
Clang's experimental support for the upcoming C++1z standard can be enabled with ``-std=c++1z``.
Changes to C++1z features since Clang 3.8:
d193 2
a194 5
- The ``[[fallthrough]]``, ``[[nodiscard]]``, and ``[[maybe_unused]]`` attributes are
  supported in C++11 onwards, and are largely synonymous with Clang's existing attributes
  ``[[clang::fallthrough]]``, ``[[gnu::warn_unused_result]]``, and ``[[gnu::unused]]``.
  Use ``-Wimplicit-fallthrough`` to warn on unannotated fallthrough within ``switch``
  statements.
d196 1
a196 1
- In C++1z mode, aggregate initialization can be performed for classes with base classes:
d198 1
a198 1
  .. code-block:: c++
d200 4
a203 3
    struct A { int n; };
    struct B : A { int x, y; };
    B b = { 1, 2, 3 }; // b.n == 1, b.x == 2, b.y == 3
d205 3
a207 2
- The range in a range-based ``for`` statement can have different types for its ``begin``
  and ``end`` iterators. This is permitted as an extension in C++11 onwards.
d209 2
a210 2
- Lambda-expressions can explicitly capture ``*this`` (to capture the surrounding object
  by copy). This is permitted as an extension in C++11 onwards.
d212 1
a212 3
- Objects of enumeration type can be direct-list-initialized from a value of the underlying
  type. ``E{n}`` is equivalent to ``E(n)``, except that it implies a check for a narrowing
  conversion.
d214 3
a216 2
- Unary *fold-expression*\s over an empty pack are now rejected for all operators
  other than ``&&``, ``||``, and ``,``.
d218 1

OpenCL C Language Changes in Clang
----------------------------------
d220 1
a220 2
Clang now has support for all OpenCL 2.0 features.  In particular, the following
features have been completed since the previous release:
d222 1
a222 45
- Pipe builtin functions (s6.13.16.2-4).
- Dynamic parallelism support via the ``enqueue_kernel`` Clang builtin function,
  as well as the kernel query functions from s6.13.17.6. 
- Address space conversion functions ``to_{global/local/private}``.
- ``nosvm`` attribute support.
- Improved diagnostic and generation of Clang Blocks used in OpenCL kernel code.
- ``opencl_unroll_hint`` pragma.

Several miscellaneous improvements have been made:

- Supported extensions are now part of the target representation to give correct
  diagnostics for unsupported target features during compilation. For example,
  when compiling for a target that does not support the double precision
  floating point extension, Clang will give an error when encountering the
  ``cl_khr_fp64`` pragma. Several missing extensions were added covering up to
  and including OpenCL 2.0.
- Clang now comes with the OpenCL standard headers declaring builtin types and
  functions up to and including OpenCL 2.0 in ``lib/Headers/opencl-c.h``. By
  default, Clang will not include this header. It can be included either using
  the regular ``-I<path to header location>`` directive or (if the default one
  from installation is to be used) using the ``-finclude-default-header``
  frontend flag.

  Example:

  .. code-block:: none

    echo "bool is_wg_uniform(int i){return get_enqueued_local_size(i)==get_local_size(i);}" > test.cl
    clang -cc1 -finclude-default-header -cl-std=CL2.0 test.cl

  All builtin function declarations from OpenCL 2.0 will be automatically
  visible in test.cl.
- Image types have been improved with better diagnostics for access qualifiers.
  Images with one access qualifier type cannot be used in declarations for
  another type. Also qualifiers are now propagated from the frontend down to
  libraries and backends.
- Diagnostic improvements for OpenCL types, address spaces and vectors.
- Half type literal support has been added. For example, ``1.0h`` represents a
  floating point literal in half precision, i.e., the value ``0xH3C00``.
- The Clang driver now accepts OpenCL compiler options ``-cl-*`` (following the
  OpenCL Spec v1.1-1.2 s5.8). For example, the ``-cl-std=CL1.2`` option from the
  spec enables compilation for OpenCL 1.2, or ``-cl-mad-enable`` will enable
  fusing multiply-and-add operations.
- Clang now uses function metadata instead of module metadata to propagate
  information related to OpenCL kernels e.g. kernel argument information.
d225 1
a225 1
----------------------------------
d227 45
a271 11
Added support for all non-offloading features from OpenMP 4.5, including using
data members in private clauses of non-static member functions. Additionally,
data members can be used as loop control variables in loop-based directives.

Currently Clang supports OpenMP 3.1 and all non-offloading features of
OpenMP 4.0/4.5. Offloading features are under development. Clang defines macro
_OPENMP and sets it to OpenMP 3.1 (in accordance with OpenMP standard) by
default. User may change this value using ``-fopenmp-version=[31|40|45]`` option.

The codegen for OpenMP constructs was significantly improved to produce much
more stable and faster code.
d275 40
a315 7
- has and hasAnyArgument: Matchers no longer ignore parentheses and implicit
  casts on the argument before applying the inner matcher. The fix was done to
  allow for greater control by the user. In all existing checkers that use this
  matcher all instances of code ``hasAnyArgument(<inner matcher>)`` or
  ``has(<inner matcher>)`` must be changed to
  ``hasAnyArgument(ignoringParenImpCasts(<inner matcher>))`` or
  ``has(ignoringParenImpCasts(<inner matcher>))``.
d320 90
a409 16
The analyzer now checks for incorrect usage of MPI APIs in C and C++. This
check can be enabled by passing the following command to scan-build:
``-enable-checker optin.mpi.MPI-Checker.``

The analyzer now checks for improper instance cleanup up in Objective-C
``-dealloc`` methods under manual retain/release.

On Windows, checks for memory leaks, double frees, and use-after-free problems
are now enabled by default.

The analyzer now includes scan-build-py, an experimental reimplementation of
scan-build in Python that also creates compilation databases.

The scan-build tool now supports a ``--force-analyze-debug-code`` flag that
forces projects to analyze in debug mode. This flag leaves in assertions and so
typically results in fewer false positives.

- The ``diagnose_if`` attribute has been added to clang. This attribute allows
  clang to emit a warning or error if a function call meets one or more
  user-specified conditions.

- Enhanced devirtualization with
  `-fstrict-vtable-pointers <UsersManual.html#cmdoption-fstrict-vtable-pointers>`_.
  Clang devirtualizes across different basic blocks, like loops:

  .. code-block:: c++

       struct A {
           virtual void foo();
       };
       void indirect(A &a, int n) {
           for (int i = 0 ; i < n; i++)
               a.foo();
       }
       void test(int n) {
           A a;
           indirect(a, n);
       }

Improvements to ThinLTO (-flto=thin)
------------------------------------
- Integration with profile data (PGO). When available, profile data enables
  more accurate function importing decisions, as well as cross-module indirect
  call promotion.
- Significant build-time and binary-size improvements when compiling with debug
  info (-g).

**The following bugs in the OpenCL header have been fixed:**
d158 2
a159 2
* Added missing ``overloadable`` and ``convergent`` attributes.
* Removed some erroneous extra ``native_*`` functions.
d161 1
a161 1
**The following bugs in the generation of metadata have been fixed:**
d163 7
a169 62
* Corrected the SPIR version depending on the OpenCL version.
* Source level address spaces are taken from the SPIR specification.
* Image types now contain no access qualifier.

**The following bugs in the AMD target have been fixed:**

* Corrected the bitwidth of ``size_t`` and NULL pointer value with respect to
  address spaces.
* Added ``cl_khr_subgroups``, ``cl_amd_media_ops`` and ``cl_amd_media_ops2``
  extensions.
* Added ``cl-denorms-are-zero`` support.
* Changed address spaces for image objects to be ``constant``.
* Added little-endian.

**The following bugs in OpenCL 2.0 have been fixed:**

* Fixed pipe builtin function return type, added extra argument to generated
  IR intrinsics to propagate size and alignment information of the pipe packed
  type.
* Improved pipe type to accommodate access qualifiers.
* Added correct address space to the ObjC block generation and ``enqueue_kernel``
  prototype.
* Improved handling of integer parameters of ``enqueue_kernel`` prototype. We
  now allow ``size_t`` instead of ``int`` for specifying block parameter sizes.
* Allow using NULL (aka ``CLK_NULL_QUEUE``) with ``queue_t``.


**Improved the following diagnostics:**

* Disallow address spaces other than ``global`` for kernel pointer parameters.
* Correct the use of half type argument and pointer assignment with
  dereferencing.
* Disallow variadic arguments in functions and blocks.
* Allow partial initializer for array and struct.

**Some changes to OpenCL extensions have been made:**

* Added ``cl_khr_mipmap_image``.
* Added ``-cl-ext`` flag to allow overwriting supported extensions otherwise
  set by the target compiled for (Example: ``-cl-ext=-all,+cl_khr_fp16``).
* New types and functions can now be flexibly added to extensions using the
  following pragmas instead of modifying the Clang source code:

  .. code-block:: c

       #pragma OPENCL EXTENSION the_new_extension_name : begin
       // declare types and functions associated with the extension here
       #pragma OPENCL EXTENSION the_new_extension_name : end


**Miscellaneous changes:**

* Fix ``__builtin_astype`` to cast between different address space objects.
* Allow using ``opencl_unroll_hint`` with earlier OpenCL versions than 2.0.
* Improved handling of floating point literal to default to single precision if
  fp64 extension is not enabled.
* Refactor ``sampler_t`` implementation to simplify initializer representation
  which is now handled as a compiler builtin function with an integer value
  passed into it.
* Change fake address space map to use the SPIR convention.
* Added `the OpenCL manual <UsersManual.html#opencl-features>`_ to Clang
  documentation.

a192 13
- The analyzer warns when virtual calls are made from constructors or
  destructors. This check is off by default but can be enabled by passing the
  following command to scan-build: ``-enable-checker optin.cplusplus.VirtualCall``.
- The analyzer checks for synthesized copy properties of mutable types in
  Objective C, such as ``NSMutableArray``. Calling the setter for these properties
  will store an immutable copy of the value.
- The analyzer checks for calls to ``dispatch_once()`` that use an Objective-C
  instance variable as the predicate. Using an instance variable as a predicate
  may result in the passed-in block being executed multiple times or not at all.
  These calls should be rewritten either to use a lock or to store the predicate
  in a global or static variable.
- The analyzer checks for unintended comparisons of ``NSNumber``, ``CFNumberRef``, and
  other Cocoa number objects to scalar values.
