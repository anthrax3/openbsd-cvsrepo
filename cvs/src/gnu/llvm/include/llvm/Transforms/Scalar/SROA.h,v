/// \brief An optimization pass providing Scalar Replacement of Aggregates.
///
/// This pass takes allocations which can be completely analyzed (that is, they
/// don't escape) and tries to turn them into scalar SSA values. There are
/// a few steps to this process.
///
/// 1) It takes allocations of aggregates and analyzes the ways in which they
///    are used to try to split them into smaller allocations, ideally of
///    a single scalar data type. It will split up memcpy and memset accesses
///    as necessary and try to isolate individual scalar accesses.
/// 2) It will transform accesses into forms which are suitable for SSA value
///    promotion. This can be replacing a memset with a scalar store of an
///    integer value, or it can involve speculating operations on a PHI or
///    select to be a PHI or select of the results.
/// 3) Finally, this will try to detect a pattern of accesses which map cleanly
///    onto insert and extract operations on a vector value, and convert them to
///    this form. By doing so, it will enable promotion of vector aggregates to
///    SSA vector values.
