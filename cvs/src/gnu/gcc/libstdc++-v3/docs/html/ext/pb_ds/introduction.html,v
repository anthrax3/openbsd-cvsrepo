    <h1>Introduction</h1>

    <p>This section describes what problems the library attempts to
    solve. <a href="motivation.html">Motivation</a> describes the
    reasons we think it solves these problems better than similar
    libraries.</p>

    <h2><a name="assoc" id="assoc">Associative Containers</a></h2>

    <ol>
      <li>Associative containers depend on their policies to a very
      large extent. Implicitly hard-wiring policies can hamper their
      performance and limit their functionality. An efficient
      hash-based container, for example, requires policies for
      testing key equivalence, hashing keys, translating hash
      values into positions within the hash table, and determining
      when and how to resize the table internally. A tree-based
      container can efficiently support order statistics,
      <i>i.e.</i>, the ability to query what is the order of each
      key within the sequence of keys in the container, but only if
      the container is supplied with a policy to internally update
      meta-data. There are many other such examples.<p></p></li>

      <li>Ideally, all associative containers would share the same
      interface. Unfortunately, underlying data structures and
      mapping semantics differentiate between different containers.
      For example, suppose one writes a generic function
      manipulating an associative container <tt>Cntnr</tt>:
        <pre>
template&lt;typename Cntnr&gt;
  void
  some_op_sequence(Cntnr&amp; r_cnt)
  {
    ...
  }
</pre>

then what can one assume about <tt>Cntnr</tt>? The answer
varies according to its underlying data structure. If the
underlying data structure of <tt>Cntnr</tt> is based on a tree or
trie, then the order of elements is well defined; otherwise, it is
not, in general. If the underlying data structure of <tt>Cntnr</tt>
is based on a collision-chaining hash table, then modifying
r_<tt>Cntnr</tt> will not invalidate its iterators' order; if the
underlying data structure is a probing hash table, then this is not
the case. If the underlying data structure is based on a tree or
trie, then <tt>r_cnt</tt> can efficiently be split; otherwise, it
cannot, in general. If the underlying data structure is a red-black
tree, then splitting <tt>r_cnt</tt> is exception-free; if it is an
ordered-vector tree, exceptions can be thrown.
      <p></p></li>
    </ol>

    <h2><a name="pq" id="pq">Priority Queues</a></h2>

    <p>Priority queues are useful when one needs to efficiently
    access a minimum (or maximum) value as the set of values
    changes.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Most useful data structures for priority queues have a
      relatively simple structure, as they are geared toward
      relatively simple requirements. Unfortunately, these structures
      do not support access to an arbitrary value, which turns out to
      be necessary in many algorithms. Say, decreasing an arbitrary
      value in a graph algorithm. Therefore, some extra mechanism is
      necessary and must be invented for accessing arbitrary
      values. There are at least two alternatives: embedding an
      associative container in a priority queue, or allowing
      cross-referencing through iterators. The first solution adds
      significant overhead; the second solution requires a precise
      definition of iterator invalidation. Which is the next
      point...<p></p></li>

      <li>Priority queues, like hash-based containers, store values in
      an order that is meaningless and undefined externally.  For
      example, a <tt>push</tt> operation can internally reorganize the
      values. Because of this characteristic, describing a priority
      queues' iterator is difficult: on one hand, the values to which
      iterators point can remain valid, but on the other, the logical
      order of iterators can change unpredictably.<p></p></li>

      <li>Roughly speaking, any element that is both inserted to a
      priority queue (<i>e.g.</i>, through <tt>push</tt>) and removed
      from it (<i>e.g.</i>, through <tt>pop</tt>), incurs a
      logarithmic overhead (in the amortized sense). Different
      underlying data structures place the actual cost differently:
      some are optimized for amortized complexity, whereas others
      guarantee that specific operations only have a constant
      cost. One underlying data structure might be chosen if modifying
      a value is frequent (Dijkstra's shortest-path algorithm),
      whereas a different one might be chosen
      otherwise. Unfortunately, an array-based binary heap - an
      underlying data structure that optimizes (in the amortized
      sense) <tt>push</tt> and <tt>pop</tt> operations, differs from
      the others in terms of its invalidation guarantees. Other design
      decisions also impact the cost and placement of the overhead, at
      the expense of more difference in the the kinds of operations
      that the underlying data structure can support. These
      differences pose a challenge when creating a uniform interface
      for priority queues.<p></p></li>
