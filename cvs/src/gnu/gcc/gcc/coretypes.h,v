/* Provide forward declarations of core types which are referred to by
   most of the compiler.  This allows header files to use these types
   (e.g. in function prototypes) without concern for whether the full
   definitions are visible.  Some other declarations that need to be
   universally visible are here, too.

   In the context of tconfig.h, most of these have special definitions
   which prevent them from being used except in further type
   declarations.  This is a kludge; the right thing is to avoid
   including the "tm.h" header set in the context of tconfig.h, but
   we're not there yet.  */
