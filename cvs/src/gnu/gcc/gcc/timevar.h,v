/* Timing variables are used to measure elapsed time in various
   portions of the compiler.  Each measures elapsed user, system, and
   wall-clock time, as appropriate to and supported by the host
   system.

   Timing variables are defined using the DEFTIMEVAR macro in
   timevar.def.  Each has an enumeral identifier, used when referring
   to the timing variable in code, and a character string name.

   Timing variables can be used in two ways:

     - On the timing stack, using timevar_push and timevar_pop.
       Timing variables may be pushed onto the stack; elapsed time is
       attributed to the topmost timing variable on the stack.  When
       another variable is pushed on, the previous topmost variable is
       `paused' until the pushed variable is popped back off.

     - As a standalone timer, using timevar_start and timevar_stop.
       All time elapsed between the two calls is attributed to the
       variable.
*/

/* This structure stores the various varieties of time that can be
   measured.  Times are stored in seconds.  The time may be an
   absolute time or a time difference; in the former case, the time
   base is undefined, except that the difference between two times
   produces a valid time difference.  */
