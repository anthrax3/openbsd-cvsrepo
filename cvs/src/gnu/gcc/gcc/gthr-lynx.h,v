/* When using static libc on LynxOS, we cannot define pthread_create
   weak.  If the multi-threaded application includes iostream.h,
   gthr-posix.h is included and pthread_create will be defined weak.
   If pthead_create is weak its defining module in libc is not
   necessarily included in the link and the symbol is resolved to zero.
   Therefore the first call to it will crash.

   Since -mthreads is a multilib switch on LynxOS we know that at this
   point we are compiling for multi-threaded.  Omitting the weak
   definitions at this point should have no effect.  */
