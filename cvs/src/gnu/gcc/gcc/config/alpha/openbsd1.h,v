1.1
log
@Merge from gcc3 our configuration for alpha, including these local
changes:

* Do not force -msmall-data if -fpic and -mlarge-data if -fPIC.
Instead, have both -fpic and -fPIC only select pic code generation,
and use whatever memory mode is specified (with -mlarge-data being
the implicit default).

* -Wstack-larger-than support.

* Disable stack frame checking in the prologue under OpenBSD, unless
you compile with -fstack-check, for consistency with other platforms.

* -mno-ieee option to disable IEEE mode.
