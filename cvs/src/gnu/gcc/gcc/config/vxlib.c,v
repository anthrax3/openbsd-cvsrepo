   This would be a clone of the implementation from gthr-solaris.h,
   except that we have a bootstrap problem - the whole point of this
   exercise is to prevent double initialization, but if two threads
   are racing with each other, once->mutex is liable to be initialized
   by both.  Then each thread will lock its own mutex, and proceed to
   call the initialization routine.

   So instead we use a bare atomic primitive (vxTas()) to handle
   mutual exclusion.  Threads losing the race then busy-wait, calling
   taskDelay() to yield the processor, until the initialization is
   completed.  Inefficient, but reliable.  */

/* Thread-local storage.

   We reserve a field in the TCB to point to a dynamically allocated
   array which is used to store TLS values.  A TLS key is simply an
   offset in this array.  The exact location of the TCB field is not
   known to this code nor to vxlib.c -- all access to it indirects
   through the routines __gthread_get_tls_data and
   __gthread_set_tls_data, which are provided by the VxWorks kernel.

   There is also a global array which records which keys are valid and
   which have destructors.

   A task delete hook is installed to execute key destructors.  The
   routines __gthread_enter_tls_dtor_context and
   __gthread_leave_tls_dtor_context, which are also provided by the
   kernel, ensure that it is safe to call free() on memory allocated
   by the task being deleted.  (This is a no-op on VxWorks 5, but
   a major undertaking on AE.)

   The task delete hook is only installed when at least one thread
   has TLS data.  This is a necessary precaution, to allow this module
   to be unloaded - a module with a hook can not be removed.

   Since this interface is used to allocate only a small number of
   keys, the table size is small and static, which simplifies the
   code quite a bit.  Revisit this if and when it becomes necessary.  */
