1.1
log
@A port of the current gcc 3.3.6 m88k backend to gcc 4.2.1.

Main features:
- md constraints rewritten in RTL
- md predicaties rewritten in RTL
- md va_arg switched to gimple
- abort() calls replaced with gcc_assert() or gcc_unreachable() for better
  diagnostics
- support for non-ELF systems completely removed

Missing:
- conversion of the pipeline information from define_function_unit to
  define_automata not done yet (thus pipeline information currently removed)

Known regressions against 3.3.6 so far:
- no stack protector support yet
- __builtin_setjmp doesn't restore the frame pointer correctly upon return
  from __builtin_longjmp
- at least one case of optimization error when delay slots are not disabled.
- libgcc is only built -fPIC, instead of static/fpic/fPIC.
