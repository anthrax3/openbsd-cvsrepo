   It's not possibly to reliably mmap a file using MAP_PRIVATE to
   a specific START address on either hpux or linux.  First we see
   if mmap with MAP_PRIVATE works.  If it does, we are off to the
   races.  If it doesn't, we try an anonymous private mmap since the
   kernel is more likely to honor the BASE address in anonymous maps.
   We then copy the data to the anonymous private map.  This assumes
   of course that we don't need to change the data in the PCH file
   after it is created.

   This approach obviously causes a performance penalty but there is
   little else we can do given the current PCH implementation.  */
