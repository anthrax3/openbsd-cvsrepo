; FIXME: Get rid of this one.
mlibfuncs
Target Report Mask(LIBFUNC)
For intrinsics library: pass all parameters in registers

mabi=mmixware
Target Report RejectNegative InverseMask(ABI_GNU)
Use register stack for parameters and return value

mabi=gnu
Target Report RejectNegative Mask(ABI_GNU)
Use call-clobbered registers for parameters and return value

; FIXME: Provide a way to *load* the epsilon register.
mepsilon
Target Report Mask(FCMP_EPSILON)
Use epsilon-respecting floating point compare instructions

mzero-extend
Target Report Mask(ZERO_EXTEND)
Use zero-extending memory loads, not sign-extending ones

mknuthdiv
Target Report Mask(KNUTH_DIVISION)
Generate divide results with reminder having the same sign as the divisor (not the dividend)

mtoplevel-symbols
Target Report Mask(TOPLEVEL_SYMBOLS)
Prepend global symbols with \":\" (for use with PREFIX)

mno-set-program-start
Target Report RejectNegative
Do not provide a default start-address 0x100 of the program

melf
Target Report RejectNegative
Link to emit program in ELF format (rather than mmo)

mbranch-predict
Target Report RejectNegative Mask(BRANCH_PREDICT)
Use P-mnemonics for branches statically predicted as taken

mno-branch-predict
Target Report RejectNegative InverseMask(BRANCH_PREDICT)
Don't use P-mnemonics for branches

; We use the term "base address" since that's what Knuth uses.  The base
; address goes in a global register.  When addressing, it's more like
; "base address plus offset", with the offset being 0..255 from the base,
; which itself can be a symbol plus an offset.  The effect is like having
; a constant pool in global registers, code offsetting from those
; registers (automatically causing a request for a suitable constant base
; address register) without having to know the specific register or the
; specific offset.  The setback is that there's a limited number of
; registers, and you'll not find out until link time whether you
; should have compiled with -mno-base-addresses.
mbase-addresses
Target Report RejectNegative Mask(BASE_ADDRESSES)
Use addresses that allocate global registers

mno-base-addresses
Target Report RejectNegative InverseMask(BASE_ADDRESSES)
Do not use addresses that allocate global registers

msingle-exit
Target Report RejectNegative InverseMask(USE_RETURN_INSN)
Generate a single exit point for each function

mno-single-exit
Target Report RejectNegative Mask(USE_RETURN_INSN)
Do not generate a single exit point for each function

mset-program-start=
Target Report RejectNegative Joined
Set start-address of the program

mset-data-start=
Target Report RejectNegative Joined
Set start-address of data
