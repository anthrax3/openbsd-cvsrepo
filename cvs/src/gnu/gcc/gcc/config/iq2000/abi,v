Sizes and alignments
--------------------

	Type		Size (bytes)	Alignment (bytes)

	char		1		1
	short		2		2
	int		4		4
	unsigned	4		4
	long		4		4 
	long long	8		8
	float		4		4
	double		8		8
	pointers	4		4 

* alignment within aggregates (structs and unions) is as above, with
  padding added if needed
* aggregates have alignment equal to that of their most aligned
  member
* aggregates have sizes which are a multiple of their alignment

The IQ2000 Stack
---------------

Space is allocated as needed in the stack frame for the following at compile
time:

* Outgoing parameters beyond the eighth

* All automatic arrays, automatic data aggregates, automatic
  scalars which must be addressable, and automatic scalars for
  which there is no room in registers 

* Compiler-generated temporary values (typically when there are
  too many for the compiler to keep them all in registers) 

Space can be allocated dynamically (at runtime) in the stack frame for the
following:

* Memory allocated using the alloca() function of the C library

Addressable automatic variables on the stack are addressed with positive
offsets relative to %27; dynamically allocated space is addressed with positive
offsets from the pointer returned by alloca().

Parameter Assignment to Registers
---------------------------------

Consider the parameters in a function call as ordered from left (first
parameter) to right.  GR contains the number of the next available
general-purpose register.  STARG is the address of the next available stack
parameter word.

INITIALIZE:
	Set GR=r4 and STARG to point to parameter word 1.

SCAN:
	If there are no more parameters, terminate.
	Otherwise, select one of the following depending on the type
	of the next parameter:

    SIMPLE ARG:

	A SIMPLE ARG is one of the following:

	* One of the simple integer types which will fit into a
	  general-purpose register,
	* A pointer to an object of any type,
	* A struct or union small enough to fit in a register (<= 32 bits)
	* A larger struct or union, which shall be treated as a
	  pointer to the object or to a copy of the object.
	  (See below for when copies are made.)

	If GR > r11, go to STACK.  Otherwise, load the parameter value into
	general-purpose register GR and advance GR to the next general-purpose
	register.  Values shorter than the register size are sign-extended or
	zero-extended depending on whether they are signed or unsigned.  Then
	go to SCAN.

    DOUBLE or LONG LONG

	If GR > r10, go to STACK.  Otherwise, if GR is odd, advance GR to the
	next register.  Load the 64-bit long long or double value into register
	pair GR and GR+1.  Advance GR to GR+2 and go to SCAN.

    STACK:

	Parameters not otherwise handled above are passed in the parameter
	words of the caller's stack frame.  SIMPLE ARGs, as defined above, are
	considered to have size and alignment equal to the size of a
	general-purpose register, with simple argument types shorter than this
	sign- or zero-extended to this width.  Round STARG up to a multiple of
	the alignment requirement of the parameter and copy the argument
	byte-for-byte into STARG, STARG+1, ...  STARG+size-1.  Set STARG to
	STARG+size and go to SCAN.


Structure passing
-----------------

As noted above, code which passes structures and unions by value is implemented
specially.  (In this section, "struct" will refer to structs and unions
inclusively.)  Structs small enough to fit in a register are passed by value in
a single register or in a stack frame slot the size of a register.  Structs
containing a single double or long long component are passed by value in two
registers or in a stack frame slot the size of two registers.  Other structs
are handled by passing the address of the structure.  In this case, a copy of
the structure will be made if necessary in order to preserve the pass-by-value
semantics.

Copies of large structs are made under the following rules:

			ANSI mode			K&R Mode
			---------			--------
Normal param	 	Callee copies if needed		Caller copies
Varargs (...) param	Caller copies			Caller copies

In the case of normal (non-varargs) large-struct parameters in ANSI mode, the
callee is responsible for producing the same effect as if a copy of the
structure were passed, preserving the pass-by-value semantics.  This may be
accomplished by having the callee make a copy, but in some cases the callee may
be able to determine that a copy is not necessary in order to produce the same
results.  In such cases, the callee may choose to avoid making a copy of the
parameter.


Varargs handling
----------------

No special changes are needed for handling varargs parameters other than the
caller knowing that a copy is needed on struct parameters larger than a
register (see above).

The varargs macros set up a register save area for the general-purpose
registers to be saved.  Because the save area lies between the caller and
callee stack frames, the saved register parameters are contiguous with
parameters passed on the stack.  A pointer advances from the register save area
into the caller's stack frame.


Function return values
----------------------

	Type		Register
	----		--------
	int		r2
	short		r2
	long		r2
	long long	r2-r3
	float		r2
	double		r2-r3
	struct/union	see below

Structs/unions which will fit into two general-purpose registers are returned
in r2, or in r2-r3 if necessary.  Larger structs/unions are handled by the
caller passing as a "hidden" first argument a pointer to space allocated to
receive the return value.
