@The Build script will look for the default site configuration files in
this directory.  Build will include the following files if they are
present in this directory:

	site.config.m4
	site.OS.$SENDMAIL_SUFFIX.m4
	site.OS.m4
	site.post.m4

OS is the name of the operating system file selected from the devtools/OS
directory.  SENDMAIL_SUFFIX is a user environment variable which can be
used to further distinguish between site configuration files in this
directory.  If set, it will also be used in generating the obj.* directory
name.

See the README in the devtools directory for more information.
