@Update to sendmail 8.11.4:
    8.11.4 revamps signal handling within the MTA in order to reduce
    the likelihood of a race condition that can lead to heap
    corruption as described in Michal Zalewski's advisory.  The
    problems discussed in the advisory are not currently known to
    be exploitable but we recommend upgrading to 8.11.4 in case a
    method is found to exploit the signal handling race condition.
    8.11.4 also fixes other bugs found since the release of 8.11.3.

See the RELEASE_NOTES file for more details.
