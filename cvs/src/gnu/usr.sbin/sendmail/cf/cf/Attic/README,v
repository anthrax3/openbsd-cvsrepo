	SENDMAIL CONFIGURATION FILES INSTALLATION

This document describes how to install the sendmail configuration files.
Please see ../README about the sendmail configuration files themselves.

By default you need two .mc files: sendmail.mc and submit.mc.  The
latter is an OS independent configuration file for the mail submission
program (MSP).  See ../README for details about both files.

Installation of these two files can be done via:

	make install-cf

If you use a different name than "sendmail" for your main .mc file"
then you should use

	make install-cf CF=config

where "config" is the name of your main .mc file.

The default installation directory is /etc/mail and can be changed
by specifying

	MAILDIR=/other/dir

The name of the source file for "submit.cf" can be overridden by

	SUBMIT=msp

For more details see Makefile.
