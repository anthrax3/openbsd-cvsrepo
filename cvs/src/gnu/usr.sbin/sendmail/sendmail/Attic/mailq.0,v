MAILQ(1)                                                 MAILQ(1)

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       MMaaiillqq  prints  a  summary  of the mail messages queued for
       future delivery.

       The first line printed for each message shows the internal
       identifier  used on this host for the message, the size of
       the message in bytes, the date and time  the  message  was
       accepted  into  the  queue, and the envelope sender of the
       message.  The second line shows  the  error  message  that
       caused  this  message to be retained in the queue; it will
       not be present if the message is being processed  for  the
       first  time.  The following lines show message recipients,
       one per line.

       MMaaiillqq is identical to ``sendmail -bp''.

       The options are as follows:

       --vv     Print verbose information.  This adds the  priority
              of  the  message  and  a single character indicator
              (``+'' or blank) indicating whether a warning  mes-
              sage  has  been  sent on the first line of the mes-
              sage.  Additionally, extra lines may be  intermixed
              with  the  recipients  indicating the ``controlling
              user'' information; this shows  who  will  own  any
              programs  that  are executed on behalf of this mes-
              sage  and  the  name  of  the  alias  this  command
              expanded from, if any.

       The  mmaaiillqq  utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error
       occurs.

       ble status character, the size of the  message  in  bytes,
       the date and time the message was accepted into the queue,
       and the envelope sender of the message.  The  second  line

       characters are either ** to indicate the job is being  pro-
       cessed; XX to indicate that the load is too high to process
       the job; and -- to indicate that the job is  too  young  to
       process.  The following lines show message recipients, one
