log
@Update to sendmail 8.12.1.

A potential security problem has been uncovered in 8.12.0 which might
be exploited locally by malicious users to gain access to the client
mail queue.  However, as long as the MTA accepts local connections,
the possible consequences of this potential local exploit are small.
Notice: some operating systems don't provide a way to completely drop
privileges from a set-group-ID program.  In that case sendmail refuses
to run if unsafe options are given.

@Update to sendmail 8.11.6, from the release notes:

SECURITY: Fix a possible memory access violation when specifying
	out-of-bounds debug parameters.  Problem detected by
	Cade Cairns of SecurityFocus.
Avoid leaking recipient information in unrelated DSNs.  This could
	happen if a connection is aborted, several mails had been
	scheduled for delivery via that connection, and the timeout
	is reached such that several DSNs are sent next.  Problem
	noted by Dileepan Moorkanat of Hewlett-Packard.
Fix a possible segmentation violation when specifying too many
	wildcard operators in a rule.  Problem detected by
	Werner Wiethege.
Avoid a segmentation fault on non-matching Hesiod lookups.  Problem
	noted by Russell McOrmond of flora.ca

log
@Update to sendmail 8.11.4:
    8.11.4 revamps signal handling within the MTA in order to reduce
    the likelihood of a race condition that can lead to heap
    corruption as described in Michal Zalewski's advisory.  The
    problems discussed in the advisory are not currently known to
    be exploitable but we recommend upgrading to 8.11.4 in case a
    method is found to exploit the signal handling race condition.
    8.11.4 also fixes other bugs found since the release of 8.11.3.

See the RELEASE_NOTES file for more details.

@Update to sendmail 8.11.3.  This is a maintenance release which
contains bug fixes for problems found after 8.11.2 was released.
Systems which use buffered file I/O (like OpenBSD) were not properly
fsync()'ing the data (df) file.  Although there is little chance
of data loss, this is an important fix.

log
@Pull in patch from current:
Fix (millert), Errata 001:
Update to sendmail 8.11.4:
    8.11.4 revamps signal handling within the MTA in order to reduce
    the likelihood of a race condition that can lead to heap
    corruption as described in Michal Zalewski's advisory.  The
    problems discussed in the advisory are not currently known to
    be exploitable but we recommend upgrading to 8.11.4 in case a
    method is found to exploit the signal handling race condition.
    8.11.4 also fixes other bugs found since the release of 8.11.3.

See the RELEASE_NOTES file for more details.

1.2.4.1
log
@Pull in patch from current:
Errata(028):
The signal handlers in sendmail contain code that is unsafe in the
context of a signal handler.  This leads to potentially serious race
conditions.  At the moment this is a theoretical attack only and can
only be exploited on the local host (if at all).
Fix(millert):
Update to sendmail 8.11.4:
8.11.4 revamps signal handling within the MTA in order to reduce
the likelihood of a race condition that can lead to heap
corruption as described in Michal Zalewski's advisory.  The
problems discussed in the advisory are not currently known to
be exploitable but we recommend upgrading to 8.11.4 in case a
method is found to exploit the signal handling race condition.
8.11.4 also fixes other bugs found since the release of 8.11.3.
