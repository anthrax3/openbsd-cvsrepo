.\"
.TH MAIL.LOCAL 8 "$Date: 2014/02/07 21:25:00 $"
.SH NAME
mail.local
\- store mail in a mailbox
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B mail.local
.RB [ \-7 "] [" \-b "] [" \-d "] [" \-D
.IR mbdb ]
.RB [ \-l "] [" \-f 
\fIfrom\fR|\fB\-r\fR
.IR from ]
.RB [ \-h
\fIfilename\fR ]
.I "user ..."
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Mail.local
reads the standard input up to an end-of-file and appends it to each
.I user's
.B mail 
file.  The
.I user
must be a valid user name.
.PP
The options are as follows:
.TP 1i
.B \-7
Do not advertise 8BITMIME support in LMTP mode.
.TP 
.B \-b
Return a permanent error instead of a temporary error
if a mailbox exceeds quota.
.TP 
.B \-d
Specify this is a delivery (for backward compatibility).
This option has no effect.
.TP 
.BI \-D " mbdb"
Specify the name of the mailbox database
which is used to look up local recipient names.
This option defaults to "pw", which means use getpwnam().
.TP 
.BI \-f " from"
Specify the sender's name.
.TP
.B \-l
Turn on LMTP mode.
.TP 
.BI \-r " from"
Specify the sender's name (for backward compatibility).
Same as \-f.
.TP
.BI \-h " filename"
Store incoming mail in \fIfilename\fR in the user's home directory instead
of a system mail spool directory.
.PP
The next options are only available if
.B mail.local
has been compiled with -DHASHSPOOL.
.TP
.BI \-H " hashtypehashdepth"
Select hashed mail directories.
Valid hash types are
.B u
for user name and
.B m
for MD5 (requires compilation with -DHASHSPOOLMD5).
Example:
.BI \-H " u2"
selects user name hashing with a hash depth of 2.
Note: there must be no space between the hash type and the depth.
.TP
.BI \-p " path"
Specify an alternate mail spool path.
.TP
.BI \-n
Specify that the domain part of recipient addresses in LMTP mode
should not be stripped.
.PP
Individual mail messages in the mailbox are delimited by an empty
line followed by a line beginning with the string ``From ''.
A line containing the string ``From '', the sender's name and a time stamp
is prepended to each delivered mail message.
A blank line is appended to each message.
A greater-than character (``>'') is prepended to any line in the message
which could be mistaken for a ``From '' delimiter line
(that is,
a line beginning with the five characters
``From '' following a blank line).
.PP
The mail files are exclusively locked with 
flock(2) 
while mail is appended, 
and a
.B user.lock
file also is created while the mailbox is locked 
for compatibility with older MUAs.
.PP
If the ``biff'' service is returned by 
getservbyname(3), 
the biff server is notified of delivered mail.
.PP
The
.B mail.local
utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.IP TZ
Used to set the appropriate time zone on the timestamp.
.SH FILES
.PD 0.2v
.TP 2.2i
/tmp/local.XXXXXX
temporary files
.TP
/var/mail/user
user's default mailbox directory
.TP 
/var/mail/user.lock
lock file for a user's default mailbox
.PD
.SH SEE ALSO
mail(1), 
xsend(1), 
flock(2), 
getservbyname(3), 
comsat(8), 
sendmail(8)
.SH WARNING
.B mail.local
escapes only "^From " lines that follow an empty line.
If all lines starting with "From " should be escaped,
use the 'E' flag for the local mailer in the
sendmail.cf file.
.SH HISTORY
A superset of
.B mail.local
(handling mailbox reading as well as mail delivery)
appeared in 
Version 7 AT&T UNIX 
as the program
.BR mail .

1.2.4.1
log
@Pull in patch from current:
Errata(028):
The signal handlers in sendmail contain code that is unsafe in the
context of a signal handler.  This leads to potentially serious race
conditions.  At the moment this is a theoretical attack only and can
only be exploited on the local host (if at all).
Fix(millert):
Update to sendmail 8.11.4:
8.11.4 revamps signal handling within the MTA in order to reduce
the likelihood of a race condition that can lead to heap
corruption as described in Michal Zalewski's advisory.  The
problems discussed in the advisory are not currently known to
be exploitable but we recommend upgrading to 8.11.4 in case a
method is found to exploit the signal handling race condition.
8.11.4 also fixes other bugs found since the release of 8.11.3.

See the RELEASE_NOTES file for more details.
