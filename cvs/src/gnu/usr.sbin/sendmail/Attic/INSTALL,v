			Installing sendmail

Note: as of sendmail 8.9, a new build architecture is in place that allows
you to use the "Build" shell script in any of the program directories.
On many environments this will do everything for you, no fuss, no muss.

1. Read all the README files noted in the INTRODUCTION section of the README
   file in this top-level directory.

2. Create any necessary site configuration build files, as noted in
   devtools/Site/README.

3. In the sendmail/ directory, run "sh Build" (see sendmail/README for
   details).

4. In the cf/cf/ directory (that's not a typo), copy whichever .mc file
   best matches your environment to config.mc, where config can be any
   name.  Next, tailor it as explained in cf/README.  Then run
   "sh Build config.cf".

5. Back up your current /etc/mail/sendmail.cf and the sendmail binary (whose
   location varies from operating system to operating system, but is usually
   in /usr/sbin or /usr/lib).

6. Install config.cf as /etc/mail/sendmail.cf and install the sendmail binary
   built in step 3 by cd-ing back to sendmail/ and running "sh Build install".

7. For each of the associated sendmail utilities (makemap, mailstats, etc.),
   read the README in the utility's directory.  When you are ready to install
   it, back up your installed version and type "sh Build install".

8. If you are upgrading from an older version of sendmail and are using any
   database maps, be sure to rebuild them with the new version of makemap,
   in case you are now using a different (and thereby incompatible) version
   of Berkeley DB.

**Note**: Starting with sendmail 8.12, sendmail is no longer set-user-ID
root by default.  As a result of this, you need to install two .cf files.
See steps 4 and 6 in this document.  We also strongly recommend reading
sendmail/SECURITY for more installation information.

6. Install sendmail.cf as /etc/mail/sendmail.cf and submit.cf as
   /etc/mail/submit.cf.  This can be done in the cf/cf by using
   "sh Build install-cf".

   Please read sendmail/SECURITY before continuing; you have to create a
   new user smmsp and a new group smmsp for the default installation.
   Then install the sendmail binary built in step 3 by cd-ing back to
   sendmail/ and running "sh Build install".
