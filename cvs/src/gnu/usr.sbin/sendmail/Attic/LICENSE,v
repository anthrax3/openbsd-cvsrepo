@Update to sendmail-8.12.10.  This includes a fix for a buffer overflow
in address parsing.  That fix (but not all of sendmail-8.12.10) has
been applied to OpenBSD 3.4 and the 3.2 and 3.2 -stable branches.

@Update to sendmail 8.11.3.  This is a maintenance release which
contains bug fixes for problems found after 8.11.2 was released.
Systems which use buffered file I/O (like OpenBSD) were not properly
fsync()'ing the data (df) file.  Although there is little chance
of data loss, this is an important fix.

1.2.4.1
log
@Pull in patch from current:
Errata(028):
The signal handlers in sendmail contain code that is unsafe in the
context of a signal handler.  This leads to potentially serious race
conditions.  At the moment there is a theoretical attack only and
can only be exploited on the local host (if at all).
Fix(millert):
Update to sendmail 8.11.4:
8.11.4 revamps signal handling within the MTA in order to reduce
the likelihood of a race condition that can lead to heap
corruption as described in Michal Zalewski's advisory.  The
problems discussed in the advisory are not currently known to
be exploitable but we recommend upgrading to 8.11.4 in case a
method is found to exploit the signal handling race condition.
8.11.4 also fixes other bugs found since the release of 8.11.3.

See the RELEASE_NOTES file for more details.
