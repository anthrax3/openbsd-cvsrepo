@Update to sendmail 8.12.1.

A potential security problem has been uncovered in 8.12.0 which might
be exploited locally by malicious users to gain access to the client
mail queue.  However, as long as the MTA accepts local connections,
the possible consequences of this potential local exploit are small.
Notice: some operating systems don't provide a way to completely drop
privileges from a set-group-ID program.  In that case sendmail refuses
to run if unsafe options are given.
