**  SM_VSPRINTF -- format data for "output" into a string
**
**	Assigned 'str' to a "fake" file pointer. This allows common
**	o/p formatting function sm_vprintf() to be used.
**
**	Parameters:
**		str -- location for output
**		fmt -- format directives
**		ap -- data unit vectors for use by 'fmt'
**
**	Results:
**		result from sm_io_vfprintf()
**
**	Side Effects:
**		Quietly limits the size to INT_MAX though this may
**		not prevent SEGV's.

@Update to sendmail 8.12.1.

A potential security problem has been uncovered in 8.12.0 which might
be exploited locally by malicious users to gain access to the client
mail queue.  However, as long as the MTA accepts local connections,
the possible consequences of this potential local exploit are small.
Notice: some operating systems don't provide a way to completely drop
privileges from a set-group-ID program.  In that case sendmail refuses
to run if unsafe options are given.
