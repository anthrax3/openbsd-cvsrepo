@mkhybrid 1.12b5.1

Note, this normally makes a "mkisofs" which is the same binary, mkisofs
from here needs to be tested out prior to replacing our existing mkisofs
with this. (currently just installs mkhybrid)

libhfs code Copyright (C) 1996, 1997 Robert Leslie

WARNING - this is Beta release code - please use with care!
If you find a bug, please report it to the address given below.

This code is based on a Beta release of mkisofs, so there may be
problems unrelated to my additions. However, I have found mkisofs
v1.12b5 to be very stable.

However, many people are using v1.12, so although it's called a "beta"
release, I would encourage people to use it ...
Most of the HFS features work fine, however, some are not fully tested.
These are marked as "Alpha" in the man page.

Please read the man page (mkhybrid.8, or mkhybrid_man.html) for information
on how to use mkhybrid.

Also see "ChangeLog.mkhybrid" for any minor changes/bug fixes

DESCRIPTION

mkhybrid is a pre-mastering utility that creates ISO9660/ROCKRIDGE/JOLIET/HFS
hybrid CDROM images. You will have to use some other CD-R package to write
the image to a CD.

INSTALLATION

To make/install, type "./configure", make any changes to the Makefile
and type "make"

This has been tested with gcc on SunOS 4.1.3 (see below), gcc on Linux
(Redhat v5.1), cc on IRIX 5.3/6.2 and gcc on Win95/WinNT4 using Cygnus'
cygwin (see README.win32)

If you are using SunOS 4.1.[34], then you need the following patches
to read CDs with associated files:

SunOS 4.1.3:		Patch 101832-05
SunOS 4.1.3_U1:		Patch 101833-02
SunOS 4.1.4:		Patch 102583-02


EXAMPLES

To create a HFS hybrid CD with the Joliet and Rock Ridge extensions or
the source directory cd_dir:

% mkhybrid -o cd.iso -r -J -hfs cd_dir

To create a HFS hybrid CD from the source directory cd_dir that contains
Netatalk Apple/Unix files:

% mkhybrid -o cd.iso --netatalk cd_dir

To create a HFS hybrid CD from the source directory cd_dir, giving all files
CREATOR and TYPES based on just their filename extensions listed in the file 
"mapping".:

% mkhybrid -o cd.iso -no-mac-files -map mapping cd_dir

To create a CD with the 'Apple Extensions to ISO9660', from the source
direcories cd_dir and another_dir. Files in all the known Apple/Unix format
are decoded and any other files are given CREATOR and TYPE based on their
magic number given in the file "magic":

% mkhybird -o cd.iso -magic -apple cd_dir another_dir

The following example puts different files on the CD that all have
the name README, but have different contents when seen as a
ISO9660/RockRidge Joliet or HFS CD.

Current directory contains

% ls -F
README.hfs     README.joliet  README.unix    cd_dir/

The following command puts the contents of the directory "cd_dir" on the
CD along with the three README files - but only one will be seen from
each of the three filesystems:

% mkhybrid -o cd.iso -hfs -J -r \
        -hide README.hfs -hide README.joliet \
        -hide-joliet README.hfs -hide-joliet README.unix \
        -hide-hfs README.joliet -hide-hfs README.unix \
        README=README.hfs README=README.joliet README=README.unix \
        cd_dir

i.e. the file README.hfs will be seen as README on the HFS CD and the
other two README files will be hidden. Similarly for the Joliet and
ISO9660/RockRidge CD.

There are probably all sorts of stange results possible with
combinations of the hide options ...


Any comments, bug reports/fixes to the address below.

Please state the version, platform and command line used when submitting
a bug report - the output from "-log-file -v" would help.
