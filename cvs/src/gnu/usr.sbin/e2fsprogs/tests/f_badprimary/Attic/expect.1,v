@Filesystem did not have a UUID; generating one.

Pass 1: Checking inodes, blocks, and sizes
The primary superblock (1) is on the bad block list.

If the block is really bad, the filesystem can not be fixed.
You can clear the this block from the bad block list
and hope that block is really OK, but there are no guarantees.

Clear (and hope for the best)? yes

Block 2 in the primary group descriptors is on the bad block list

If the block is really bad, the filesystem can not be fixed.
You can clear the this block from the bad block list
