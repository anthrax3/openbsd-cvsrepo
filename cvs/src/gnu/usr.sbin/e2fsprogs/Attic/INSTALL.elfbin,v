@NOTE: This is the ELF version of the binary distribution.  If you have
a DLL system, please compile e2fsprogs from sources yourself.

	To install the binary distribution of the second extended file
system management programs, just follow the steps:

1) Install this tar file using the following command:

	gunzip < e2fsprogs-1.09-elfbin.tar.gz | (cd /; tar Sxvpf - )

2) Run ldconfig to update the shared library pointers.

        As root, type /sbin/ldconfig. This will update the links to
the shared libraries included in the distribution. You can then remove
the old versions of the libraries from /lib.  

3) Remove any pre-formatted man pages.  

	Some distributions will have pre-formatted manual pages which
will always be displayed in preference to newer man pages in /usr/man.
If this is the case, you may need to manually remove them in order to
see the correct manual pages.  The shell script in
install-utils/remove_preformat_manpages may be helpful in doing so.

4) Make sure your /etc/fstab file is correct.

	Some distributions install an /etc/fstab which is missing the
fifth and sixth field of filesystem entry, which are the dump
frequency, and the fsck pass number, respectively.  The problem with
this is that the getmntent() library routine interprets those missing
fields as "0", and a pass number of 0 is documented as meaning that
fsck should not check that particular filesystem.  If your entries in
your /etc/fstab file look liks this:

/dev/hda4       /        ext2        defaults

you should add "1 1" at the end of each line, so that they look like this:

/dev/hda4       /        ext2        defaults	1	1

	There is a script in install-utils/convfstab (donated by
Michael Weller) that may help you correct your /etc/fstab file.

5) Cleanup files from the installation.

	When you're done with the installation, you will probably want
to remove /INSTALL (this file), /README, and /install-utils from your
root directory
