@	To install the second extended file system management programs,
just follow the steps:

1) Change directory into the top of the e2fsprogs source tree

2) Create a build directory and cd into it:

	mkdir build; cd build

3)  Run the configure script

	../configure

	If you wish to turn on DLL shared libraries, add the option
flag --enable-dll-shlibs.  If you wish to turn on ELF shared
libraries, add the option --enable-elf-shlibs.  If you wish to build
profiling libraries, add the option --enable-profile.

4)  Compile the programs

	make

5)   Check to make sure the installation built correctly:

	make check

6)  Install the programs

	Run `make install'

7)  Install the include files and libraries

	You can run `make install-libs' to install the include files and
libraries.  Please note that this installation is not needed for the
programs to work.  It is only needed if you expect to develop other
programs using the libraries or if you want to compile other program
using these libraries (like the 4.4BSD dump and restore port).

8)  Remove any pre-formatted man pages.  

	Some distributions will have pre-formatted manual pages which
will always be displayed in preference to newer man pages in /usr/man.
If this is the case, you may need to manually remove them in order to
see the correct manual pages.  The shell script in
install-utils/remove_preformat_manpages may be helpful in doing so.

9)  Make sure your /etc/fstab file is correct.

	Some distributions install an /etc/fstab which is missing the
fifth and sixth field of filesystem entry, which are the dump
frequency, and the fsck pass number, respectively.  The problem with
this is that the getmntent() library routine interprets those missing
fields as "0", and a pass number of 0 is documented as meaning that
fsck should not check that particular filesystem.  If your entries in
your /etc/fstab file look liks this:

/dev/hda4       /        ext2        defaults

you should add "1 1" at the end of each line, so that they look like this:

/dev/hda4       /        ext2        defaults	1	1

	There is a script in install-utils/convfstab (donated by
Michael Weller) that may help you correct your /etc/fstab file.
