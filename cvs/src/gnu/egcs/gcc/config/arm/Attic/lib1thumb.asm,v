/* These labels & instructions are used by the Arm/Thumb interworking code,
   when the target address is in an unknown instruction set.  The address 
   of function to be called is loaded into a register and then one of these
   labels is called via a BL instruction.  This puts the return address 
   into the link register with the bottom bit set, and the code here 
   switches to the correct mode before executing the function.  Unfortunately
   the target code cannot be relied upon to return via a BX instruction, so
   instead we have to store the resturn address on the stack and allow the
   called function to return here instead.  Upon return we recover the real
   return address and use a BX to get back to Thumb mode.  */
