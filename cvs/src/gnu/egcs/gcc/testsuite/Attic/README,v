@Remove gcc 2.95 from the tree. One of the least bogus compiler we had (although
it had required some generous bandaid), but unfortunately not able to compile
most of the Real World (tm) software.
@
text
@This is a collection of tests for the C and C++ frontends of EGCS. For
further information please check README.gcc and README.g++, though the
latter may not be up-to-date any more.

The driver that runs this testsuite is called DejaGnu and you will
need a current DejaGnu snapshot, which is available from
ftp://egcs.cygnus.com/pub/egcs/infrastructure, for example.

Most of these tests were originally developed and/or collected by
Cygnus Solutions, but these days many are being added by the EGCS
developers.

These tests are included "as is". If any of them fails, do not report
a bug.  Bug reports for DejaGnu can go to bug-dejagnu@@prep.ai.mit.edu.
Discussion and comments about this testsuite should be sent to
egcs@@egcs.cygnus.com; additions and changes to should go to sent to
egcs-patches@@egcs.cygnus.com.

The entire testsuite is invoked by `make check` at the top level of
the EGCS tree. `make check-g++` runs the C++ testsuite only.


STRUCTURE OF THE TESTSUITE

Almost all C++ tests reside in subdirectories of g++.old-deja, based on
the following structure:

  g++.benjamin	Tests by Benjamin Koz
  g++.bob
  g++.brendan	Tests by Brendan Kehoe
  g++.bugs
  g++.eh  	Tests for exception handling
  g++.ext  	Tests for g++ extensions
  g++.gb  	Tests by Gerald Baumgartner
  g++.jason	Tests by Jason Merill
  g++.jeff	Tests by Jeffrey A Law
  g++.martin	Tests by Martin v. Löwis
  g++.mike	Tests by Mike Stump
  g++.niklas	Tests by Niklas Hallqvist
  g++.ns  	Tests for namespaces
  g++.other
  g++.pt  	Tests for templates
  g++.rfg
  g++.robertl	Tests from egcs-bugs@@egcs.cygnus.com, gathered by Robert Lipe
	
g++.old-deja uses a fixed driver for all g++ tests based on the old
DejaGnu drivers. But just because its old, doesn't mean its redundant!
Tests that want to use the normal dg.exp driver can be put in g++.dg instead.
This may be required for platform-specific tests, or tests with other
special requirements.
