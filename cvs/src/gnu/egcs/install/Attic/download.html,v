@Remove gcc 2.95 from the tree. One of the least bogus compiler we had (although
it had required some generous bandaid), but unfortunately not able to compile
most of the Real World (tm) software.

<h1 align="center">Downloading GCC</h1>

<p>GCC is distributed via FTP tarballs compressed with gzip or bzip2.  It is
possible to download a full distribution or specific components.

<p>The full distribution includes the C, C++, Objective-C, Fortran, Java,
and Chill compilers.  The full distribution also includes runtime libraries
for C++, Objective-C and Fortran.  In the future the GNU compiler testsuites
will be included in the full distribution.

<p>If you choose to download specific components, you must download the core
gcc distribution plus any language specific distributions you wish to
use.  The core distribution includes the C language front-end as well as the
shared componenets. Each language has a tarball which includes the language
front-end as well as the language runtime (when appropriate).

<p>Unpack the core distribution as well as any language specific distributions
in the same directory.

<P>If you also intend to build binutils (either to upgrade an existing
installation or for use in place of the corresponding tools of your
OS), unpack the binutils distribution either in the same directory or
a separate one.  In the latter case, add symbolic links to any
components of the binutils you intend to build alongside the compiler
(bfd, binutils, gas, gprof, ld, opcodes,...) to the directory containing
the GCC sources.</p>
