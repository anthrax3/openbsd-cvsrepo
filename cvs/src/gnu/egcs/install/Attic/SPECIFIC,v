  alpha*-dec-linux*
  
   GNU/Linux Alpha EV56 or PCA56 hosts running Red Hat 4.2 or 5.0 may see
   errors of this sort:
  Error: Unknown pseudo-op:  `.arch'

   This is a signal that a new assembler is needed if you want to
   generate BWX insns for your machine.
   
   The version of GCC shipped with Red Hat 4.2 (2.7.0.2) has a fault
   wherein it will silently generate incorrect code. The version shipped
   with Red Hat 5.0 (2.8.0.1) is not broken, but required an extra
   -m21164a argument on the command-line. In order to visibly trap
   2.7.0.2, I now issue DEC's .arch pseudo into the assembly. Relieving
   the problem of mucking with command-line arguments for 2.8.0.1 is a
   pleasant side effect.
   
   If you've got Red Hat 5.0 installed, you may grab binutils 2.9.1 and
   be happy. If you've got Red Hat 4.2, bugs make it much harder to
   upgrade pieces on your own, and you are better off upgrading the
   entire system.
   
   In either case, your problem may be bypassed by not emitting BWX code
   by default. Do this by using
  configure alphaev5-unknown-linux-gnulibc1

   if you have RH 4.2, or
  configure alphaev5-unknown-linux-gnu

   if you have RH 5.0.
   
   The following error:
  Error: macro requires $at register while noat in effect

   also indicates that you should upgrade to a newer version of the
   assembler, 2.9 or later. If you can not upgrade the assembler, the
   compiler option "-Wa,-m21164a" may work around this problem.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
  alpha*-dec-osf*
  
   If you install a shared libstdc++ and, when you link a non-trivial C++
   program (for example, gcc/testsuite/g++.other/delete3.C), the linker
   reports a couple of errors about multiply-defined symbols (for
   example, nothrow, __throw and terminate(void)), you've probably got a
   linker bug, for which there's no known fix. The officially recommended
   work-around is to remove the shared libstdc++.
   
   An alternative solution is to arrange that all symbols from libgcc get
   copied to the shared libstdc++; see detailed solution below.
   (Surprising as it may seem, this does indeed fix the problem!) _Beware_
   that this may bring you binary-compatibility problems in the future,
   if you don't use the same work-around next time you build libstdc++:
   if programs start to depend on libstdc++ to provide symbols that used
   to be only in libgcc, you must arrange that libstdc++ keeps providing
   them, otherwise the programs will have to be relinked.
   
   The magic spell is to add -Wl,-all,-lgcc,-none to the definition of
   macro SHDEPS in libstdc++/config/dec-osf.ml _before_
   alpha*-dec-osf*/libstdc++/Makefile is created (a [19]patch that does
   just that is available). If the Makefile already exists, run
   ./config.status within directory alpha*-dec-osf*/libstdc++ (and
   alpha*-dec-osf*/ieee/libstdc++, if it also exists). Remove any
   existing libstdc++.so* from such directories, and run make
   all-target-libstdc++ in the top-level directory, then make
   install-target-libstdc++.
   
   If you have already removed the build tree, you may just remove
   libstdc++.so.2.10.0 from the install tree and re-create it with the
   command gcc -shared -o libstdc++.so.2.10.0
   -Wl,-all,-lstdc++,-lgcc,-none -lm. If the ieee sub-directory exists,
   repeat this command in it, with the additional flag -mieee.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
  hppa*-hp-hpux*
  
   We _highly_ recommend using gas/binutils-2.8 or newer on all hppa
   platforms; you may encounter a variety of problems when using the HP
   assembler.
   
   If you wish to use pa-risc 2.0 architecture support, you must use
   either the HP assembler or a recent [20]snapshot of gas.
   
   More specific information to hppa*-hp-hpux* targets follows.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
  hppa*-hp-hpux9
  
   The HP assembler has major problems on this platform. We've tried to
   work around the worst of the problems. However, those workarounds may
   be causing linker crashes in some circumstances; the workarounds also
   probably prevent shared libraries from working. Use the GNU assembler
   to avoid these problems.
   
   The configuration scripts for GCC will also trigger a bug in the hpux9
   shell. To avoid this problem set CONFIG_SHELL to /bin/ksh and SHELL to
   /bin/ksh in your environment.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
  hppa*-hp-hpux10
  
   For hpux10.20, we _highly_ recommend you pick up the latest sed patch
   PHCO_15468 from HP. HP has two sites which provide patches free of
   charge:
     * [21]US, Canada, Asia-Pacific, and Latin-America
     * [22]Europe
       
   The HP assembler on these systems is much better than the hpux9
   assembler, but still has some problems. Most notably the assembler
   inserts timestamps into each object file it creates, causing the
   3-stage comparison test to fail during a `make bootstrap'. You should
   be able to continue by saying `make all' after getting the failure
   from `make bootstrap'.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
  i?86-*-linux*
  
   You will need binutils-2.9.1.0.15 or newer for exception handling to
   work.
   
   If you receive Signal 11 errors when building on GNU/Linux, then it is
   possible you have a hardware problem. Further information on this can
   be found on [23]www.bitwizard.nl.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
  i?86-*-sco3.2v5*
  
   If you are building languages other than C, you must follow the
   instructions about invoking `make bootstrap' because the native
   OpenServer compiler will build a cc1plus that will not correctly parse
   many valid C++ programs including those in libgcc.a. _You must do a
   `make bootstrap' if you are building with the native compiler._
   
   Use of the `-march-pentiumpro' flag can result in unrecognized opcodes
   when using the native assembler. While it's rather rare to see these
   emitted by GCC yet, errors of the basic form:
  /usr/tmp/ccaNlqBc.s:22:unknown instruction: fcomip
  /usr/tmp/ccaNlqBc.s:50:unknown instruction: fucomip

   are symptoms of this problem. You may work around this by not building
   affected files with that flag or by using the GNU assembler. Users of
   GNU assembler should see the note below for hazards on doing so.
   
   If you choose to configure with --enable-shared you should also
   specificy --with-gnu-as --disable-multilib even if you are not using
   the GNU assembler. In doing so you will give up the ability to
   generate COFF executables as described below. This combination of
   flags is necessary to suppress negative interactions with multilibing.
   
   The native SCO assembler that is provided with the OS at no charge is
   normally required. If, however, you must be able to use the GNU
   assembler you may configure this package using the flags
   --with-gnu-as. You must use a recent version of GNU binutils; version
   2.9.1 seems to work well. If you select this option, you will be
   unable to reliably build COFF images. In general, the --with-gnu-as
   option isn't as well tested as the native assembler.
   
   Unlike various prereleases of GCC that used -belf and defaulted to
   COFF, you must now use the -melf and -mcoff flags to toggle between
   the two object file formats. ELF is now the default.
   
   Look in gcc/config/i386/sco5.h (search for "messy") for additional
   OpenServer-specific flags.
   
   Systems based on OpenServer before 5.0.4 (`uname -X' will tell you
   what you're running) require TLS597 from ftp.sco.com/TLS for C++
   constructors and destructors to work right.
   
   The system linker in (at least) 5.0.4 and 5.0.5 will sometimes do the
   wrong thing for a construct that GCC will emit for PIC code. This can
   be seen as execution testsuite failures when using -fPIC on
   921215-1.c, 931002-1.c, nestfunc-1.c, and gcov-1.c. For 5.0.5, an
   updated linker that will cure this problem is available. You must
   install both [24]ftp://ftp.sco.com/Supplements/rs505a/ and
   [25]OSS499A.
   
   The dynamic linker in OpenServer 5.0.5 (earlier versions may show the
   same problem) aborts on certain g77-compiled programs. It's
   particluarly likely to be triggered by building Fortran code with the
   -fPIC flag. Although it's conceivable that the error could be
   triggered by other code, only G77-compiled code has been observed to
   cause this abort. If you are getting core dumps immediately upon
   execution of your g77 program - and especially if it's compiled with
   -fPIC - try applying [26]`sco_osr5_g77.patch' to your libf2c and
   rebuilding GCC. Affected faults, when analyzed in a debugger, will
   show a stack backtrace with a fault occurring in rtld() and the
   program running as /usr/lib/ld.so.1. This problem has been reported to
   SCO engineering and will hopefully be addressed in later releases.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
  i?86-*-udk
  
   This target emulates the SCO Universal Development Kit and requires
   that package be installed. (If it is installed, you will have a
   /udk/usr/ccs/bin/cc file present.) It's very much like the
   i?86-*-unixware7* target but is meant to be used when hosting on a
   system where UDK isn't the default compiler such as OpenServer 5 or
   Unixware 2. This target will generate binaries that will run on
   OpenServer, Unixware 2, or Unixware 7, with the same warnings and
   caveats as the SCO UDK.
   
   You can stage1 with either your native compiler or with UDK. If you
   don't do a full bootstrap when initially building with your native
   compiler you will have an utterly unusable pile of bits as your
   reward.
   
   This target is a little tricky to build because we have to distinguish
   it from the native tools (so it gets headers, startups, and libraries
   from the right place) while making the tools not think we're actually
   building a cross compiler. The easiest way to do this is with a
   configure command like this:
  CC=/udk/usr/ccs/bin/cc _/your/path/to/_gcc/configure --host=i686-pc-udk --tar
get=i686-pc-udk --exec-prefix=udk-

   _You should substitute 'i686' in the above command with the
   appropriate processor for your host._
   
   You should follow this with a `make bootstrap' then `make install'.
   You can then access the UDK-targeted GCC tools by adding udk- before
   the commonly known name. For example, to invoke the C compiler, you
   would use `udk-gcc'. They will coexist peacefully with any
   native-target GCC tools you may have installed.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
  *-ibm-aix*
  
   AIX Make frequently has problems with GCC makefiles. GNU Make 3.76 or
   newer is recommended to build on this platform.
   
   Some versions of the AIX binder (linker) can fail with a relocation
   overflow severe error when the -bbigtoc option is used to link
   GCC-produced object files into an executable that overflows the TOC. A
   fix for APAR IX75823 (OVERFLOW DURING LINK WHEN USING GCC AND
   -BBIGTOC) is available from IBM Customer Support and from its
   [27]service.boulder.ibm.com website as PTF U455193.
   
   Binutils does not support AIX 4.3 (at least through release 2.9). GNU
   as and GNU ld will not work properly and one should not configure GCC
   to use those GNU utilities. Use the native AIX tools which do
   interoperate with GCC.
   
   AIX 4.3 utilizes a new "large format" archive to support both 32-bit
   and 64-bit object modules. The routines provided in AIX 4.3.0 and AIX
   4.3.1 to parse archive libraries did not handle the new format
   correctly. These routines are used by GCC and result in error messages
   during linking such as "not a COFF file". The version of the routines
   shipped with AIX 4.3.1 should work for a 32-bit environment. The -g
   option of the archive command may be used to create archives of 32-bit
   objects using the original "small format". A correct version of the
   routines is shipped with AIX 4.3.2.
   
   The initial assembler shipped with AIX 4.3.0 generates incorrect
   object files. A fix for APAR IX74254 (64BIT DISASSEMBLED OUPUT FROM
   COMPILER FAILS TO ASSEMBLE/BIND) is available from IBM Customer
   Support and from its [28]service.boulder.ibm.com website as PTF
   U453956. This fix is incorporated in AIX 4.3.1 and above.
   
   The AIX 4.3.2.1 linker (bos.rte.bind_cmds Level 4.3.2.1) will dump
   core with a segmentation fault when invoked by any version of GCC. A
   fix for APAR IX87327 will be available from IBM Customer Support.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
  m68k-*-nextstep*
  
   You absolutely _must_ use GNU sed and GNU make on this platform.
   
   On NEXTSTEP 3.x where x < 3 the build of GCC will abort during stage1
   with an error message like this:
  _eh
  /usr/tmp/ccbbsZ0U.s:987:Unknown pseudo-op: .section
  /usr/tmp/ccbbsZ0U.s:987:Rest of line ignored. 1st junk character
  valued 95 (_).

   The reason for this is the fact that NeXT's assembler for these
   versions of the operating system does not support the .section pseudo
   op that's needed for full C++ exception functionality.
   
   As NeXT's assembler is a derived work from GNU as, a free replacement
   that does can be obtained at
   [29]ftp://ftp.next.peak.org:/next-ftp/next/apps/devtools/as.3.3.NIHS.s
   .tar.gz.
   
   If you try to build the integrated C++ & C++ runtime libraries on this
   system you will run into trouble with include files. The way to get
   around this is to use the following sequence. Note you must have write
   permission to the directory _prefix_ you secified in the configuration
   preocess of GCC for this sequence to work.
  cd bld-gcc
  make all-texinfo all-bison all-byacc all-binutils all-gas all-ld
  cd gcc
  make bootstrap
  make install-headers-tar
  cd ..
  make bootstrap3
     _________________________________________________________________
   
  m68k-sun-sunos4.1.1
  
   It is reported that you may need the GNU assembler on this platform.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
  mips*-sgi-irix[45]
  
   You must use GAS on these platforms, as the native assembler can not
   handle the code for exception handling support. Either of these
   messages indicates that you are using the MIPS assembler when instead
   you should be using GAS:
  as0: Error: ./libgcc2.c, line 1:Badly delimited numeric literal
  .4byte $LECIE1-$LSCIE1
  as0: Error: ./libgcc2.c, line 1:malformed statement

   or:
  as0: Error: /src/bld-gcc/gcc/libgcc2.c, line 1:undefined symbol in expression
  .word $LECIE1-$LSCIE1

   These systems don't have ranlib, which various components in GCC need;
   you should be able to avoid this problem by installing GNU binutils,
   which includes a functional ranlib for this system.
   
   You may get the following warning on irix4 platforms, it can be safely
   ignored.
  warning: foo.o does not have gp tables for all its sections.

   When building GCC, the build process loops rebuilding cc1 over and
   over again. This happens on mips-sgi-irix5.2, and possibly other
   platforms.
   It has been reported that this is a known bug in the make shipped with
   IRIX 5.2. We recommend you use GNU make instead of the vendor supplied
   make program; however, you may have success with "smake" on IRIX 5.2
   if you do not have GNU make available.
   
   See [30]http://reality.sgi.com/ariel/freeware for more information
   about using GCC on IRIX platforms.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
  mips*-sgi-irix6
  
   You must _not_ use GAS on irix6 platforms; doing so will only cause
   problems.
   
   These systems don't have ranlib, which various components in GCC need;
   you should be able to avoid this problem by making a dummy script
   called ranlib which just exits with zero status and placing it in your
   path.
   
   GCC does not currently support generating O32 ABI binaries in the
   mips-sgi-irix6 configurations. It used to be possible to create a GCC
   with O32 ABI only support by configuring it for the mips-sgi-irix5
   target. See the link below for details.
   
   GCC does not correctly pass/return structures which are smaller than
   16 bytes and which are not 8 bytes. The problem is very involved and
   difficult to fix. It affects a number of other targets also, but IRIX
   6 is affected the most, because it is a 64 bit target, and 4 byte
   structures are common. The exact problem is that structures are being
   padded at the wrong end, e.g. a 4 byte structure is loaded into the
   lower 4 bytes of the register when it should be loaded into the upper
   4 bytes of the register.
   
   GCC is consistent with itself, but not consistent with the SGI C
   compiler [and the SGI supplied runtime libraries], so the only
   failures that can happen are when there are library functions that
   take/return such structures. There are very few such library
   functions. I can only recall seeing two of them: inet_ntoa, and
   semctl.
   
   See [31]http://reality.sgi.com/ariel/freeware for more information
   about using GCC on IRIX platforms.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
  powerpc-*-linux-gnu*
  
   You will need [32]binutils-2.9.4.0.8 or newer for a working GCC. It is
   strongly recommended to recompile binutils if you initially built it
   with gcc-2.7.2.x.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
  sparc-sun-solaris2.7
  
   Sun patch 107058-01 (1999-01-13) for SPARC Solaris 7 triggers a bug in
   the dynamic linker. This problem (Sun bug 4210064) affects GCC 2.8 and
   later, including all EGCS releases. To avoid this problem, do not
   install Sun patch 107058-01 until after Sun releases a patch for bug
   4210064. Sun has a fix for this bug but (as of 1999-06-24) has not yet
   released it as a patch.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
  sparc-sun-sunos*
  
   A bug in the SunOS4 linker will cause it to crash when linking -fPIC
   compiled objects (and will therefore not allow you to build shared
   libraries).
   
   To fix this problem you can either use the most recent version of
   binutils or get the latest SunOS4 linker patch (patch ID 100170-10)
   from Sun's patch site.

  sparc-unknown-linux-gnulibc1
  
   It has been reported that you might need [33]binutils-2.8.1.0.23 for
   this platform, too.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
  sparc64-*-*
  
   GCC version 2.95 is not able to compile code correctly for sparc64
   targets. Users of the Linux kernel, at least, can use the sparc32
   program to start up a new shell invocation with an environment that
   causes configure to recognize (via uname -a) the system as sparc-*-*
   instead.
   
   _all ELF targets (SVR4, Solaris, etc.)_
   C++ support is significantly better on ELF targets if you use the GNU
   linker; duplicate copies of inlines, vtables and template
   instantiations will be discarded automatically.

  GCC with Windows or OS/2
  
   GCC does not currently support Windows, either natively or with the
   cygwin32 dll. However Mumit Khan has been working on supporting
   Windows with GCC. You should check out his site if you're interested
   in Windows support. [34]GNU Win32 related projects
   
   GCC does not currently support OS/2. However, Andrew Zabolotny has
   been working on a generic os/2 port with pgcc. The current code code
   can be found at [35]http://www.goof.com/pcg/os2/.

   Errors involving "alloca" when building GCC generally are due to an
   incorrect definition of CC in the Makefile or mixing files compiled
   with the native C compiler and GCC. During the stage1 phase of the
   build, the native AIX compiler _must_ be invoked as "cc" (not "xlc").
   Once configure has been informed of "xlc", one needs to use "make
   distclean" to remove the configure cache files and ensure that $CC
   environment variable does not provide a definition that will confuse
   configure. If this error occurs during stage2 or later, then the
   problem most likely is the version of Make (see above).

   You will need [39]binutils-2.9.4.0.8 or newer for a working GCC. It is

  *-*-solaris*
  
   Starting with Solaris, Sun does not ship a C compiler any more. To
   bootstrap and install GCC you first have to install a pre-built
   compiler, for example from [40]http://www.sunfreeware.com.
   
   Sun as 4.X is broken in that it cannot cope with long symbol names. A
   typical error message might look similiar to the following:
   
     /usr/ccs/bin/as: "/var/tmp/ccMsw135.s", line 11041: error: can't
     compute value of an expression involving an external symbol.
     
   See the [41]How to work around too long C++ symbol names? FAQ entry
   for further information.
   
   Sun make in all known Solaris 1 (SunOS 4) and Solaris 2 releases has a
   broken _VPATH_ mechanism, which means you must either:
     * Use GNU make (recommended), _or:_
     * Always build in the source directory, _or:_
     * _(For GCC 2.95.1 only)_ apply the patches mentioned at
       [42]http://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/egcstensions.html#sun-make.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
  sparc-sun-solaris*
  
   binutils 2.9.1 has known bugs on this platform. We recommend to use
   the vendor tools (Sun as, Sun ld) until these have been fixed.
     _________________________________________________________________

   later, including all EGCS releases. Sun formerly recommended 107058-01
   for all Solaris 7 users, but around 1999-09-01 it started to recommend
   it only for people who use Sun's compilers.
   
   Here are some workarounds to this problem:
     * Do not install Sun patch 107058-01 until after Sun releases a
       complete patch for bug 4210064. This is the simplest course to
       take, unless you must also use Sun's C compiler. Unfortunately
       107058-01 is preinstalled on some new Solaris-based hosts, so you
       may have to back it out.
     * Copy the original, unpatched Solaris 7 /usr/ccs/bin/as into
       /usr/local/lib/gcc-lib/sparc-sun-solaris2.7/2.95.1/as, adjusting
       the latter name to fit your local conventions and software version
       numbers.
     * Install Sun patch 106950-03 (1999-05-25) or later. Nobody with
       both 107058-01 and 106950-03 installed has reported the bug with
       GCC and Sun's dynamic linker. This last course of action is
       riskiest, for two reasons. First, you must install 106950 on all
       hosts that run code generated by GCC; it doesn't suffice to
       install it only on the hosts that run GCC itself. Second, Sun says
       that 106950-03 is only a partial fix for bug 4210064, but Sun
       doesn't know whether the partial fix is adequate for GCC. Revision
       -08 or later should fix the bug, but (as of 1999-10-06) it is
       still being tested.

  Sun V5.0 Compiler Bugs
  
   The Sun V5.0 compilers are known to mis-compile GCC, which in turn
   causes GCC to fail its bootstrap comparison test. We expect to have a
   workaround ready in time for GCC 2.95.2.

   assembler.

   Specifically, -g does not work on HP-UX (since that system uses a
   peculiar debugging format which GCC does not know about), unless you
   use GAS and GDB and configure GCC with the --with-gnu-as option.

   If you wish to use pa-risc 2.0 architecture support, you must use

   GCC 2.95.2, when configured to use the GNU assembler, would invoke it
   with the -s switch, that GNU as up to 2.9.5.0.12 does not support. If
   you'd rather not use a newer GNU as nor the native assembler, you'll
   need the patch [39]`x86-sol2-gas.patch'.

   If you are using Irix cc as your bootstrap compiler, you must ensure
   that the N32 ABI is in use. To test this, compile a simple C file with
   cc and then run file on the resulting object file. The output should
   look like:

     test.o: ELF N32 MSB ...

   If you see:

     test.o: ELF 32-bit MSB

   then your version of cc uses the O32 ABI default. You should set the
   environment variable CC to 'cc -n32' before configuring GCC.

   Unfortunately, C++ shared libraries, including libstdc++, won't work
   properly if assembled with Sun as: the linker will complain about
   relocations in read-only sections, in the definition of virtual
   tables. Some possible work-arounds: use some development release of
   binutils, wait for the next stable binutils release or refrain from
   creating C++ shared libraries.

   The Sun V5.0 compilers are known to mis-compile GCC 2.95 and GCC
   2.95.1, which in turn causes GCC to fail its bootstrap comparison
   test. GCC 2.95.2 has a workaround.

   Unlike earlier versions of GCC, the ability to generate COFF with this
   target is no longer provided.

   Earlier versions of GCC emitted Dwarf-1 when generating ELF to allow
   the system debugger to be used. That support was too burdensome to
   maintain. GCC now emits only dwarf-2 for this target. This means you
   may use either the UDK debugger or GDB to debug programs built by this
   version of GCC.

   when using the native assembler on OS versions before 5.0.6. (Support
   for P6 opcodes was added to the native ELF assembler in that version.)
   While it's rather rare to see these emitted by GCC yet, errors of the
   basic form:

   affected files with that flag, by using the GNU assembler, or by using
   the assembler provided with the current version of the OS. Users of

   seem to work well. In general, the --with-gnu-as option isn't as well
   tested as the native assembler.
