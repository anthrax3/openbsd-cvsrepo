@Remove gcc 2.95 from the tree. One of the least bogus compiler we had (although
it had required some generous bandaid), but unfortunately not able to compile
most of the Real World (tm) software.

                              Downloading GCC
                                      
   GCC is distributed via FTP tarballs compressed with gzip or bzip2. It
   is possible to download a full distribution or specific components.
   
   The full distribution includes the C, C++, Objective-C, Fortran, Java,
   and Chill compilers. The full distribution also includes runtime
   libraries for C++, Objective-C and Fortran. In the future the GNU
   compiler testsuites will be included in the full distribution.
   
   If you choose to download specific components, you must download the
   core gcc distribution plus any language specific distributions you
   wish to use. The core distribution includes the C language front-end
   as well as the shared componenets. Each language has a tarball which
   includes the language front-end as well as the language runtime (when
   appropriate).
   
   Unpack the core distribution as well as any language specific
   distributions in the same directory.
   
   XXX FSF mirror sites
   
   [1]FTP download from egcs.cygnus.com (USA California)
   
   [2]FTP download from go.cygnus.com (USA California -- High speed link
   provided by Stanford)
   
   GCC releases are available on many [3]FTP mirror sites. If possible,
   please use one of these.

   GCC is distributed via CVS and FTP tarballs compressed with gzip or
   bzip2. It is possible to download a full distribution or specific
   components.

   Please refer to our [1]releases web page for information on how to
   obtain GCC.

   If you also intend to build binutils (either to upgrade an existing
   installation or for use in place of the corresponding tools of your
   OS), unpack the binutils distribution either in the same directory or
   a separate one. In the latter case, add symbolic links to any
   components of the binutils you intend to build alongside the compiler
   (bfd, binutils, gas, gprof, ld, opcodes,...) to the directory
   containing the GCC sources.
