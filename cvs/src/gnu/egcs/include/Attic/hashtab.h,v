/* This package implements basic hash table functionality.  It is possible
   to search for an entry, create an entry and destroy an entry.

   Elements in the table are generic pointers.

   The size of the table is not fixed; if the occupancy of the table
   grows too high the hash table will be expanded.

   The abstract data implementation is based on generalized Algorithm D
   from Knuth's book "The art of computer programming".  Hash table is
   expanded by creation of new hash table and transferring elements from
   the old table to the new table.  */

@Grab hashtab.c from the development version of gcc, add it to libiberty.

Make sure that g++ and g77 link against libiberty (fixed in dev. sources
as well).

Use hashtab functions instead of splay-trees in cse.c.

This is worth a 10% compiling speed increase on some arches, including
sparc, hppa...
