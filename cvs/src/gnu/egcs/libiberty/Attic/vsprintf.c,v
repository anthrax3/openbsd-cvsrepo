@/* Simple implementation of vsprintf for systems without it.
   Highly system-dependent, but should work on most "traditional"
   implementations of stdio; newer ones should already have vsprintf.
   Written by Per Bothner of Cygnus Support.
   Based on libg++'s "form" (written by Doug Lea; dl@@rocky.oswego.edu).
