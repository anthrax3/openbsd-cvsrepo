1.9
log
@Crank all library major numbers.  Needed due to the fact that we
now build libraries with propolice enabled.  Without this, existing
binaries (such as ports/packages) that link with any system library
other than libc will fail with an undefined symbol of "___guard"
(__guard on ELF).

@Partial synch with binutils-2.10
- Update all libiberty files apart from the C++ demangler and hashtab.c
(taken from gcc 2.96, interface changed, would need to keep synch'ed with
gcc)
- bump version.

@My goof... adding functions to libiberty means this is a major bump.
(Fortunately, no other library depends on those new functions)

1.4
log
@Grab hashtab.c from the development version of gcc, add it to libiberty.

Make sure that g++ and g77 link against libiberty (fixed in dev. sources
as well).

Use hashtab functions instead of splay-trees in cse.c.

This is worth a 10% compiling speed increase on some arches, including
sparc, hppa...
