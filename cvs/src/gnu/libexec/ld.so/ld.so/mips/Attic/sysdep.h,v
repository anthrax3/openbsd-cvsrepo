@Fixes to avoid using asm to get pointer to start sp in ld.so. It's a little
hackish but doesn't add any machdep stuff to MI code.
Also don't strip when installing ld.so.

@OK, this is the dynamic loader for the MIPS. It's a hack, it's GPL'd, its
just ugly, but it works. So we stick with it right now...
