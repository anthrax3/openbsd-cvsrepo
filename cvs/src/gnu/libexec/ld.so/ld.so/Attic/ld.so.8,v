@.TH ld.so 8 "October 4 1996"
.SH NAME
ld.so \- ELF dynamic linker/loader
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B ld.so
completes the final process of linking all necessary references to 
sharable objects and unreferenced symbols in an impure executable,
(usually a 
.I dynamically
.I linked
.IR executable ),
to produce a runnable file.
.PP
Unless explicitly specified via the
.B \-static
option to
.B ld
during compilation, all OpenBSD binaries in ELF format will be "incomplete"
and require further linking at run time.
.BR ld.so 's
job is thus to complete the linking process started at compilation.
.PP
The necessary dynamically linked libraries (DLL's) which the executable
requires to complete it's linking process are searched for in the following
order
.IP o
Using the environment variable
.BR LD_ELF_LIBRARY_PATH .
Except if the executable is a setuid/setgid binary, in which case it
is ignored.
.IP o
Using the environment variable
.BR LD_LIBRARY_PATH .
Except if
.B LD_ELF_LIBRARY_PATH
is specified or the executable is a setuid/setgid binary, in which case
it is ignored.
.IP o
From the cache file
.BR /etc/ld.so.cache
which contains a compiled list of candidate libraries previously found
in the augmented library path.
.IP o
In the default path
.BR /usr/lib . 
.SH MESSAGES
The following, possibly fatal, warnings may be output by
.B ld.so
.TP
.SB can't find library 'libfoo'
If
.B ld.so
cannot find the library the executable requires anywhere.
.TP
.SB can't load library 'libfoo'
If the library is corrupt.
.TP
.SB incompatible library 'libfoo'
.PD 0
.TP
.SB Require major version x and found y
.PD
.B ld.so
cannot use the library version found as it is incompatible with the
binary attempting to be executed.
.TP
.SB using incompatible library 'libfoo'
.PD 0
.TP
.SB too many directories in library path
There is a hard coded limit of 32 search directories. The above warning will
ensue it this limit is exceeded.
.TP
.SB dynamic linker error in fixup pass 1,2
.PD 0
.TP
.SB dynamic linker error in resolve pass
.TP
.SB dynamic linker error in reset pass
.PD
An attempt to perform necessary fixups and or relocations failed. These are
usually fatal and signifies possible binary corruption.
.TP
.SB can't map cache file '/etc/ld.so.cache'
.PD 0
.TP
.SB cache file '/etc/ld.so.cache' is corrupt
.TP
.SB cache file '/etc/ld.so.cache' has wrong version
.TP
.SB cache file '/etc/ld.so.cache' is empty
.PD
A problem was encountered with the cache.
Execution will continue as if the cache did not exist.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
.B LD_ELF_LIBRARY_PATH
A colon-separated list of directories in which to search for
libraries at execution-time.
Similar to the 
.B PATH
environment variable.
.TP
.B LD_LIBRARY_PATH
A colon-separated list of directories in which to search for
libraries at execution-time if
.B LD_ELF_LIBRARY_PATH
is not specified.
Similar to the 
.B PATH
environment variable.
.TP
.B LD_ELF_PRELOAD
The name of an additional, user-specified, shared library to be loaded 
after all others.
This can be used to selectively override functions in other shared libraries.
.B LD_PRELOAD
The name of an additional, user-specified, shared library to be loaded 
after all others if
.B LD_ELF_PRELOAD
is not specified.
This can be used to selectively override functions in other shared libraries.
.SH FILES
.PD 0
.TP 20
.B /usr/libexec/ld.so
execution time linker/loader
.TP
.B /etc/ld.so.cache
File containing a compiled list of directories in which to search for
libraries and an ordered list of candidate libraries.
.TP
.B lib*.so.version
shared libraries
.PD
.SH SEE ALSO
.BR ldd (1),
.BR ldconfig (8).
.SH BUGS
.LP
Currently
.B ld.so
has no means of unloading and searching for compatible or newer version of
libraries.
.PP
.SH BUGS
.B ld.so
is 'broken' in several aspects and will be replaced in the future.
.PP
.SH AUTHORS
David Engel, Eric Youngdale, Peter MacDonald, Hongjiu Lu, Linus
Torvalds, Lars Wirzenius and Mitch D'Souza (not necessarily in that order).

@OK, this is the dynamic loader for the MIPS. It's a hack, it's GPL'd, its
just ugly, but it works. So we stick with it right now...
