@# This is an example of call, the call out password file for Taylor
# UUCP.  To use it, you must compile the package with
# HAVE_TAYLOR_CONFIG set to 1 in policy.h (that is the default), copy
# this file to newconfigdir as set in Makefile.in (the default is
# /usr/local/conf/uucp), and edit it as appropriate for your system.

# Everything after a '#' character is a comment.  To uncomment any of
# the sample lines below, just delete the '#'.

# This file is used when the ``call-login'' or ``call-password''
# commands are used in the sys file with a "*" argument (e.g.,
# ``call-login *'').  The system name is looked up in this file, and
# the login name and password are used.

# The point of this is that the sys file may then be publically
# readable, while still concealing the login names and passwords used
# to connect to the remote system.

# The format is just system-name login-name password.
