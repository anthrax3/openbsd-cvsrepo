@# This is an example of port, the port configuration file for Taylor
# UUCP.  To use it, you must compile the package with
# HAVE_TAYLOR_CONFIG set to 1 in policy.h (that is the default), copy
# this file to newconfigdir as set in Makefile.in (the default is
# /usr/local/conf/uucp), and edit it as appropriate for your system.

# Everything after a '#' character is a comment.  To uncomment any of
# the sample lines below, just delete the '#'.

# All ports named in the sys file must be described in a port file.
# It is also possible to describe the port directly in the sys file.

# Commands that appears before the first ``port'' command are defaults
# for all ports that appear later in the file.  In this case all ports
# will default to being modems (other possible types are direct, tcp
# and tli).
#type modem

# Now we describe two ports.

# This is the name of the port.  This name may be used in the sys file
# to select the port, or the sys file may just specify a baud rate in
# which case the first matching unlocked port will be used.
#port port1

# This is the device name to open to dial out.
#device /dev/ttyd0

# This is the dialer to use, as described in the dialer file.
#dialer hayes

# This is the baud rate to dial out at.
#speed 2400

# Here is a second port.  This is like the first, except that it uses
# a different device.  It also permits a range of speeds, which is
# mainly useful if the system specifies a particular baud rate.
#port port2
#device /dev/ttyd1
#dialer hayes
#speed-range 2400 9600
