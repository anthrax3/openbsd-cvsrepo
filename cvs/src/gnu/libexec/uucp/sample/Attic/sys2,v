@# This is an example of a sys file, the file(s) which describe remote
# systems for Taylor UUCP.  To use it, you must compile the package
# with HAVE_TAYLOR_CONFIG set to 1 in policy.h (that is the default),
# copy this file to newconfigdir as set in Makefile.in (the default is
# /usr/local/conf/uucp), and edit it as appropriate for your system.

# If you do not use the ``unknown'' command in the config file, then
# each system that you communicate with must be listed in a sys file.

# Everything after a '#' character is a comment.  To uncomment any of
# the sample lines below, just delete the '#'.

# This is a sample sys file that might be used by a system that
# contacts a couple of other systems, both of which are treated the
# same.  sys1 provides another example.

# Commands that appear before the first ``system'' commands are
# defaults for all systems listed in the file.

# Get the login name and password to use from the call-out file.  By
# default this is the file "call" in newconfigdir.
call-login *
call-password *

# The systems must use a particular login
called-login Ulocal

# Permit local users to send any world readable file
local-send /

# Permit local uses to request into any world writable directory
local-receive /

# Call at any time
time any

# Use port1, then port2
port port1

alternate

port port2

# Now define the systems themselves.  Because of all the defaults we
# used, there is very little to specify for the systems themselves.
