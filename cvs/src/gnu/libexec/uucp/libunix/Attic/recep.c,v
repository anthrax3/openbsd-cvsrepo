/* These routines are used to see whether we have already received a
   file in a previous UUCP connection.  It is possible for the
   acknowledgement of a received file to be lost.  The sending system
   will then not know that the file was correctly received, and will
   send it again.  This can be a problem particularly with protocols
   which support channels, since they may send several small files in
   a single window, all of which may be received correctly although
   the sending system never sees the acknowledgement.  If these files
   involve an execution, the execution will happen twice, which will
   be bad.

   We use a simple system.  For each file we want to remember, we
   create an empty file names .Received/SYS/TEMP, where SYS is the
   name of the system and TEMP is the name of the temporary file used
   by the sender.  If no temporary file is used by the sender, we
   don't remember that we received the file.  This is not perfect, but
   execution files will always have a temporary file, so the most
   important case is handled.  Also, any file received from Taylor
   UUCP 1.04 or greater will always have a temporary file.  */
