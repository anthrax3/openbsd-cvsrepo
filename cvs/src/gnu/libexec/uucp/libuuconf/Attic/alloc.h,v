/* This header file is private to the uuconf memory allocation
   routines, and should not be included by any other files.  */

/* We want to be able to keep track of allocated memory blocks, so
   that we can free them up later.  This will let us free up all the
   memory allocated to hold information for a system, for example.  We
   do this by allocating large chunks and doling them out.  Calling
   uuconf_malloc_block will return a pointer to a magic cookie which
   can then be passed to uuconf_malloc and uuconf_free.  Passing the
   pointer to uuconf_free_block will free all memory allocated for
   that block.  */

   will make the actual structure 1024 bytes, which may be convenient
   for some types of memory allocators.  */
