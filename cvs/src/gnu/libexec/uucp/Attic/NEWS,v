@Changes in version 1.06:

    As usual, many bugs were fixed.

    Support was added for the 'y' protocol, contributed by Jorge Cwik,
    the designer of the protocol.

    The name of command files was changed when using SPOOLDIR_TAYLOR;
    they now use a much longer sequence number.  This affects the
    jobid strings reported by uustat.  The change makes uux and uucp
    more efficient.

    Added ``called-timegrade'' command to sys file.

    Added --nostop and -E/--escape options to cu.

    Added -s option to uuchk.

    Added ``strip-login'' and ``strip-proto'' commands to config file.

    uux will now create a poll file if invoked as ``uux SYSTEM!''.

    If an execution fails, the data file is saved, if there is enough
    free disk space.

    uux now uses POSIX file locking, if available, when locking the
    sequence file.

    The man pages were incorporated into the Texinfo manual.

    The UUCP Internals FAQ was incorporated into the Texinfo manual.

    The spool directory layout is now documented in the Texinfo
    manual.

Changes in version 1.05:

    As usual, many bugs were fixed.

    Support was added for the UUPC/extended 'v' protocol.

    Initial hardware flow control support was added, contributed by
    Peter Wemm.

    A new port type, ``pipe'', was added; this sends data to a program
    such as rlogin, and was contributed by Marc Boucher.

    The programs all now accept long option names with a leading --.
    They all support --help and --version.

    uuxqt now saves execution files it can not parse in
    $(SPOOLDIR)/.Corrupt.

    If a received file can not be moved to the final location, and
    there is enough disk space, it is kept in the spool directory.

    A run-uuxqt command was added to config, to permit specifying when
    uuxqt should be run.

    The 'i' protocol has a new ack-frequency protocol parameter.  The
    remote-window protocol parameter was removed, as it did not work
    correctly.

    Chat scripts now permit /W in an expect string to set the timeout.

    TCP ports now support the ``dialer-sequence'' command.

    Direct ports now support the ``carrier'' command.

    Some support was added to read UUCP passwords from /etc/passwd,
    and to use encrypted passwords.

    uucico now accepts a -C argument to only call a system named by -S
    or -s if there is work for it.

    uucico accepts a -i TLI argument to use TLI I/O calls on standard
    input.

    uucico accepts a -u argument to set the user name.

    uucico accepts a -z argument to try the next alternate if a call
    fails.

    uustat accepts a -R argument to rejuvenate each listed job.
    
    Mailer configuration was moved from configure checking to
    policy.h.

    Support was added for QNX, contributed by Joe Wells.

Changes in version 1.04:

IMPORTANT: the default when talking to another version of 1.04 is to
use the new bidirectional 'i' protocol.  If you are using a
half-duplex modem, such as a Telebit T2500, you will want to either
mark the port as half-duplex with the ``half-duplex'' command, or
force use of the 'g' protocol by using the ``protocol'' command in the
sys or port file or by adding ``,g'' after the port name in the
Systems or L.sys or Devices file.

    As usual, many bugs were fixed.

    Bidirectional transfers are supported with the new 'i' protocol;
    it requires an eight-bit clear datapath.

    New programs: uusched, cu, uuto and uupick.

    The 'G' protocol and a new Zmodem protocol were added.

    A number of uustat options were added to support uuclean, and a
    sample uuclean shell script was added to the contrib directory.
    The uustat output formats were changed slightly.

    A protocol extension eliminates transfer of the command file for
    simple commands, such as rmail or rnews, when talking to another
    version of 1.04.

    Some TLI support was added.

    UUCP forwarding was added, along with the ``forward-to'',
    ``forward-from'' and ``forward'' commands.

    If a file transfer fails in the middle, the retry will now start
    from where it left off.  The implementation is compatible with
    SVR4.

    The work queue is checked every 10 minutes during a conversation;
    if there is new work and a bidirectional protocol is not in use,
    the receiving uucico requests the sender to transfer control.

    The amount of free disk space is checked periodically as a file is
    received, and if it drops too low the call is aborted.

    The UUCP configuration file reading routines were moved into a
    standalone library, uuconf.  All known bugs in V2 and HDB
    configuration file reading were fixed.

    The ``half-duplex'' command was added for the port and dialer
    files.

    The ``max-retries'', ``success-wait'', ``send-request'' and
    ``receive-request'' commands were added for the sys file.  The
    ``call-request'' and ``called-request'' commands were eliminated
    (they did not work correctly anyhow).

    \d in chat scripts now calls sleep (2) rather than sleep (1), so
    it will sleep longer (on some systems sleep(1) may delay much less
    than one second).

    SPOOLDIR_SVR4 was added for SVR4 style spool directories.

    Defaults are now permitted in the port and dialer files.

    The ALIAS field is supported in the HDB Permissions file.
