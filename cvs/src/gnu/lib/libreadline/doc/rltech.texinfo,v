@@node Programming with GNU Readline
@@chapter Programming with GNU Readline

This chapter describes the interface between the @@sc{gnu} Readline Library and
other programs.  If you are a programmer, and you wish to include the
features found in @@sc{gnu} Readline
such as completion, line editing, and interactive history manipulation
in your own programs, this section is for you.

@@node Basic Behavior
@@section Basic Behavior

Many programs provide a command line interface, such as @@code{mail},
@@code{ftp}, and @@code{sh}.  For such programs, the default behaviour of
Readline is sufficient.  This section describes how to use Readline in
the simplest way possible, perhaps to replace calls in your code to
@@code{gets()} or @@code{fgets()}.

@@findex readline
@@cindex readline, function

The function @@code{readline()} prints a prompt @@var{prompt}
and then reads and returns a single line of text from the user.
If @@var{prompt} is @@code{NULL} or the empty string, no prompt is displayed.
The line @@code{readline} returns is allocated with @@code{malloc()};
the caller should @@code{free()} the line when it has finished with it.
The declaration for @@code{readline} in ANSI C is

@@example
@@code{char *readline (const char *@@var{prompt});}
@@end example

@@noindent
So, one might say
@@example
@@code{char *line = readline ("Enter a line: ");}
@@end example
@@noindent
in order to read a line of text from the user.
The line returned has the final newline removed, so only the
text remains.

If @@code{readline} encounters an @@code{EOF} while reading the line, and the
line is empty at that point, then @@code{(char *)NULL} is returned.
Otherwise, the line is ended just as if a newline had been typed.

If you want the user to be able to get at the line later, (with
@@key{C-p} for example), you must call @@code{add_history()} to save the
line away in a @@dfn{history} list of such lines.

@@example
@@code{add_history (line)};
@@end example

@@noindent
For full details on the GNU History Library, see the associated manual.

It is preferable to avoid saving empty lines on the history list, since
users rarely have a burning need to reuse a blank line.  Here is
a function which usefully replaces the standard @@code{gets()} library
function, and has the advantage of no static buffer to overflow:

@@example
/* A static variable for holding the line. */
static char *line_read = (char *)NULL;

/* Read a string, and return a pointer to it.
   Returns NULL on EOF. */
char *
rl_gets ()
@@{
  /* If the buffer has already been allocated,
     return the memory to the free pool. */
  if (line_read)
    @@{
      free (line_read);
      line_read = (char *)NULL;
    @@}

  /* Get a line from the user. */
  line_read = readline ("");

  /* If the line has any text in it,
     save it on the history. */
  if (line_read && *line_read)
    add_history (line_read);

  return (line_read);
@@}
@@end example

This function gives the user the default behaviour of @@key{TAB}
completion: completion on file names.  If you do not want Readline to
complete on filenames, you can change the binding of the @@key{TAB} key
with @@code{rl_bind_key()}.

@@example
@@code{int rl_bind_key (int @@var{key}, rl_command_func_t *@@var{function});}
@@end example

@@code{rl_bind_key()} takes two arguments: @@var{key} is the character that
you want to bind, and @@var{function} is the address of the function to
call when @@var{key} is pressed.  Binding @@key{TAB} to @@code{rl_insert()}
makes @@key{TAB} insert itself.
@@code{rl_bind_key()} returns non-zero if @@var{key} is not a valid
ASCII character code (between 0 and 255).

Thus, to disable the default @@key{TAB} behavior, the following suffices:
@@example
@@code{rl_bind_key ('\t', rl_insert);}
@@end example

This code should be executed once at the start of your program; you
might write a function called @@code{initialize_readline()} which
performs this and other desired initializations, such as installing
custom completers (@@pxref{Custom Completers}).

@@node Custom Functions
@@section Custom Functions

Readline provides many functions for manipulating the text of
the line, but it isn't possible to anticipate the needs of all
programs.  This section describes the various functions and variables
defined within the Readline library which allow a user program to add
customized functionality to Readline.

Before declaring any functions that customize Readline's behavior, or
using any functionality Readline provides in other code, an
application writer should include the file @@code{<readline/readline.h>}
in any file that uses Readline's features.  Since some of the definitions
in @@code{readline.h} use the @@code{stdio} library, the file
@@code{<stdio.h>} should be included before @@code{readline.h}.

@@code{readline.h} defines a C preprocessor variable that should
be treated as an integer, @@code{RL_READLINE_VERSION}, which may
be used to conditionally compile application code depending on
the installed Readline version.  The value is a hexadecimal
encoding of the major and minor version numbers of the library,
of the form 0x@@var{MMmm}.  @@var{MM} is the two-digit major
version number; @@var{mm} is the two-digit minor version number. 
For Readline 4.2, for example, the value of
@@code{RL_READLINE_VERSION} would be @@code{0x0402}.

@@node Readline Typedefs
@@subsection Readline Typedefs

For readabilty, we declare a number of new object types, all pointers
to functions.

The reason for declaring these new types is to make it easier to write
code describing pointers to C functions with appropriately prototyped
arguments and return values.

For instance, say we want to declare a variable @@var{func} as a pointer
to a function which takes two @@code{int} arguments and returns an
@@code{int} (this is the type of all of the Readline bindable functions).
Instead of the classic C declaration

@@code{int (*func)();}

@@noindent
or the ANSI-C style declaration

@@code{int (*func)(int, int);}

@@noindent
we may write

@@code{rl_command_func_t *func;}

The full list of function pointer types available is

@@table @@code
@@item typedef int rl_command_func_t (int, int);

@@item typedef char *rl_compentry_func_t (const char *, int);

@@node Function Writing
@@subsection Writing a New Function

In order to write new functions for Readline, you need to know the
calling conventions for keyboard-invoked functions, and the names of the
variables that describe the current state of the line read so far.

The calling sequence for a command @@code{foo} looks like

@@example
@@code{int foo (int count, int key)}
@@end example

@@noindent
where @@var{count} is the numeric argument (or 1 if defaulted) and
@@var{key} is the key that invoked this function.

It is completely up to the function as to what should be done with the
numeric argument.  Some functions use it as a repeat count, some
as a flag, and others to choose alternate behavior (refreshing the current
line as opposed to refreshing the screen, for example).  Some choose to
ignore it.  In general, if a
function uses the numeric argument as a repeat count, it should be able
to do something useful with both negative and positive arguments.
At the very least, it should be aware that it can be passed a
negative argument.

A command function should return 0 if its action completes successfully,
and a non-zero value if some error occurs.

@@node Readline Variables
@@section Readline Variables

These variables are available to function writers.

@@deftypevar {char *} rl_line_buffer
This is the line gathered so far.  You are welcome to modify the
contents of the line, but see @@ref{Allowing Undoing}.  The
function @@code{rl_extend_line_buffer} is available to increase
the memory allocated to @@code{rl_line_buffer}.
@@end deftypevar

@@deftypevar int rl_point
The offset of the current cursor position in @@code{rl_line_buffer}
(the @@emph{point}).
@@end deftypevar

@@deftypevar int rl_end
The number of characters present in @@code{rl_line_buffer}.  When
@@code{rl_point} is at the end of the line, @@code{rl_point} and
@@code{rl_end} are equal.
@@end deftypevar

@@deftypevar int rl_mark
The @@var{mark} (saved position) in the current line.  If set, the mark
and point define a @@emph{region}.
@@end deftypevar

@@deftypevar int rl_done
Setting this to a non-zero value causes Readline to return the current
line immediately.
@@end deftypevar

@@deftypevar int rl_num_chars_to_read
Setting this to a positive value before calling @@code{readline()} causes
Readline to return after accepting that many characters, rather
than reading up to a character bound to @@code{accept-line}.
@@end deftypevar

@@deftypevar int rl_pending_input
Setting this to a value makes it the next keystroke read.  This is a
way to stuff a single character into the input stream.
@@end deftypevar

@@deftypevar int rl_dispatching
Set to a non-zero value if a function is being called from a key binding;
zero otherwise.  Application functions can test this to discover whether
they were called directly or by Readline's dispatching mechanism.
@@end deftypevar

@@deftypevar int rl_erase_empty_line
Setting this to a non-zero value causes Readline to completely erase
the current line, including any prompt, any time a newline is typed as
the only character on an otherwise-empty line.  The cursor is moved to
the beginning of the newly-blank line.
@@end deftypevar

@@deftypevar {char *} rl_prompt
The prompt Readline uses.  This is set from the argument to
@@code{readline()}, and should not be assigned to directly.
The @@code{rl_set_prompt()} function (@@pxref{Redisplay}) may
be used to modify the prompt string after calling @@code{readline()}.
@@end deftypevar

@@deftypevar int rl_already_prompted
If an application wishes to display the prompt itself, rather than have
Readline do it the first time @@code{readline()} is called, it should set
this variable to a non-zero value after displaying the prompt.
The prompt must also be passed as the argument to @@code{readline()} so
the redisplay functions can update the display properly.
The calling application is responsible for managing the value; Readline
never sets it.
@@end deftypevar

@@deftypevar {const char *} rl_library_version
The version number of this revision of the library.
@@end deftypevar

@@deftypevar int rl_readline_version
An integer encoding the current version of the library.  The encoding is
of the form 0x@@var{MMmm}, where @@var{MM} is the two-digit major version
number, and @@var{mm} is the two-digit minor version number.
For example, for Readline-4.2, @@code{rl_readline_version} would have the
value 0x0402.
@@end deftypevar

@@deftypevar {int} rl_gnu_readline_p
Always set to 1, denoting that this is @@sc{gnu} readline rather than some
emulation.
@@end deftypevar

@@deftypevar {const char *} rl_terminal_name
The terminal type, used for initialization.  If not set by the application,
Readline sets this to the value of the @@env{TERM} environment variable
the first time it is called.
@@end deftypevar

@@deftypevar {const char *} rl_readline_name
This variable is set to a unique name by each application using Readline.
The value allows conditional parsing of the inputrc file
(@@pxref{Conditional Init Constructs}).
@@end deftypevar

@@deftypevar {FILE *} rl_instream
The stdio stream from which Readline reads input.
If @@code{NULL}, Readline defaults to @@var{stdin}.
@@end deftypevar

@@deftypevar {FILE *} rl_outstream
The stdio stream to which Readline performs output.
If @@code{NULL}, Readline defaults to @@var{stdout}.
@@end deftypevar

@@deftypevar {rl_command_func_t *} rl_last_func
The address of the last command function Readline executed.  May be used to
test whether or not a function is being executed twice in succession, for
example.
@@end deftypevar

@@deftypevar {rl_hook_func_t *} rl_startup_hook
If non-zero, this is the address of a function to call just
before @@code{readline} prints the first prompt.
@@end deftypevar

@@deftypevar {rl_hook_func_t *} rl_pre_input_hook
If non-zero, this is the address of a function to call after
the first prompt has been printed and just before @@code{readline}
starts reading input characters.
@@end deftypevar

@@deftypevar {rl_hook_func_t *} rl_event_hook
If non-zero, this is the address of a function to call periodically
when Readline is waiting for terminal input.
By default, this will be called at most ten times a second if there
is no keyboard input.
@@end deftypevar

@@deftypevar {rl_getc_func_t *} rl_getc_function
If non-zero, Readline will call indirectly through this pointer
to get a character from the input stream.  By default, it is set to
@@code{rl_getc}, the default Readline character input function
(@@pxref{Character Input}).
@@end deftypevar

@@deftypevar {rl_voidfunc_t *} rl_redisplay_function
If non-zero, Readline will call indirectly through this pointer
to update the display with the current contents of the editing buffer.
By default, it is set to @@code{rl_redisplay}, the default Readline
redisplay function (@@pxref{Redisplay}).
@@end deftypevar

@@deftypevar {rl_vintfunc_t *} rl_prep_term_function
If non-zero, Readline will call indirectly through this pointer
to initialize the terminal.  The function takes a single argument, an
@@code{int} flag that says whether or not to use eight-bit characters.
By default, this is set to @@code{rl_prep_terminal}
(@@pxref{Terminal Management}).
@@end deftypevar

@@deftypevar {rl_voidfunc_t *} rl_deprep_term_function
If non-zero, Readline will call indirectly through this pointer
to reset the terminal.  This function should undo the effects of
@@code{rl_prep_term_function}.
By default, this is set to @@code{rl_deprep_terminal}
(@@pxref{Terminal Management}).

@@node Function Naming
@@subsection Naming a Function

The user can dynamically change the bindings of keys while using
Readline.  This is done by representing the function with a descriptive
name.  The user is able to type the descriptive name when referring to
the function.  Thus, in an init file, one might find

@@example
Meta-Rubout:	backward-kill-word
@@end example

This binds the keystroke @@key{Meta-Rubout} to the function
@@emph{descriptively} named @@code{backward-kill-word}.  You, as the
programmer, should bind the functions you write to descriptive names as
well.  Readline provides a function for doing that:

@@deftypefun int rl_add_defun (const char *name, rl_command_func_t *function, int key)
Add @@var{name} to the list of named functions.  Make @@var{function} be
the function that gets called.  If @@var{key} is not -1, then bind it to
@@var{function} using @@code{rl_bind_key()}.
@@end deftypefun

Using this function alone is sufficient for most applications.  It is
the recommended way to add a few functions to the default functions that
Readline has built in.  If you need to do something other
than adding a function to Readline, you may need to use the
underlying functions described below.

@@node Keymaps
@@subsection Selecting a Keymap

Key bindings take place on a @@dfn{keymap}.  The keymap is the
association between the keys that the user types and the functions that
get run.  You can make your own keymaps, copy existing keymaps, and tell
Readline which keymap to use.

@@deftypefun Keymap rl_make_bare_keymap (void)
Returns a new, empty keymap.  The space for the keymap is allocated with
@@code{malloc()}; the caller should free it by calling
@@code{rl_discard_keymap()} when done.
@@end deftypefun

@@deftypefun Keymap rl_copy_keymap (Keymap map)
Return a new keymap which is a copy of @@var{map}.
@@end deftypefun

@@deftypefun Keymap rl_make_keymap (void)
Return a new keymap with the printing characters bound to rl_insert,
the lowercase Meta characters bound to run their equivalents, and
the Meta digits bound to produce numeric arguments.
@@end deftypefun

@@deftypefun void rl_discard_keymap (Keymap keymap)
Free the storage associated with @@var{keymap}.
@@end deftypefun

Readline has several internal keymaps.  These functions allow you to

@@node Binding Keys
@@subsection Binding Keys

Key sequences are associate with functions through the keymap.
Readline has several internal keymaps: @@code{emacs_standard_keymap},
@@code{emacs_meta_keymap}, @@code{emacs_ctlx_keymap},
@@code{vi_movement_keymap}, and @@code{vi_insertion_keymap}.
@@code{emacs_standard_keymap} is the default, and the examples in
this manual assume that.

Since @@code{readline()} installs a set of default key bindings the first
time it is called, there is always the danger that a custom binding
installed before the first call to @@code{readline()} will be overridden.
An alternate mechanism is to install custom key bindings in an
initialization function assigned to the @@code{rl_startup_hook} variable
(@@pxref{Readline Variables}).

These functions manage key bindings.

@@deftypefun int rl_bind_key (int key, rl_command_func_t *function)

@@node Allowing Undoing
@@subsection Allowing Undoing

Supporting the undo command is a painless thing, and makes your
functions much more useful.  It is certainly easy to try
something if you know you can undo it.

If your function simply inserts text once, or deletes text once, and
uses @@code{rl_insert_text()} or @@code{rl_delete_text()} to do it, then
undoing is already done for you automatically.

If you do multiple insertions or multiple deletions, or any combination
of these operations, you should group them together into one operation.
This is done with @@code{rl_begin_undo_group()} and
@@code{rl_end_undo_group()}.

The types of events that can be undone are:

@@smallexample
enum undo_code @@{ UNDO_DELETE, UNDO_INSERT, UNDO_BEGIN, UNDO_END @@}; 
@@end smallexample

Notice that @@code{UNDO_DELETE} means to insert some text, and
@@code{UNDO_INSERT} means to delete some text.  That is, the undo code
tells what to undo, not how to undo it.  @@code{UNDO_BEGIN} and
@@code{UNDO_END} are tags added by @@code{rl_begin_undo_group()} and
@@code{rl_end_undo_group()}.

@@deftypefun int rl_begin_undo_group (void)
Begins saving undo information in a group construct.  The undo
information usually comes from calls to @@code{rl_insert_text()} and
@@code{rl_delete_text()}, but could be the result of calls to
@@code{rl_add_undo()}.
@@end deftypefun

@@deftypefun int rl_end_undo_group (void)
Closes the current undo group started with @@code{rl_begin_undo_group
()}.  There should be one call to @@code{rl_end_undo_group()}
for each call to @@code{rl_begin_undo_group()}.
@@end deftypefun

@@deftypefun void rl_add_undo (enum undo_code what, int start, int end, char *text)
Remember how to undo an event (according to @@var{what}).  The affected
text runs from @@var{start} to @@var{end}, and encompasses @@var{text}.
@@end deftypefun

@@deftypefun void rl_free_undo_list (void)

@@end deftypefun

@@deftypefun int rl_do_undo (void)
Undo the first thing on the undo list.  Returns @@code{0} if there was
nothing to undo, non-zero if something was undone.
@@end deftypefun

Finally, if you neither insert nor delete text, but directly modify the
existing text (e.g., change its case), call @@code{rl_modifying()}
once, just before you modify the text.  You must supply the indices of
the text range that you are going to modify.

@@node Readline Signal Handling
@@section Readline Signal Handling

Signals are asynchronous events sent to a process by the Unix kernel,
sometimes on behalf of another process.  They are intended to indicate
exceptional events, like a user pressing the interrupt key on his terminal,
or a network connection being broken.  There is a class of signals that can
be sent to the process currently reading input from the keyboard.  Since
Readline changes the terminal attributes when it is called, it needs to
perform special processing when such a signal is received in order to
restore the terminal to a sane state, or provide application writers with
functions to do so manually. 

Readline contains an internal signal handler that is installed for a
number of signals (@@code{SIGINT}, @@code{SIGQUIT}, @@code{SIGTERM},
@@code{SIGALRM}, @@code{SIGTSTP}, @@code{SIGTTIN}, and @@code{SIGTTOU}).
When one of these signals is received, the signal handler
will reset the terminal attributes to those that were in effect before
@@code{readline()} was called, reset the signal handling to what it was
before @@code{readline()} was called, and resend the signal to the calling
application.
If and when the calling application's signal handler returns, Readline
will reinitialize the terminal and continue to accept input.
When a @@code{SIGINT} is received, the Readline signal handler performs
some additional work, which will cause any partially-entered line to be
aborted (see the description of @@code{rl_free_line_state()} below).

There is an additional Readline signal handler, for @@code{SIGWINCH}, which
the kernel sends to a process whenever the terminal's size changes (for
example, if a user resizes an @@code{xterm}).  The Readline @@code{SIGWINCH}
handler updates Readline's internal screen size information, and then calls
any @@code{SIGWINCH} signal handler the calling application has installed. 
Readline calls the application's @@code{SIGWINCH} signal handler without
resetting the terminal to its original state.  If the application's signal
handler does more than update its idea of the terminal size and return (for
example, a @@code{longjmp} back to a main processing loop), it @@emph{must}
call @@code{rl_cleanup_after_signal()} (described below), to restore the
terminal state. 

Readline provides two variables that allow application writers to
control whether or not it will catch certain signals and act on them
when they are received.  It is important that applications change the
values of these variables only when calling @@code{readline()}, not in
a signal handler, so Readline's internal signal state is not corrupted.

@@deftypevar int rl_catch_signals
If this variable is non-zero, Readline will install signal handlers for
@@code{SIGINT}, @@code{SIGQUIT}, @@code{SIGTERM}, @@code{SIGALRM},
@@code{SIGTSTP}, @@code{SIGTTIN}, and @@code{SIGTTOU}.

The default value of @@code{rl_catch_signals} is 1.

Typically, a program that reads commands from the user has a way of
disambiguating commands and data.  If your program is one of these, then
it can provide completion for commands, data, or both.
The following sections describe how your program and Readline
cooperate to provide this service.

@@node How Completing Works
@@subsection How Completing Works

In order to complete some text, the full list of possible completions
must be available.  That is, it is not possible to accurately
expand a partial word without knowing all of the possible words
which make sense in that context.  The Readline library provides
the user interface to completion, and two of the most common
completion functions:  filename and username.  For completing other types
of text, you must write your own completion function.  This section
describes exactly what such functions must do, and provides an example.

There are three major functions used to perform completion:

@@enumerate
@@item
The user-interface function @@code{rl_complete()}.  This function is
called with the same arguments as other bindable Readline functions:
@@var{count} and @@var{invoking_key}.
It isolates the word to be completed and calls
@@code{rl_completion_matches()} to generate a list of possible completions.
It then either lists the possible completions, inserts the possible
completions, or actually performs the
completion, depending on which behavior is desired.

@@item
The internal function @@code{rl_completion_matches()} uses an
application-supplied @@dfn{generator} function to generate the list of
possible matches, and then returns the array of these matches.
The caller should place the address of its generator function in
@@code{rl_completion_entry_function}.

@@item
The generator function is called repeatedly from
@@code{rl_completion_matches()}, returning a string each time.  The
arguments to the generator function are @@var{text} and @@var{state}.
@@var{text} is the partial word to be completed.  @@var{state} is zero the
first time the function is called, allowing the generator to perform
any necessary initialization, and a positive non-zero integer for
each subsequent call.  The generator function returns
@@code{(char *)NULL} to inform @@code{rl_completion_matches()} that there are
no more possibilities left.  Usually the generator function computes the
list of possible completions when @@var{state} is zero, and returns them
one at a time on subsequent calls.  Each string the generator function
returns as a match must be allocated with @@code{malloc()}; Readline
frees the strings when it has finished with them.

@@end enumerate

@@deftypefun int rl_complete (int ignore, int invoking_key)
Complete the word at or before point.  You have supplied the function
that does the initial simple matching selection algorithm (see
@@code{rl_completion_matches()}).  The default is to do filename completion.
@@end deftypefun

@@deftypevar {rl_compentry_func_t *} rl_completion_entry_function
This is a pointer to the generator function for
@@code{rl_completion_matches()}.
If the value of @@code{rl_completion_entry_function} is
@@code{NULL} then the default filename generator
function, @@code{rl_filename_completion_function()}, is used.
@@end deftypevar

@@node Completion Functions
@@subsection Completion Functions

Here is the complete list of callable completion functions present in
Readline.

@@deftypefun int rl_complete_internal (int what_to_do)
Complete the word at or before point.  @@var{what_to_do} says what to do
with the completion.  A value of @@samp{?} means list the possible
completions.  @@samp{TAB} means do standard completion.  @@samp{*} means
insert all of the possible completions.  @@samp{!} means to display
all of the possible completions, if there is more than one, as well as
performing partial completion.
@@end deftypefun

@@deftypefun int rl_complete (int ignore, int invoking_key)
Complete the word at or before point.  You have supplied the function
that does the initial simple matching selection algorithm (see
@@code{rl_completion_matches()} and @@code{rl_completion_entry_function}).
The default is to do filename
completion.  This calls @@code{rl_complete_internal()} with an
argument depending on @@var{invoking_key}.
@@end deftypefun

@@deftypefun int rl_possible_completions (int count, int invoking_key)
List the possible completions.  See description of @@code{rl_complete
()}.  This calls @@code{rl_complete_internal()} with an argument of
@@samp{?}.
@@end deftypefun

@@deftypefun int rl_insert_completions (int count, int invoking_key)
Insert the list of possible completions into the line, deleting the
partially-completed word.  See description of @@code{rl_complete()}.
This calls @@code{rl_complete_internal()} with an argument of @@samp{*}.
@@end deftypefun

@@deftypefun int rl_completion_mode (rl_command_func_t *cfunc)
Returns the apppriate value to pass to @@code{rl_complete_internal()}
depending on whether @@var{cfunc} was called twice in succession and
the value of the @@code{show-all-if-ambiguous} variable.
Application-specific completion functions may use this function to present
the same interface as @@code{rl_complete()}.
@@end deftypefun

@@deftypefun {char **} rl_completion_matches (const char *text, rl_compentry_func_t *entry_func)
Returns an array of strings which is a list of completions for
@@var{text}.  If there are no completions, returns @@code{NULL}.
The first entry in the returned array is the substitution for @@var{text}.
The remaining entries are the possible completions.  The array is
terminated with a @@code{NULL} pointer.

@@var{entry_func} is a function of two args, and returns a
@@code{char *}.  The first argument is @@var{text}.  The second is a
state argument; it is zero on the first call, and non-zero on subsequent
calls.  @@var{entry_func} returns a @@code{NULL}  pointer to the caller
when there are no more matches.
@@end deftypefun

@@deftypefun {char *} rl_filename_completion_function (const char *text, int state)
A generator function for filename completion in the general case.
@@var{text} is a partial filename.
The Bash source is a useful reference for writing custom
completion functions (the Bash completion functions call this and other
Readline functions).
@@end deftypefun

@@deftypefun {char *} rl_username_completion_function (const char *text, int state)
A completion generator for usernames.  @@var{text} contains a partial
username preceded by a random character (usually @@samp{~}).  As with all
completion generators, @@var{state} is zero on the first call and non-zero
for subsequent calls.
@@end deftypefun

@@node Completion Variables
@@subsection Completion Variables

@@deftypevar {rl_compentry_func_t *} rl_completion_entry_function
A pointer to the generator function for @@code{rl_completion_matches()}.
@@code{NULL} means to use @@code{rl_filename_completion_function()}, the default
filename completer.
@@end deftypevar

@@deftypevar {rl_completion_func_t *} rl_attempted_completion_function
A pointer to an alternative function to create matches.
The function is called with @@var{text}, @@var{start}, and @@var{end}.
@@var{start} and @@var{end} are indices in @@code{rl_line_buffer} defining
the boundaries of @@var{text}, which is a character string.
If this function exists and returns @@code{NULL}, or if this variable is
set to @@code{NULL}, then @@code{rl_complete()} will call the value of
@@code{rl_completion_entry_function} to generate matches, otherwise the
array of strings returned will be used.
If this function sets the @@code{rl_attempted_completion_over}
variable to a non-zero value, Readline will not perform its default
completion even if this function returns no matches.
@@end deftypevar

@@deftypevar {rl_quote_func_t *} rl_filename_quoting_function
A pointer to a function that will quote a filename in an
application-specific fashion.  This is called if filename completion is being
attempted and one of the characters in @@code{rl_filename_quote_characters}
appears in a completed filename.  The function is called with
@@var{text}, @@var{match_type}, and @@var{quote_pointer}.  The @@var{text}
is the filename to be quoted.  The @@var{match_type} is either
@@code{SINGLE_MATCH}, if there is only one completion match, or
@@code{MULT_MATCH}.  Some functions use this to decide whether or not to
insert a closing quote character.  The @@var{quote_pointer} is a pointer
to any opening quote character the user typed.  Some functions choose
to reset this character.
@@end deftypevar

@@deftypevar {rl_dequote_func_t *} rl_filename_dequoting_function
A pointer to a function that will remove application-specific quoting
characters from a filename before completion is attempted, so those
characters do not interfere with matching the text against names in
the filesystem.  It is called with @@var{text}, the text of the word
to be dequoted, and @@var{quote_char}, which is the quoting character 
that delimits the filename (usually @@samp{'} or @@samp{"}).  If
@@var{quote_char} is zero, the filename was not in an embedded string.
@@end deftypevar

@@deftypevar {rl_linebuf_func_t *} rl_char_is_quoted_p
A pointer to a function to call that determines whether or not a specific
character in the line buffer is quoted, according to whatever quoting
mechanism the program calling Readline uses.  The function is called with
two arguments: @@var{text}, the text of the line, and @@var{index}, the
index of the character in the line.  It is used to decide whether a
character found in @@code{rl_completer_word_break_characters} should be
used to break words for the completer.
@@end deftypevar

@@deftypevar {rl_compignore_func_t *} rl_ignore_some_completions_function
This function, if defined, is called by the completer when real filename
completion is done, after all the matching names have been generated.
It is passed a @@code{NULL} terminated array of matches.
The first element (@@code{matches[0]}) is the
maximal substring common to all matches. This function can
re-arrange the list of matches as required, but each element deleted
from the array must be freed.
@@end deftypevar

@@deftypevar {rl_icppfunc_t *} rl_directory_completion_hook
This function, if defined, is allowed to modify the directory portion
of filenames Readline completes.  It is called with the address of a
string (the current directory name) as an argument, and may modify that string.
If the string is replaced with a new string, the old value should be freed.
Any modified directory name should have a trailing slash.
The modified value will be displayed as part of the completion, replacing
the directory portion of the pathname the user typed.
It returns an integer that should be non-zero if the function modifies
its directory argument.
It could be used to expand symbolic links or shell variables in pathnames.
@@end deftypevar

@@deftypevar {rl_compdisp_func_t *} rl_completion_display_matches_hook
If non-zero, then this is the address of a function to call when
completing a word would normally display the list of possible matches.
This function is called in lieu of Readline displaying the list.
It takes three arguments:
(@@code{char **}@@var{matches}, @@code{int} @@var{num_matches}, @@code{int} @@var{max_length})
where @@var{matches} is the array of matching strings,
@@var{num_matches} is the number of strings in that array, and
@@var{max_length} is the length of the longest string in that array.
Readline provides a convenience function, @@code{rl_display_match_list},
that takes care of doing the display to Readline's output stream.  That
function may be called from this hook.
@@end deftypevar

@@deftypevar {const char *} rl_basic_word_break_characters
The basic list of characters that signal a break between words for the
completer routine.  The default value of this variable is the characters
which break words for completion in Bash:
@@code{" \t\n\"\\'`@@@@$><=;|&@@{("}.
@@end deftypevar

@@code{rl_complete_internal()}.  The default list is the value of
@@code{rl_basic_word_break_characters}.
@@end deftypevar

@@deftypevar {const char *} rl_completer_quote_characters
A list of characters which can be used to quote a substring of the line.
Completion occurs on the entire substring, and within the substring
@@code{rl_completer_word_break_characters} are treated as any other character,
unless they also appear within this list.
@@end deftypevar

@@deftypevar {const char *} rl_filename_quote_characters
A list of characters that cause a filename to be quoted by the completer
when they appear in a completed filename.  The default is the null string.
@@end deftypevar

@@deftypevar {const char *} rl_special_prefixes
The list of characters that are word break characters, but should be
left in @@var{text} when it is passed to the completion function.
Programs can use this to help determine what kind of completing to do.
For instance, Bash sets this variable to "$@@@@" so that it can complete
shell variables and hostnames.
@@end deftypevar

@@deftypevar int rl_completion_query_items
Up to this many items will be displayed in response to a
possible-completions call.  After that, we ask the user if she is sure
she wants to see them all.  The default value is 100.
@@end deftypevar

@@deftypevar {int} rl_completion_append_character
When a single completion alternative matches at the end of the command
line, this character is appended to the inserted completion text.  The
default is a space character (@@samp{ }).  Setting this to the null
character (@@samp{\0}) prevents anything being appended automatically.
This can be changed in custom completion functions to
provide the ``most sensible word separator character'' according to
an application-specific command line syntax specification.
@@end deftypevar

@@deftypevar int rl_completion_suppress_append
If non-zero, @@var{rl_completion_append_character} is not appended to
matches at the end of the command line, as described above.  It is
set to 0 before any application-specific completion function is called.
@@end deftypevar

@@deftypevar int rl_completion_mark_symlink_dirs
If non-zero, a slash will be appended to completed filenames that are
symbolic links to directory names, subject to the value of the
user-settable @@var{mark-directories} variable.
This variable exists so that application completion functions can
override the user's global preference (set via the
@@var{mark-symlinked-directories} Readline variable) if appropriate.
This variable is set to the user's preference before any
application completion function is called, so unless that function
modifies the value, the user's preferences are honored.
@@end deftypevar

@@deftypevar int rl_ignore_completion_duplicates
If non-zero, then duplicates in the matches are removed.
The default is 1.
@@end deftypevar

@@deftypevar int rl_filename_completion_desired
Non-zero means that the results of the matches are to be treated as
filenames.  This is @@emph{always} zero on entry, and can only be changed
within a completion entry generator function.  If it is set to a non-zero
value, directory names have a slash appended and Readline attempts to
quote completed filenames if they contain any characters in
@@code{rl_filename_quote_characters} and @@code{rl_filename_quoting_desired}
is set to a non-zero value.
@@end deftypevar

@@deftypevar int rl_filename_quoting_desired
Non-zero means that the results of the matches are to be quoted using
double quotes (or an application-specific quoting mechanism) if the
completed filename contains any characters in
@@code{rl_filename_quote_chars}.  This is @@emph{always} non-zero
on entry, and can only be changed within a completion entry generator
function.  The quoting is effected via a call to the function pointed to
by @@code{rl_filename_quoting_function}.
@@end deftypevar

@@deftypevar int rl_attempted_completion_over
If an application-specific completion function assigned to
@@code{rl_attempted_completion_function} sets this variable to a non-zero

For readabilty, we declare a number of new object types, all pointers
to functions.

The reason for declaring these new types is to make it easier to write
code describing pointers to C functions with appropriately prototyped
arguments and return values.

For instance, say we want to declare a variable @@var{func} as a pointer
to a function which takes two @@code{int} arguments and returns an
@@code{int} (this is the type of all of the Readline bindable functions).
