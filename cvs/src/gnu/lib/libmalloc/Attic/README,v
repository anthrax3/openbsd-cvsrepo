@This is the standalone distribution of GNU malloc.
GNU malloc is part of the GNU C Library, but is also distributed separately.

If you find bugs in GNU malloc, send reports to bug-glibc@@prep.ai.mit.edu.

GNU malloc is free software.  See the file COPYING.LIB for copying conditions.

The makefile builds libmalloc.a and gmalloc.o.  If you are using GNU malloc
to replace your system's existing malloc package, it is important to make
sure you get all GNU functions, not some of the GNU functions and some from
the system library.  gmalloc.o has all the functions in one file, so using
that will make sure you don't accidentally mix the two malloc packages.
