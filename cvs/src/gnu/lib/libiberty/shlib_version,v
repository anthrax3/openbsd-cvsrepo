1.10
log
@Switch time_t, ino_t, clock_t, and struct kevent's ident and data
members to 64bit types.  Assign new syscall numbers for (almost
all) the syscalls that involve the affected types, including anything
with time_t, timeval, itimerval, timespec, rusage, dirent, stat,
or kevent arguments.  Add a d_off member to struct dirent and replace
getdirentries() with getdents(), thus immensely simplifying and
accelerating telldir/seekdir.  Build perl with -DBIG_TIME.

Bump the major on every single base library: the compat bits included
here are only good enough to make the transition; the T32 compat
option will be burned as soon as we've reached the new world are
are happy with the snapshots for all architectures.

DANGER: ABI incompatibility.  Updating to this kernel requires extra
work or you won't be able to login: install a snapshot instead.

Much assistance in fixing userland issues from deraadt@@ and tedu@@
and build assistance from todd@@ and otto@@

@Add fopen_unlocked.c pex-unix.c pex-common.c unlink-if-ordinary.c to
the list of built files and switch the md5.h header to the libiberty
one. This change is needed by gcc4 and it is a major library crank for
libiberty.

log
@Merge OpenBSD specific changes:
- pexecute implementation replaced with the older gcc 2.95 implementation,
  as gcc 2.95's collect2 relies upon an implementation behaviour which has
  been lost in further libiberty updates.
- keep the old hash table interfaces, which are used by gcc 2.95.
- keep the OpenBSD replacement for the md5 interface.
- keep the OpenBSD strl{cat,cpy} and snprinft usage.

Bump libiberty minor version due to the addition of a few new symbols.
