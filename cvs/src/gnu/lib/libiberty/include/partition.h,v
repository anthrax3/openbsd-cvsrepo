log
@Merge OpenBSD specific changes:
- pexecute implementation replaced with the older gcc 2.95 implementation,
  as gcc 2.95's collect2 relies upon an implementation behaviour which has
  been lost in further libiberty updates.
- keep the old hash table interfaces, which are used by gcc 2.95.
- keep the OpenBSD replacement for the md5 interface.
- keep the OpenBSD strl{cat,cpy} and snprinft usage.

Bump libiberty minor version due to the addition of a few new symbols.

/* This package implements a partition of consecutive integers.  The
   elements are partitioned into classes.  Each class is represented
   by one of its elements, the canonical element, which is chosen
   arbitrarily from elements in the class.  The principal operations
   on a partition are FIND, which takes an element, determines its
   class, and returns the canonical element for that class, and UNION,
   which unites the two classes that contain two given elements into a
   single class.

   The list implementation used here provides constant-time finds.  By
   storing the size of each class with the class's canonical element,
   it is able to perform unions over all the classes in the partition
   in O (N log N) time.  */

@fix stupid cvs conflicts.
I think that cvs is a poor lonesome, depressive program.
The only way it has found of getting your attention is to throw
senseless conflicts that shouldn't exist in your way.
