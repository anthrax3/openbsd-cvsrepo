log
@Merge OpenBSD specific changes:
- pexecute implementation replaced with the older gcc 2.95 implementation,
  as gcc 2.95's collect2 relies upon an implementation behaviour which has
  been lost in further libiberty updates.
- keep the old hash table interfaces, which are used by gcc 2.95.
- keep the OpenBSD replacement for the md5 interface.
- keep the OpenBSD strl{cat,cpy} and snprinft usage.

Bump libiberty minor version due to the addition of a few new symbols.

@fix stupid cvs conflicts.
I think that cvs is a poor lonesome, depressive program.
The only way it has found of getting your attention is to throw
senseless conflicts that shouldn't exist in your way.
