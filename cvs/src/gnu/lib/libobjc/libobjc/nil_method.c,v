/* When the receiver of a method invocation is nil, the runtime
   returns nil_method() as the method implementation.  This function
   will be casted to whatever function was supposed to be executed to
   execute that method (that function will take an id, followed by a
   SEL, followed by who knows what arguments, depends on the method),
   and executed.
   
   For this reason, nil_method() should be a function which can be
   called in place of any function taking an 'id' argument followed by
   a 'SEL' argument, followed by zero, or one, or any number of
   arguments (both a fixed number, or a variable number !).
   
   There is no "proper" implementation of such a nil_method function
   in C, however in all existing implementations it does not matter
   when extra arguments are present, so we can simply create a function
   taking a receiver and a selector, and all other arguments will be
   ignored. :-)
