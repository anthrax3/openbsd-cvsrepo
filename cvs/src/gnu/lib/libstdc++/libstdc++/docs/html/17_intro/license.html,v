<h1 class="centered"><a name="top">Licenses for the Library</a></h1>

<p>There are two licenses affecting GNU libstdc++-v3:  one for the code, and
   one for the documentation.  Here we will describe both of them, and try
   to answer some of the widespread questions.  If you have more questions,
   ask the FSF or the
   <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/lists.html">gcc mailing list</a>; the person
   writing this page is a programmer, not a lawyer.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>The Code:  Runtime GPL</h2>

<p>The source code of libstdc++-v3 is distributed under version 2 of the
   <a href="COPYING">GNU General Public License</a>, with the so-called
   &quot;runtime exception,&quot; as follows (or see any header or
   implementation file):
</p>
<pre>
   As a special exception, you may use this file as part of a free software
   library without restriction.  Specifically, if other files instantiate
   templates or use macros or inline functions from this file, or you compile
   this file and link it with other files to produce an executable, this
   file does not by itself cause the resulting executable to be covered by
   the GNU General Public License.  This exception does not however
   invalidate any other reasons why the executable file might be covered by
   the GNU General Public License.
</pre>

<p>Hopefully that text is self-explanatory.  If it isn't, you need to speak
   to your lawyer, or the Free Software Foundation.
</p>

<!-- Most of the Q&A's are based on, paraphrased from, and outright stolen
     from this thread:
     http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/libstdc++/2000-q2/subjects.html#00050
-->
<p><strong>Q:  So any program which uses libstdc++ falls under the GPL?</strong>
 <br />A:  <strong>No.</strong>  The special exception permits use of the
     library in proprietary applications.
</p>

<p><strong>Q:  How is that different from the GNU {Lesser,Library}
   GPL?</strong>
 <!-- Quoting Jason Merrill from the thread above: -->
 <br />A:  The LGPL requires that users be able to replace the LGPL code with a
     modified version; this is trivial if the library in question is a C
     shared library.  But there's no way to make that work with C++, where
     much of the library consists of inline functions and templates, which
     are expanded inside the code that uses the library.  So to allow people
     to replace the library code, someone using the library would have to
     distribute their own source, rendering the LGPL equivalent to the GPL.
</p>

<p><strong>Q:  I see.  So, what restrictions <em>are</em> there on
   programs that use the library?</strong>
 <br />A:  None.  We encourage such programs to be released as open source,
     but we won't punish you or sue you if you choose otherwise.
</p>

<hr />

<h2>The Docs:  FDL</h2>

<p>The documentation shipped with the library and made available over the
   web, including the pages generated from source comments, are copyrighted
   by the Free Software Foundation, and placed under
   the <a href="COPYING.DOC">GNU Free Documentation License version 1.1</a>.
   There are no Front-Cover Texts, no Back-Cover Texts, and
   <!-- as far as I know -->
   no Invariant Sections.
</p>

<p>If you plan on making copies of the documentation, please let us know.
   We can probably offer suggestions.
