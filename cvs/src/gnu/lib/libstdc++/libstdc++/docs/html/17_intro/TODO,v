@- audit for places where __builtin_expect can be used.

- coordinate with "C" library people the "C" compatibility headers.
  Explain why an ISO-14882-conformant solution is hopeless, with the current
  twisted morass of "C" headers.

- do more doxygen manpages

- implement __convert_to_v and __convert_from_v without "C" library
functions and and LANG environment variable dependencies.

- use localedata to implement generic named (non-MT-safe) locales?
Figure out a way to use ICU data, like libjava?

- tuning for executable size, compilation speed, startup allocation,
executable speed.

- benchmarking addition to the testsuite that does the above.

- implement testing for symbol versioning for ELF targets.

- review streambuf, filebuf, stringbuf to optimize data member
placement.  Do pback bits need to be in streambuf? How about
_M_set_indeterminate, etc?

- Think about naming all member data and member functions consistently
as per
funtions: _M_verb_adverb
data: _M_noun_adjective

- exception specifications need to be reviewed for all parts of the
library support and utility areas, particularly <new>. 

- scoping/linking issues WRT to C structs need to be worked out. See
Nathan's commentary on cantrip, http://www.cantrip.org/cheaders.html

- triglyphs/ciso646: and, and_eq, bitand, bitor, compl, not, not_eq,
or, or_eq, xor, xor_eq, true && 45, true and false, true or 45, etc.
(bool and int), etc.

- operator!= and utility/rel_ops operators need to be made safe with
string and vector iterator classes. basic_string::reverse_iterator may
be implemented incorrectly, or need things like
operator==(__normal_iterator, const char*&), and swap(vector)

- auto_ptr: seems to be some disagreement on what is
standards-conformant behavior, specially on conversion operators.

- header optimizations to keep compile times reasonable are most
certainly detracting from full conformance, as many templatized
definitions are squired away and pre-instantiated, so that the
compiler doesn't have to parse them. Areas effected: valarray, string,
all of iostreams and locales.

- C-related issues WRT to libio and filepos, mbstate_t. Need to
straighten this stuff out with the glibc-2.2 libio. Also may need to
define operators for mbstate_t so that 'mbstate_t& == mbstate_t' is
something that can be done.

- looks like deque::get_allocator not standards conformant or deque
allocator non-standard.

- list::assignment operator needs const_cast

- a cleaner division between pointers-to-value_type and true iterators
needs to be drawn throughout the entire STL implementation.

- priority_queue conversions may be non-conformant

- 'do the right thing' ctor fixing needs to be done for string. This
is still subject to some debate on the library issues list, so I
suggest punting till the dust clears.

- Protect valarray::result_type (not Standard) and make it work with
  the various helper classes.

- Make sure `valarray<bool> & == _Expr<_BinClos<logical_or,_ValArray,_ValArray,double,double>,bool>' 
  is defined

- known issues WRT to io and corner cases with the buffers. This is
still subject to interpretation, and I think the current
implementation is credible.

- All of the Library working group closed issues need to be
addressed. Some of them proposed resolutions are already in the v-3
sources, with macro-guards.

- add deprecated features from Annex D
  - add #ifdef wrappers for all of them, including in each
    C <xxx.h> header
  - replace typedef'd non-deprecated types with more type-safe equivalents.

- add optimization hooks (esp. whitespace eating) to streambuf
  - add _M_begin() and _M_end() to streambuf
  - add algorithm specializations for [io]streambuf_iterator (copy find etc.)

- fix template members of basic_string<> to overload iterators and
  non-iterators properly.  (This is the infamous hack as in vector<> etc
  23.1.1 para 10.)

- write filebuf for wide characters

- add feature-test macros for non-standard extensions

- create MT abstraction layer

- add MT support for locale, string, istream, ostream

- provide testsuites for numerics.

- add FAQ entries -- improve the install instructions

- add HOWTO entries
