@Align suseconds_t with POSIX: it's the type of the tv_usec member of timeval.
Use useconds_t in the ualarm() declaration.
Bump libstdc++ major to be sure there isn't ABI issues.

1.9
log
@Switch time_t, ino_t, clock_t, and struct kevent's ident and data
members to 64bit types.  Assign new syscall numbers for (almost
all) the syscalls that involve the affected types, including anything
with time_t, timeval, itimerval, timespec, rusage, dirent, stat,
or kevent arguments.  Add a d_off member to struct dirent and replace
getdirentries() with getdents(), thus immensely simplifying and
accelerating telldir/seekdir.  Build perl with -DBIG_TIME.

Bump the major on every single base library: the compat bits included
here are only good enough to make the transition; the T32 compat
option will be burned as soon as we've reached the new world are
are happy with the snapshots for all architectures.

DANGER: ABI incompatibility.  Updating to this kernel requires extra
work or you won't be able to login: install a snapshot instead.

Much assistance in fixing userland issues from deraadt@@ and tedu@@

log
@martynas added support for the 'long double' math functions to libm at
c2k11, so libstdc++-v3 should make use of them.  Major version bump
for good measure, and sync libstdc++'s shlib_version with
libstdc++-v3's.

@Finalize work on the math library.  It's time to do this monster
commit, and deal with problems (if any) in tree.

Note that this adds the following functions.  Ports with hacks might
need adjustments.

nexttoward(3), fma(3), nexttowardf(3), fmaf(3), acoshl(3), asinhl(3),
atanhl(3), coshl(3), sinhl(3), tanhl(3), expl(3), expm1l(3), logl(3),
log10l(3), log1pl(3), log2l(3), modfl(3), cbrtl(3), hypotl(3),
powl(3), erfl(3), erfcl(3), lgammal(3), tgammal(3), ceill(3),
floorl(3), lrintl(3), llrintl(3), roundl(3), lroundl(3), llroundl(3),
truncl(3), fmodl(3), remainderl(3), remquol(3), nextafterl(3),
nexttowardl(3), fmal(3).

With this commit, our library implements all functionality required
by C99.  Documentation bits will follow.
