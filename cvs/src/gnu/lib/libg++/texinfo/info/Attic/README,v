@The file NEWS contains information about what has changed since the last
release.

The file ../INSTALL contains instructions on how to install Info.


Info 2.0 is a complete rewrite of the original standalone Info I wrote in
1987, the first program I wrote for rms.  That program was something like
my second Unix program ever, and my die-hard machine language coding habits
tended to show through.  I found the original Info hard to read and
maintain, and thus decided to write this one.

The rewrite consists of about 12,000 lines of code written in about 12
days.  I believe this version of Info to be in much better shape than the
original Info, and the only reason it is in Beta test is because of its
short life span.

Info 2.0 is substantially different from its original standalone
predecessor.  It appears almost identical to the GNU Emacs version, but has
the advantages of smaller size, ease of portability, and a built in library
which can be used in other programs (to get or display documentation from
Info files, for example).

I eagerly await responses to this newer version of Info; comments on its
portability, ease of use and user interface, code quality, and general
usefulness are all of interest to me, and I will appreciate any comments
that you would care to make.

A full listing of the commands available in Info can be gotten by typing
`?' while within an Info window.  This produces a node in a window which
can be viewed just like any Info node.

Please send your comments, bug reports, and suggestions to
