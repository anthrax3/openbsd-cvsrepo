  An AllocRing holds the last n malloc'ed strings, reallocating/reusing 
  one only when the queue wraps around. It thus guarantees that the
  last n allocations are intact. It is useful for things like I/O
  formatting where reasonable restrictions may be made about the
  number of allowable live allocations before auto-deletion.
