/* Initializes a List_Node.  This requires obtaining memory for the CHAR_SET

   both pointers to the different offsets into the same block of dynamic memory pointed 
   to by parameter K. The data member REST is used to store any additional fields 
   of the input file (it is set to the "" string if Option[TYPE] is not enabled).
   This is useful if the user wishes to incorporate a lookup structure,
   rather than just an array of keys.  Finally, KEY_NUMBER contains a count
   of the total number of keys seen so far.  This is used to initialize
   the INDEX field to some useful value. */
