@		   README for GNU development tools

This directory contains various GNU compilers, assemblers, linkers, 
debuggers, etc., plus their support routines, definitions, and documentation.

If you are receiving this as part of a GDB release, see the file gdb/README.
If with a gas release, see gas/README;  if with a libg++ release,
see libg++/README, etc.  That'll give you info about this
package -- supported targets, how to use it, how to report bugs, etc.

It is now possible to automatically configure and build a variety of
tools with one command.  To build all of the tools contained herein,
run the ``configure'' script here, e.g.:

	./configure 
	make

If the configure script can't determine your type of computer, give it
the name as an argument, for instance ``./configure sun4''.  You can
use the script ``config.sub'' to test whether a name is recognized; if
it is, config.sub translates it to a triplet specifying CPU, vendor,
and OS.)

If you have more than one compiler on your system, it is often best to
explicitly set CC in the environment before running configure, and to
also set CC when running make.  For example (assuming sh/bash/ksh):

	CC=gcc ./configure
	make CC=gcc

A similar example using csh:

	setenv CC gcc
	./configure
	make CC=gcc

See etc/cfg-paper.texi, etc/configure.texi, and/or the README files in
various subdirectories, for more details.

Much of the code and documentation enclosed, and this file, is
copyright 1993 by the Free Software Foundation, Inc.  See the file
COPYING or COPYING.LIB in the various directories, for a description of
the GNU General Public License terms under which you can copy the
files.

REPORTING BUGS: Again, see gdb/README, gas/README, etc., for info on where and
how to report problems.
