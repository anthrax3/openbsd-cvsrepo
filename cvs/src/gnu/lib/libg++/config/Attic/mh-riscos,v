@old libg++, replaced by part of egcs.

@# This is for a MIPS running RISC/os 4.52C.

# This is needed for GDB, but needs to be in the top-level make because
# if a library is compiled with the bsd headers and gets linked with the
# sysv system libraries all hell can break loose (e.g. a jmp_buf might be
# a different size).
# ptrace(2) apparently has problems in the BSD environment.  No workaround is
# known except to select the sysv environment.  Could we use /proc instead?
# These "sysv environments" and "bsd environments" often end up being a pain.
#
# This is not part of CFLAGS because perhaps not all C compilers have this
# option.
