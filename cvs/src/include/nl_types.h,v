@First pass at removing clauses 3 and 4 from NetBSD licenses.

Not sure what's more surprising: how long it took for NetBSD to
catch up to the rest of the BSDs (including UCB), or the amount of
code that NetBSD has claimed for itself without attributing to the
actual authors.

@Part one of userland __P removal.  Done with a simple regexp with some minor hand editing to make comments line up correctly.  Another pass is forthcoming that handles the cases that could not be done automatically.

@Well, as we are heading for a release people are encouraged to rebuild their
entire trees for testing anyway, I might as well do this intrusive touching
of include files now.  Added openBSD tags.
