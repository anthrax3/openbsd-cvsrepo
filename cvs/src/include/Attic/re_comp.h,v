@express final disapproval of the interfaces in libcompat, such as
them ftime(), gtty(), stty(), re_comp(), cuserid() and others.
Discussion and ongoing work to fix the ports tree from many, especially
naddy.
ok naddy
[There is a bit more cleanup possible after that, but this is considered
the current safe step]

@First pass at removing clauses 3 and 4 from NetBSD licenses.

Not sure what's more surprising: how long it took for NetBSD to
catch up to the rest of the BSDs (including UCB), or the amount of
code that NetBSD has claimed for itself without attributing to the
actual authors.

@Part one of userland __P removal.  Done with a simple regexp with some minor hand editing to make comments line up correctly.  Another pass is forthcoming that handles the cases that could not be done automatically.

@Well, as we are heading for a release people are encouraged to rebuild their
entire trees for testing anyway, I might as well do this intrusive touching
of include files now.  Added openBSD tags.
