@Part one of userland __P removal.  Done with a simple regexp with some minor hand editing to make comments line up correctly.  Another pass is forthcoming that handles the cases that could not be done automatically.

@ o Minor changes from db.1.86 (sleepycat).  Does not include the new hash
   routines since they cannot read a hashed .db file from the old code.
   Most of these files just have their RCS/SCCS tags standardized.
   Note that mpool.3 has not been updated to reflect the new mpool interface.
 o Add a real dbm(3) manpage
