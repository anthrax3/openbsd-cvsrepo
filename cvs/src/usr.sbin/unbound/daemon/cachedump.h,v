/**
 * \file
 *
 * This file contains functions to read and write the cache(s)
 * to text format.
 *
 * The format of the file is as follows:
 * [RRset cache]
 * [Message cache]
 * EOF		-- fixed string "EOF" before end of the file.
 *
 * The RRset cache is:
 * START_RRSET_CACHE
 * [rrset]*
 * END_RRSET_CACHE
 *
 * rrset is:
 * ;rrset [nsec_apex] TTL rr_count rrsig_count trust security
 * resource records, one per line, in zonefile format
 * rrsig records, one per line, in zonefile format
 * If the text conversion fails, BADRR is printed on the line.
 *
 * The Message cache is:
 * START_MSG_CACHE
 * [msg]*
 * END_MSG_CACHE
 *
 * msg is:
 * msg name class type flags qdcount ttl security an ns ar
 * list of rrset references, one per line. If conversion fails, BADREF
 * reference is:
 * name class type flags
 *
 * Expired cache entries are not printed.
