@Welcome eigrpd

The eigrpd daemon will support the Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol.

Built using the imsg/three process framework and heavily based on ospfd(8), ospf6d(8) and ldpd(8).

The current status of eigrpd(8) is as follows:
* Almost full compliance with the specification: DUAL FSM, RTP, CR mode, SIA, etc
* Support for both IPv4 and IPv6
* Support for multiple instances (different ASes/AFs) within the same process
* Support for rdomains (one process per rdomain)
* RIB/FIB synchronization
* Basic redistribution support

Not implemented features (yet):
* Configuration reload support (partially implemented)
* Route summarization
* Advanced route redistribution/filtering
* Carp integration
* Authentication (draft is missing information)
* Stub (not released by Cisco)

Not yet connected to the builds.
