.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is an Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol
.Pq EIGRP
daemon which manages routing tables.
EIGRP is a routing protocol based on Distance Vector technology.
.Pp
.Nm
is usually started at boot time, and can be enabled by
setting the following in
.Pa /etc/rc.conf.local :
.Pp
.Dl eigrpd_flags=\&"\&"
.Pp
See
.Xr rc 8
and
.Xr rc.conf 8
for more information on the boot process
and enabling daemons.
.Pp
A running
.Nm
can be controlled with the
.Xr eigrpctl 8
utility.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl D Ar macro Ns = Ns Ar value
Define
.Ar macro
to be set to
.Ar value
on the command line.
Overrides the definition of
.Ar macro
in the configuration file.
.It Fl d
Do not daemonize.
If this option is specified,
.Nm
will run in the foreground and log to
.Em stderr .
.It Fl f Ar file
Specify an alternative configuration file.
.It Fl n
Configtest mode.
Only check the configuration file for validity.
.It Fl s Ar socket
Use an alternate location for the default control socket.
.It Fl v
Produce more verbose output.

1.1
log
@Welcome eigrpd

The eigrpd daemon will support the Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol.

Built using the imsg/three process framework and heavily based on ospfd(8), ospf6d(8) and ldpd(8).

The current status of eigrpd(8) is as follows:
* Almost full compliance with the specification: DUAL FSM, RTP, CR mode, SIA, etc
* Support for both IPv4 and IPv6
* Support for multiple instances (different ASes/AFs) within the same process
* Support for rdomains (one process per rdomain)
* RIB/FIB synchronization
* Basic redistribution support

Not implemented features (yet):
* Configuration reload support (partially implemented)
* Route summarization
* Advanced route redistribution/filtering
* Carp integration
* Authentication (draft is missing information)
* Stub (not released by Cisco)

Not yet connected to the builds.
