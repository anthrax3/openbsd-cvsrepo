.Sh NAME
.Nm watchdogd
.Nd watchdog timer retrigger daemon
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm watchdogd
.Op Fl dnq
.Op Fl i Ar interval
.Op Fl p Ar period
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a daemon to activate and periodically retrigger the
.Xr watchdog 4
timer device from userland.
.Nm
is designed to work in high load environments,
where other methods
(such as a shell script invoking
.Xr sysctl 8 )
would involve too much overhead.
.Pp
The basic premise is that
after every
.Ar interval
seconds,
.Nm
resets the hardware timer to
.Ar period .
See also
.Xr watchdog 4
for more information on how watchdog timers work.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl d
Do not daemonize.
If this option is specified,
.Nm
will run in the foreground.
.It Fl i Ar interval
Specify how often, in seconds,
.Nm
should retrigger the hardware timer.
If no interval is specified,
the value of
.Ar period
(see below)
divided by three is used.
.It Fl n
Do not restore the watchdog to its original values once it has been activated.
With this set, the system will be rebooted by the watchdog even after a
.Xr halt 8 .
.It Fl p Ar period
Set the hardware timer to expire in
.Ar period
seconds.
The default is 30 seconds.
.It Fl q
Be quiet.
With this option specified,
.Nm
will not output a warning message if the underlying hardware adjusted the
timeout period.
.El

.Nm
program
first appeared in
.Ox 3.8 .

@Let watchdogd use the new watchdog(4) semantics.  When the new option -n
(no restore) is specified, the watchdog will not be restored to it's
original values when watchdogd terminates.

that means, when watchdogd is run with -n and you 'halt' the system, the
watchdog hardware will reset it.  which is wanted when the machine is
remote and the system shuts down unplanned.

is a daemon to periodically retrigger the watchdog timer device from
userland.  The watchdog timeout period and the retrigger
interval can be specified on the command line.  The period defaults to
30 seconds.  If no interval is specified, the value of the period divided
by three is used.  The daemon will detach from the controlling terminal
and run in the background unless the
