log
@man pages with pseudo synopses which list filenames end up creating
very ugly output in man -k; after some discussion with ingo, we feel
the simplest fix is to remove such SYNOPSIS sections: the info is hardly
helpful at page top, is contained already in FILES, and there are
sufficiently few that just zapping them is simple;

ok schwarze, who also helpfully ran things through a build to check
output;

.Dt BOOTPARAMS 5
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm bootparams
.Nd boot parameter database
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm bootparams
file specifies the boot parameters that
.Xr diskless 8
clients may request when booting over the network.
Each client supported by this server must have an entry in the
.Nm bootparams
file containing the pathnames for its "root" and (optionally) "swap" areas.
.Pp
Each line in the file
(other than comment lines that begin with a
.Sq # )
specifies the client name followed by the pathnames that
the client may request by their logical names.
The components of the line are delimited with blank or tab,
and may be continued onto multiple lines with a backslash.
.Pp
For example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
client	root=server:/export/client/root \e
	swap=server:/export/client/swap \e
	dump=server:/export/client/swap
.Ed
.Pp
When the client named "client" requests the pathname for
its logical "root" it will be given the server name "server"
and the pathname
.Pa /export/client/root
as the response to its
.Tn RPC
request.
.Pp
A line containing simply
.Sq +
will cause YP lookups to be done on the YP map "bootparams".
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /etc/bootparams -compact

default configuration file
