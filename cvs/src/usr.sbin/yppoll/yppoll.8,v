@First pass at removing clauses 3 and 4 from NetBSD licenses.

Not sure what's more surprising: how long it took for NetBSD to
catch up to the rest of the BSDs (including UCB), or the amount of
code that NetBSD has claimed for itself without attributing to the
actual authors.

@Change all option list specifications to ".Bl -tag -width Ds". Most man
pages just needed their -width parameter tweaked to "Ds", which provides
a nice width of 6 constant characters. For consistency more than anything.
