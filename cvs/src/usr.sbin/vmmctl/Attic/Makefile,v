log
@Change the command line syntax to a "command + getopts" style, eg.
  vmmctl start "myvm" -m 512M -i 1 -d disk.img -k /bsd

Networking people like me are used to the human-readable CLI-style
syntax that we have in some of our OpenBSD *ctl tools, including
bgpctl, other routing daemons, or relayctl.  But this didn't work for
vmmctl, so change it to something a bit less human-readable but more
BSD- and POSIX-ish.  After all, the command line is only intended for
simple configuration, more details will go into the configuration
file, so we can avoid getopt flag conflicts or scary things like the
getsubopt(3) style.

OK krw@@ jasper@@, with input from kettenis@@ jmc@@ deraadt@@ mlarkin@@ etc.

1.2
log
@Add initial parser to support a vmm.conf(5) configuration file format
for vmm and virtual machines.  Additionally, add a matching vmmctl
command line grammar that replaces (most of the) getopt arguments.
The goal is to provide a sane way to configure vmm(4) and vmd(8).
"There is still a lot to be done, and fixed" in this as well.

@
vmmctl(8) - vmm subsystem control

There is still a lot to be done, and fixed, in these userland components
but I have received enough "it works, commit it" emails that it's time
to finish those things in tree.

discussed with many, tested by many.
