.Dt VMM.CONF 5
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm vmm.conf
.Nd virtual machine configuration
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is the configuration file to configure the virtual machine monitor
(VMM) subsystem.
A VMM manages virtual machines (VMs) on a
.Ar host .
The VMM subsystem is responsible for creating, destroying, and
executing VMs.
.Sh SECTIONS
.Nm
is divided into three main sections:
.Bl -tag -width xxxx
.It Sy Macros
User-defined variables may be defined and used later, simplifying the
configuration file.
.It Sy VM Configuration
Configuration for each individual virtual machine.
.El
.Pp
Within the sections,
the
.Ar bytes
argument can be specified with a human-readable scale,
using the format described in
.Xr scan_scaled 3 .
.Pp
The current line can be extended over multiple lines using a backslash
.Pq Sq \e .
Comments can be put anywhere in the file using a hash mark
.Pq Sq # ,
and extend to the end of the current line.
Care should be taken when commenting out multi-line text:
the comment is effective until the end of the entire block.
.Pp
Argument names not beginning with a letter, digit, or underscore
must be quoted.
.Pp
Additional configuration files can be included with the
.Ic include
keyword, for example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
include "/etc/vm1.example.com.conf"
.Ed
.Sh MACROS
Macros can be defined that will later be expanded in context.
Macro names must start with a letter, digit, or underscore,
and may contain any of those characters.
Macro names may not be reserved words (for example,
.Ic vm ,
.Ic memory ,
or
.Ic disk ) .
Macros are not expanded inside quotes.
.Pp
For example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
ramdisk="/bsd.rd"
vm "vm1.example.com" {
	memory 512M
	kernel $ramdisk
}
.Ed
.Sh VM CONFIGURATION
Each
.Ic vm
section starts with a declaration of the virtual machine
.Ar name :
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ic vm Ar name Brq ...
This name can be any string, and is typically a hostname.
.El
.Pp
Followed by a block of parameters that is enclosed in curly brackets:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Cm enable
Automatically start the VM.
This is the default if neither
.Cm enable
nor
.Cm disable
is specified.
.It Cm disable
Do not start this VM.
.It Cm disk Ar path
Disk image file (may be specified multiple times to add multiple disk images).
.It Cm kernel Ar path
Kernel to load when booting the VM.
.It Cm memory Ar bytes
Memory size of the VM, in bytes, rounded to megabytes.
.It Cm interfaces Ar count
Number of network interfaces to add to the VM.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
Create a new VM with 512MB memory, 1 network interface, one disk image
('disk.img') and boot from kernel '/bsd':
.Bd -literal -offset indent
vm "vm2.example.com" {
	memory 512M
	interfaces 1
	disk "/var/vmm/vm2-disk.img"
	kernel "/bsd"
}
.Ed
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr vmm 4 ,
.Xr vmd 8 ,
.Xr vmmctl 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
file format first appeared in
.Ox 5.9 .
.Sh AUTHORS

1.7
log
@Change the command line syntax to a "command + getopts" style, eg.
  vmmctl start "myvm" -m 512M -i 1 -d disk.img -k /bsd

Networking people like me are used to the human-readable CLI-style
syntax that we have in some of our OpenBSD *ctl tools, including
bgpctl, other routing daemons, or relayctl.  But this didn't work for
vmmctl, so change it to something a bit less human-readable but more
BSD- and POSIX-ish.  After all, the command line is only intended for
simple configuration, more details will go into the configuration
file, so we can avoid getopt flag conflicts or scary things like the
getsubopt(3) style.

@Automatically start vmm(4) when the first VM is created and after the
last VM is terminated.  This allows to remove the explicit "vmm
enable" / "vmm disable" (VMM_IOC_START / VMM_IOC_STOP) ioctls.  You'll
have to update kernel and userland for this change, as the kernel ABI
changes.

Global settings for the

.Sh VMM CONFIGURATION
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Cm vmm disable
Disable the VMM subsystem.
Virtual machines running on the host should be terminated first.
.It Cm vmm enable
Enable the VMM subsystem.
The VMM subsystem must be enabled before VMs can be managed on the host.
.El
.Pp
Generally, the
.Nm
utility is run with
.Cm enable
option during system startup to enable the VMM subsystem on boot.
This can be automated via the
.Xr rc 8
and
.Xr rc.conf 8
facilities used during system startup.

log
@Add initial parser to support a vmm.conf(5) configuration file format
for vmm and virtual machines.  Additionally, add a matching vmmctl
command line grammar that replaces (most of the) getopt arguments.
The goal is to provide a sane way to configure vmm(4) and vmd(8).
"There is still a lot to be done, and fixed" in this as well.
