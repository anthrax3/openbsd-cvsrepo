@use <limits.h> comprehensively.  For now try to push <> includes to
each .c file, and out of the .h files.  To avoid overinclude.
ok gilles, in principle.  If this has been done right, -portable should
become easier to maintain.

@Sync with our smtpd repo:

* first bricks of ldap and sqlite support (not finished but both working)
* new table API to replace map API, all lookups are done through tables
* improved handling of temporary errors throughout the daemon
* improved scheduler and mta logic: connection reuse, optimizes batches
* improved queue: more tolerant to admin errors, new layout, less disk-IO
* improved memory usage under high load
* SSL certs/keys isolated to lookup process to avoid facing network
* VIRTUAL support improved, fully virtual setups possible now
* runtime tracing of processes through smtpctl trace
* ssl_privsep.c sync-ed with relayd
* ssl.c no longer contains smtpd specific interfaces
* smtpd-specific ssl bits moved to ssl_smtpd.c
* update mail address in copyright

FLUSH YOUR QUEUE. FLUSH YOUR QUEUE. FLUSH YOUR QUEUE. FLUSH YOUR QUEUE.

smtpd.conf(5) simplified, it will require adaptations

@Import generic network IO code.  The plan is to hide the boring
details of IO operations such as buffering or SSL, and provide a
slightly nicer interface to the protocol writer.

Not plugged to the rest of the code yet.
