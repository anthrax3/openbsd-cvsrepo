log
@Sync with our smtpd repo:

* first bricks of ldap and sqlite support (not finished but both working)
* new table API to replace map API, all lookups are done through tables
* improved handling of temporary errors throughout the daemon
* improved scheduler and mta logic: connection reuse, optimizes batches
* improved queue: more tolerant to admin errors, new layout, less disk-IO
* improved memory usage under high load
* SSL certs/keys isolated to lookup process to avoid facing network
* VIRTUAL support improved, fully virtual setups possible now
* runtime tracing of processes through smtpctl trace
* ssl_privsep.c sync-ed with relayd
* ssl.c no longer contains smtpd specific interfaces
* smtpd-specific ssl bits moved to ssl_smtpd.c
* update mail address in copyright

FLUSH YOUR QUEUE. FLUSH YOUR QUEUE. FLUSH YOUR QUEUE. FLUSH YOUR QUEUE.

smtpd.conf(5) simplified, it will require adaptations

1.1
log
@- change callback prototypes in filter.c to allow stricter checks
- introduce STATUS_WAITING, filters will reroute async DNS queries through
  LKA in a near future
- filter_api.c will contain our filter API (empty for now)
- Makefile to build libsmtpdfilter (not linked to the build,dev stuff only)
