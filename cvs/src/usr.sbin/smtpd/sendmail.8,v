.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl tv
.Op Fl F Ar name
.Op Fl f Ar from
.Ar to ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility is a local enqueuer for the
.Xr smtpd 8
daemon,
compatible with
.Xr mailwrapper 8 .
The message is read on standard input (stdin) until
.Nm
encounters an end-of-file.
The
.Nm
enqueuer is not intended to be used directly to send mail,
but rather via a frontend known as a mail user agent.
.Pp
Unless the optional
.Fl t
flag is specified,
one or more recipients must be specified on the command line.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl F Ar name
Set the sender's full name.
.It Fl f Ar from
Set the sender's address.
.It Fl t
Read the message's To:, Cc:, and Bcc: fields for recipients.
The Bcc: field will be deleted before sending.
.It Fl v
Enable verbose output.
.El
.Pp
To maintain compatibility with Sendmail, Inc.'s implementation of
.Nm ,
various other flags are accepted,
but have no effect.
