@add a (high) limit to the number of header lines we're willing to keep in
memory for rewriting purposes, this will prevent sessions from sending an
insanely large number of continuations to a single header and starve us.

log
@to rewrite domain on incoming mails, we need to be able to extract
rfc822 addresses from some headers and parse them into a structure
that we can easily manipulate.

this implementation will parse addresses in the following formats:
	user, user <addr>, "user" <addr>, "user name" <addr>
