.Nd format description for smtpd passwd tables
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents the file format of "passwd" tables used by the
.Xr smtpd 8
mail daemon.
.Pp
The format described here applies to tables as defined in
.Xr smtpd.conf 5 .
.Sh PASSWD TABLE
A "passwd" table stores information regarding local users.
The information is encoded using the traditional
.Xr passwd 5
format and allows the sharing of a user database across different software
supporting this format.
.Pp
The table is used by
.Xr smtpd 8
when authenticating a user or when user information such as user-id or
home directory is required for a delivery.
.Pp
A "passwd" table consists of a flat file containing the user entries, each
one on a line by itself, with fields separated by a colon:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
gilles:*:1000:1000:Gilles:/home/gilles:/sbin/nologin
eric:*:1001:1001:Eric:/home/eric:/sbin/nologin
chl:*:1002:1002:Charles:/home/chl:/sbin/nologin
.Ed
.Pp
If the table is used for authentication, the second field may contain a
password encrypted using the
.Xr crypt 3
function.
Such passwords can be generated using the
.Xr encrypt 1
utility or
.Xr smtpctl 8
encrypt command.
