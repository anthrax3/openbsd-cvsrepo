/*
**  SMRSH -- sendmail restricted shell
**
**	This is a patch to get around the prog mailer bugs in most
**	versions of sendmail.
**
**	Use this in place of /bin/sh in the "prog" mailer definition
**	in your sendmail.cf file.  You then create CMDDIR (owned by
**	root, mode 755) and put links to any programs you want
**	available to prog mailers in that directory.  This should
**	include things like "vacation" and "procmail", but not "sed"
**	or "sh".
**
**	Leading pathnames are stripped from program names so that
**	existing .forward files that reference things like
**	"/usr/ucb/vacation" will continue to work.
**
**	The following characters are completely illegal:
**		<  >  |  ^  ;  &  $  `  (  ) \n \r
**	This is more restrictive than strictly necessary.
**
**	To use this, edit /etc/sendmail.cf, search for ^Mprog, and
**	change P=/bin/sh to P=/usr/local/etc/smrsh, where this compiled
**	binary is installed /usr/local/etc/smrsh.
**
**	This can be used on any version of sendmail.
**
**	In loving memory of RTM.  11/02/93.

@Update to Sendmail 8.8.4, plus recent patches, plus OpenBSD support.
Also include entire example configuration subset.
Includes smrsh (using /usr/libexec/sm.bin).

Of the top of my head, the only things I removed from the distribution were
contrib/mail.local.linux, src/Makefiles, all the *.0 and *.ps files.
Our praliases man page replaces the distributed one, ours is better.
