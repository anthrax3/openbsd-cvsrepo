#
# Notes:
# - SGI's /etc/sendmail.cf defines also 'u' for local mailer flags -- you
#   perhaps don't want it.
# - Perhaps is should also add define(`LOCAL_MAILER_CHARSET', iso-8859-1)
#   put some Asian sites may prefer otherwise -- or perhaps not.
# - SGI's /etc/sendmail.cf seems use: A=mail -s -d $u
#   It seems work without that -s however.
# - SGI's /etc/sendmail.cf set's default uid and gid to 998 (guest)
# - In SGI seems that TZ variable is needed that correct time is marked to
#   syslog
# - helpfile is in /etc/sendmail.hf in SGI's /etc/sendmail.cf
