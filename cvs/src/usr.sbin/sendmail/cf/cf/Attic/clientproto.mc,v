#  addresses to be sent unqualified via the SMTP connection; normally
#  they are qualifed with the masquerade name, which defaults to the
#  name of the hub machine.
#  Other than these, it should never contain any other lines.

@Update to Sendmail 8.8.4, plus recent patches, plus OpenBSD support.
Also include entire example configuration subset.
Includes smrsh (using /usr/libexec/sm.bin).

Of the top of my head, the only things I removed from the distribution were
contrib/mail.local.linux, src/Makefiles, all the *.0 and *.ps files.
Our praliases man page replaces the distributed one, ours is better.
