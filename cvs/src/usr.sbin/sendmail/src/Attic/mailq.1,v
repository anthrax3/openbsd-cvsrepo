.Sh NAME
.Nm mailq

.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm mailq
.Op Fl v
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Mailq
prints a summary of the mail messages queued for future delivery.
.Pp
The first line printed for each message
shows the internal identifier used on this host
for the message,
the size of the message in bytes,
the date and time the message was accepted into the queue,
and the envelope sender of the message.
The second line shows the error message that caused this message
to be retained in the queue;
it will not be present if the message is being processed
for the first time.
The following lines show message recipients,
one per line.
.Pp
.Nm Mailq
is identical to
.Dq Li "sendmail -bp" .
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl v
Print verbose information.
This adds the priority of the message and
a single character indicator (``+'' or blank)
indicating whether a warning message has been sent
on the first line of the message.
Additionally, extra lines may be intermixed with the recipients
indicating the ``controlling user'' information;
this shows who will own any programs that are executed
on behalf of this message
and the name of the alias this command expanded from, if any.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm mailq
utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr mailer.conf 5 ,
.Xr sendmail 8
.Sh HISTORY
