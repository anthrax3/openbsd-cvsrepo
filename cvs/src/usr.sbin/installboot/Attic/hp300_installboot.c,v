@Retire hp300, mvme68k and mvme88k ports. These ports have no users, keeping
this hardware alive is becoming increasingly difficult, and I should heed the
message sent by the three disks which have died on me over the last few days.

Noone sane will mourn these ports anyway. So long, and thanks for the fish.

@Rework installboot and use a single directory with a single makefile. The
directory per machine model is arguably cleaner, however it does not play
well with distrib/special and instbin.
