@Rework installboot and use a single directory with a single makefile. The
directory per machine model is arguably cleaner, however it does not play
well with distrib/special and instbin.

log
@Instead of playing #include games to get a 32-bit ELF implementation on
amd64, simply compile in our own nlist_elf32. Remove ECOFF and AOUT from
the nlist implementation since we do not need it.

This makes the code identical for the i386 and amd64 versions of
installboot(8).

1.1
log
@Initial version of a unified installboot(8) that lives outside of
sys/arch/${MACHINE}/stand. For now this only supports i386, however
additional architectures will be added and further development can happen
in tree.

Requested by deraadt@@ quite some time ago.
