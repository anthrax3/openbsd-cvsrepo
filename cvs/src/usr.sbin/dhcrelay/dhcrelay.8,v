.Sh NAME
.Nm dhcrelay
.Nd Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol relay agent
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl dor
.Op Fl C Ar circuit-id
.Op Fl R Ar remote-id
.Fl i Ar interface
.Ar destination ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility provides a means for relaying DHCP and BOOTP requests from a subnet
to which no DHCP server is directly connected to one or more DHCP servers on
other subnets.
.Pp
.Nm
listens for DHCP requests on a given interface.
When a query is received,
.Nm
forwards it to the list of DHCP destinations specified on the command line.
When a reply is received, it is broadcast or unicast on the network from
whence the original request came.
.Pp
The server might be a name, address or interface.
.Nm
will operate in layer 2 mode when the specified servers are interfaces,
otherwise it will operate in layer 3 mode.
.Pp
The name of at least one DHCP server to which DHCP and BOOTP requests
should be relayed,
as well as the name of the network interface that
.Nm
should attempt to configure,
must be specified on the command line.
.Pp
.Nm
supports relaying of DHCP traffic to configure IPsec tunnel mode
clients when listening on the
.Xr enc 4
interface using layer 3 mode only.
The DHCP server has to support RFC 3046 to echo back the relay agent
information to allow stateless DHCP reply to IPsec tunnel mapping.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl C Ar circuit-id
The
.Ar circuit-id
relay agent information sub-option value that
.Nm
should append on relayed packets.
If this option is not specified it will use the interface number by default.
.It Fl d
Do not daemonize.
If this option is specified,
.Nm
will run in the foreground and log to
.Em stderr .
.It Fl i Ar interface
The name of the network interface that
.Nm
should attempt to configure.
For layer 3 mode at least one IPv4 address has to be configured on this
interface.
.It Fl o
Add the relay agent information option.
By default, this is only enabled for the
.Xr enc 4
interface.
.It Fl R Ar remote-id
The
.Ar remote-id
relay agent information sub-option value that
.Nm
should append on relayed packets.
If this option is not specified it will use the destination address by default.
.It Fl r
Replace incoming Relay Agent Information with the one configured.

.Sh BUGS
Relayed DHCP traffic could actually safely be protected by IPsec but,
like
.Xr dhcpd 8
and
.Xr dhclient 8 ,
.Nm
will bypass IPsec for all its traffic.

@Add support for "DHCP-over-IPsec" by implementing RFC 3046 (DHCP Relay
Agent Information Option) and RFC 3456 (DHCP Configuration of IPsec
Tunnel Mode).  This allows to configure various IPsec clients
dynamically via DHCP; dhcrelay needs to listen on enc0 and forward
requests to a DHCP server that supports RFC 3046, like I recently did
for dhcpd(8).

Tells

to listen and transmit on a port other than the standard

It should be followed by the UDP port number that
.Nm
should use.
This is mostly useful for debugging purposes.
The relay agent will transmit responses to clients
at a port number that is one greater than the one specified \- i.e., if
you specify
.Fl p
67, then the relay agent will listen on port 67 and transmit to port 68.
Transmissions to servers will be sent to the same port number
that is specified with the
.Fl p
flag.

The Internet Software Consortium DHCP Relay Agent,
.Nm dhcrelay ,
provides a means for relaying DHCP and BOOTP requests from a subnet to which
no DHCP server is directly connected to one or more DHCP servers on other
subnets.
d59 2
a60 3
The DHCP Relay Agent listens for DHCP requests on all interfaces
attached to a host, unless one or more interfaces are specified on the
command line with the
a69 9
It is possible to specify a set of interfaces on which
.Nm
will listen, so that if
.Nm
is connected through one interface to a network on which there is no DHCP
server, but is connected on another interface to a network on which there
is a DHCP server, it will not relay DHCP and BOOTP requests from the network
on which the server exists to that server.
This is an imperfect solution.

The names of the network interfaces that

should attempt to configure may be specified on the command line using the

If no interface names are specified on the command line,
.Nm
will identify all network interfaces, eliminating non-broadcast interfaces
if possible, and attempt to configure each interface.
a105 3
This is useful when running
.Nm
under a debugger, or when running it out of inittab on System V systems.
