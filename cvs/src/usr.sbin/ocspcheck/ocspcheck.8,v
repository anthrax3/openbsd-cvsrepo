.Dt OCSPCHECK 8
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm ocspcheck
.Nd check a certificate for validity against its OCSP responder
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl Nv
.Op Fl C Ar CAfile
.Op Fl o Ar staplefile
.Ar file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility validates a PEM format certificate against the OCSP responder
encoded in the certificate specified by the
.Ar file
argument.
Normally it should be used for checking server certificates
and maintaining saved OCSP responses to be used for OCSP stapling.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl C Ar CAfile
Specify a PEM format root certificate bundle to use for the validation of
requests.
By default no certificates are used beyond those in the
certificate chain provided by the
.Ar file
argument.
.It Fl N
Do not use a nonce value in the OCSP request, or validate that the
nonce was returned in the OCSP response.
By default a nonce is always used and validated.
The use of this flag is a security risk as it will allow OCSP
responses to be replayed.
It should not be used unless the OCSP server does not support the
use of OCSP nonces.
.It Fl o Ar staplefile
Specify an output filename where the DER encoded response from the
OCSP server will be written, if the OCSP response validates.
A filename
of
.Sq -
will write the response to standard output.
By default the response is not saved.
.It Fl v
Increase verbosity.
This flag may be specified multiple times to get more verbose output.
The default behaviour is to be silent unless something goes wrong.
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
The
.Nm
utility exits 0 if the OCSP response validates for the certificate in
.Ar file
and all output is successfully written out.
.Nm
exits >0 if an error occurs or the OCSP response fails to validate.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr nc 1 ,
.Xr tls_config_set_ocsp_staple_file 3 ,
.Xr tls_config_set_ocsp_staple_mem 3 ,
.Xr httpd 8
.Sh AUTHORS
.Nm
was written by
.An Bob Beck .
.Sh CAVEATS
While
.Nm
could possibly be used in scripts to query responders for server
certificates seen on client connections, this is almost always a bad
idea.
God kills a kitten every time you make an OCSP query from the
client side of a TLS connection.
.Sh BUGS
.Nm
will create the output file if it does not exist.
On failure a newly created output file will not be removed.
