/*
 * Data structures for recording monitored hosts
 *
 * The information held by the status monitor comprises a list of hosts
 * that we have been asked to monitor, and, associated with each monitored
 * host, one or more clients to be called back if the monitored host crashes.
 *
 * The list of monitored hosts must be retained over a crash, so that upon
 * re-boot we can call the SM_NOTIFY procedure in all those hosts so as to
 * cause them to start recovery processing.  On the other hand, the client
 * call-backs are not required to be preserved: they are assumed (in the
 * protocol design) to be local processes which will have crashed when
 * we did, and so are discarded on restart.
 *
 * We handle this by keeping the list of monitored hosts in a file
 * (/var/statd.state) which is mmap()ed and whose format is described
 * by the typedef Header.  The lists of client callbacks are chained
 * off this structure, but are held in normal memory and so will be
 * lost after a re-boot.  Hence the actual values of MonList * pointers
 * in the copy on disc have no significance, but their NULL/non-NULL
 * status indicates whether this host is actually being monitored or if it
 * is an empty slot in the file.
