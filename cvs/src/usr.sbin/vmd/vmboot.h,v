1.2
log
@Implement basic support for boot.conf(8) on the disk image.

Like the real boot loader, load and parse hd0a:/etc/boot.conf from the
first disk and fall back to /bsd.  Not all boot loader options are
supported, but it at least does set device, set image, and boot -acds
(eg. for booting single-user).

For example, it can now boot install60.fs that includes a boot.conf
with "set image /6.0/amd64/bsd.rd":
	vmctl start install -c -d install60.fs -d OpenBSD.img

This pseudo-bootloader is only needed without BIOS and could
potentially be replaced in the future.

1.1
log
@Add support for booting the kernel from the disk image.

This make the kernel/-k argument optional and, if not specified, tries
to find the /bsd kernel in the primary hd0a partition of the first
disk image itself.  It doesn't support hd0a:/etc/boot.conf yet, and it
is no BIOS or full boot loader, but it makes booting and handling of
VMs a bit easier - booting an external kernel is still supported.

The UFS file system code ufs.c is directly from libsa which is also
used by the real boot loader.  The code compiles with a few signedness
warning which will be fixed separately.
