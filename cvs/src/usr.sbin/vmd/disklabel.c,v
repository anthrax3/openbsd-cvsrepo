@Implement basic support for boot.conf(8) on the disk image.

Like the real boot loader, load and parse hd0a:/etc/boot.conf from the
first disk and fall back to /bsd.  Not all boot loader options are
supported, but it at least does set device, set image, and boot -acds
(eg. for booting single-user).

For example, it can now boot install60.fs that includes a boot.conf
with "set image /6.0/amd64/bsd.rd":
	vmctl start install -c -d install60.fs -d OpenBSD.img

This pseudo-bootloader is only needed without BIOS and could
potentially be replaced in the future.
