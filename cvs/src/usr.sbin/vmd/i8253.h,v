log
@Adds functions to read and write state of devices in vmd.

This is required for implementing vmctl send and vmctl receive.  vmctl
send / receive are two new options that will support snapshotting VMs
and migrating VMs from one host to another. The atomicio files are
copied from usr.bin/ssh.

Patch from Pratik Vyas; this project was undertaken at San Jose State
University along with his three teammates, Ashwin, Harshada and Siri
with mlarkin@@ as the advisor.

OK mlarkin@@

log
@Various i8253/i8254 implementation improvements - Fix an error that used
the wrong i/o latch index on reads (resulting in erratic counter values
possibly being read). Also do proper return size setting (don't clobber
%eax high bits).

This diff also implements counter readback mode, which is used in seabios.
