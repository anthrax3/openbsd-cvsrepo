@Adds functions to read and write state of devices in vmd.

This is required for implementing vmctl send and vmctl receive.  vmctl
send / receive are two new options that will support snapshotting VMs
and migrating VMs from one host to another. The atomicio files are
copied from usr.bin/ssh.

Patch from Pratik Vyas; this project was undertaken at San Jose State
University along with his three teammates, Ashwin, Harshada and Siri
with mlarkin@@ as the advisor.

@Implement memory size and SMP CPU count NVRAM registers in the emulated
mc146818. This is needed for seabios to boot properly (and construct
a sensible e820 map to send to the guest OS).
