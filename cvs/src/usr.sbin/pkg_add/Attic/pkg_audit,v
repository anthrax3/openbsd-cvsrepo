@synch with my new style search/location changes
It's likely there will be some fallout, but it's getting a bit too large
to keep around.
This does kill a few very old oddities as well.

@some minor systematic changes.
- mark all regexps I can with /o if they can be compiled once.
- turn $o->method() into $o->method
- remove unneeded prototypes
- reduce split /re/ into split "string" where possible.

@introduce shortcuts to read/write contents from_installation/to_installation

use these to simplify all those packing lists manipulations.

demote non-root detection to a warning in -n mode:
fix a couple of minor bugs, of stuff that was run in -n mode and should not.
Namely, manpages were indexed/unindexed (ouch) and tempfiles were creating
during updates.
