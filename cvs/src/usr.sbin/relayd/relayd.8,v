.Sh NAME
.Nm relayd
.Nd relay daemon
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl dnv
.Op Fl D Ar macro Ns = Ns Ar value
.Op Fl f Ar file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a daemon to relay and dynamically redirect incoming connections to
a target host.
Its main purposes are to run as a load-balancer, application layer
gateway, or transparent proxy.
The daemon is able to monitor groups of hosts for availability, which
is determined by checking for a specific service common to a host
group.
When availability is confirmed,
layer 3 and/or layer 7 forwarding services are set up by
.Nm .
.Pp
Layer 3 redirection happens at the packet level; to configure
it,
.Nm
communicates with
.Xr pf 4 .
To allow
.Nm
to properly set up
.Xr pf 4
rules, the following line is required in the filter section of
.Xr pf.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
anchor "relayd/*"
.Ed
.Pp
Layer 7 relaying happens at the application level and is
handled by
.Nm
itself.
Various application level filtering and protocol-specific
load-balancing options are available for relays.
.Pp
.Nm
works in terms of the following
.Em entities :
relays, protocols, redirections, and tables.
A
.Em relay
represents a layer 7 load-balancing instance.
Each instance translates to a listening TCP or UDP port.
A
.Em protocol
defines which actions, if any, are taken on the
packet payload as data crosses a relay.
A
.Em redirection
represents a layer 3 load-balancing instance.
Each instance translates to a
.Xr pf 4
rdr-to rule being added.
A
.Em table
represents a group of hosts which can be checked for
availability using the same method.
Each table contains at least one host.
If a table is used in a layer 3 load-balancing instance, it
will be mapped to a
.Xr pf 4
table containing only those hosts which are up.
.Pp
All these entities can be configured in
.Xr relayd.conf 5 ,
and
.Xr relayctl 8
can be used to alter or report on the status of each entity.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl D Ar macro Ns = Ns Ar value
Define
.Ar macro
to be set to
.Ar value
on the command line.
Overrides the definition of
.Ar macro
in the configuration file.
.It Fl d
Do not daemonize.
If this option is specified,
.Nm
will run in the foreground and log to
.Em stderr .
.It Fl f Ar file
Specify an alternative configuration file.
The default is
.Pa /etc/relayd.conf .
.It Fl n
Configtest mode.
Only check the configuration file for validity.
.It Fl v
Produce more verbose output.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width "/var/run/relayd.sockXX" -compact
.It Pa /etc/relayd.conf
Default configuration file.
.It Pa /var/run/relayd.sock
.Ux Ns -domain
socket used for communication with
.Xr relayctl 8 .

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
program, formerly known as
.Ic hoststated ,
first appeared in
.Ox 4.1 .
It was renamed to

@add an alternative "route to" mode to relayd redirections which maps
to pf route-to instead of the default rdr. it is a first steps towards
support for "direct server return" (dsr), an asynchronous mode where
the load balanced servers send the replies to a different gateway like
a l3 switch/router to handle higher amounts of return traffic.
because the state handling in pf isn't optimal for this case yet, it
just sees half of the TCP connection, the sessions are forced to time
out after fixed number of seconds.

the tables will look more like pf tables, it is easier to re-use
tables with different options, "services" will become "redirections"
(they refer to rdr pf rules), sync configuration directives of
redirect (l3, ex-service) relay (l7) sections (for example "virtual

"forward to", etc. pp. (see relay.conf(5) and etc/relayd.conf)

Each table contains at least one host, and is mapped to a pf table.

by the content of another table when it is empty.
This can be used to serve static content when a dynamic service goes down.

@Import hostated, the host status daemon.  This daemon will monitor
remote hosts and dynamically alter pf(4) tables and redirection rules
for active server load balancing.  The daemon has been written by
Pierre-Yves Ritschard (pyr at spootnik.org) and was formerly known as
"slbd".

The daemon is fully functional but it still needs some work and
cleanup so we don't link it to the build yet.  Some TODOs are a
partial rewrite of the check_* routines (use libevent whenever we
can), improvement of the manpages, and general knf and cleanup.
