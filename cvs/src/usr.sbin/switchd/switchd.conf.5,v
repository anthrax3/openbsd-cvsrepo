.Sh NAME
.Nm switchd.conf
.Nd switch daemon configuration file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is the configuration file for the switch daemon,
.Xr switchd 8 .
.Sh SECTIONS
.Nm
files is divided into two main sections:
.Bl -tag -width xxxx
.It Sy Macros
User-defined variables may be defined and user later, simplifying the
configuration file.
.It Sy Global Configuration
Global runtime settings for
.Xr switchd 8 .
.El
.Pp
The current line can be extended over multiple lines using a backslash
.Pq Sq \e .
Comments can be put anywhere in the file using a hash mark
.Pq Sq # ,
and extend to the end of the current line.
Care should be taken when commenting out multi-line text:
the comment is effective until the end of the entire block.
.Pp
Argument names not beginning with a letter, digit, or underscore
must be quoted.
.Pp
Additional configuration files can be included with the
.Ic include
keyword, for example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
include "/etc/switchd.conf.local"
.Ed
.Sh MACROS
Macros can be defined that will later be expanded in context.
Macro names must start with a letter, digit, or underscore,
and may contain any of those characters.
Macro names may not be reserved words (for example,
.Ic directory ,
.Ic log ,
or
.Ic root ) .
Macros are not expanded inside quotes.
.Pp
For example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
ext_ip="10.0.0.1"
listen on $ext_ip
.Ed
.Sh GLOBAL CONFIGURATION
The following options can be set globally:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ic listen on Ar address Oo Ic tls Oc Op Ic port Ar port
Set the listen address and port to accept connections from remote
OpenFlow switches.
Secure connections can be enabled with the optional
.Ic tls
keyword.
.\".It Ic device on Ar device-name Oo Ic forward to Ar uri Oc
.\"Attach to a
.\".Xr switch 4
.\"device.
.\"When attached,
.\".Xr switchd 8
.\"will accept OpenFlow messages from the connected kernel interface.
.\"The daemon either handles the requests locally or sends them to a remote
.\"controller if the
.\".Ic forward to
.\"directive is set.
.\"The
.\".Ar uri
.\"is the method and address to connect to the remote controller,
.\"with the format
.\".Ar protocol:address:port
.\"where the
.\".Ar protocol
.\"can be either
.\".Dq tcp
.\"or
.\".Dq tls .
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following example is a typical one.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
listen on 0.0.0.0 port 6633
.\"device "/dev/switch0"
.\"device "/dev/switch1" forward to tcp:192.168.0.1:6633

@Import switchd(8), a basic WIP OpenFlow implementation for OpenBSD.

switchd consists of two parts:
1. switchd(8) and switchctl(8), an OpenFlow controller or "vswitch".
2. switch(4), an OpenFlow-aware kernel "bridge".

This the 1st part, the driver will be imported later.  The code will
remain disabled for a while, but it helps development to have it in
the tree.  switchd currently supports partial OpenFlow 1.0, but the
goal is to use OpenFlow 1.3.5 instead (switch(4) already does 1.3.5).

For more background information see:

Attach to a

device.
When attached,
.Xr switchd 8
will accept OpenFlow messages from the connected kernel interface.
The daemon either handles the requests locally or sends them to a remote
controller if the
.Ic forward to
directive is set.
The
.Ar uri
is the method and address to connect to the remote controller,
with the format
.Ar protocol:address:port
where the
.Ar protocol
can be either
.Dq tcp
or
.Dq tls .
