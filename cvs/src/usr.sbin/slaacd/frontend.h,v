@Add slaacd, a Stateless Address AutoConfiguration Daemon.

Based on krw's newd effort where he did all the heavy lifting to
extract a generic OpenBSD-style privsep daemon out of all the existing
daemons in tree.

It's at a point now where it makes sense to work on it in tree.

Sounds good to deraadt@@
