.Sh NAME
.Nm pcmciad
.Nd PC-CARD slot monitor daemon
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm pcmciad
.Op Fl d
.Op Fl q
.Op Fl c Ar conf-file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
monitors a set of PCMCIA slots for card change events, and acts on those
events.
It reads the configuration file specified with the
.Fl c
flag, or, if no file is specified, the default configuration file
.Pa /etc/pcmciad.conf .
.Pp
Each line of the configuration file contains a list of PCMCIA slot
device files to monitor and a command name for that slot.
Whenever a card event occurs on a monitored slot,
.Nm
attempts to
configure (upon insertion) or unconfigure (upon removal) the card.  If
the action succeeds, the slot's command is run, passed the slot number,
event type (insert or delete), and device type name.
.Pp
.Nm
announces card insertion/configuration/removal events on the speaker
(using the
.Pa /dev/speaker
device).  A short high note announces a card insertion.  A low note
followed by a high note indicates successful card configuration; a
single low note indicates an unknown card or configuration failure.  A
high note followed by a low note indicates a card removal.
.Pp
When the
.Fl q
flag is specified, the card insertion/removal events are not announced
on the speaker.
