@Welcome ospf6d

The new ospf6d daemon will support OSPFv3, basically OSPF for IPv6 networks.

It is heavily based on ospfd(8), it is more or less a copy and paste of it.
Currently some unneeded stuff has been removed and the trasition from
IPv4 to IPv6 has begun.

ospf6d is not very usefull at the moment, it is being imported to allow more
people to work on it concurrently.

Not yet connected to the builds.
