.Dt OSPF6D.CONF 5
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm ospf6d.conf
.Nd Open Shortest Path First daemon configuration file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Xr ospf6d 8
daemon implements the Open Shortest Path First protocol version 3 as described
in RFC 5340.
.Sh SECTIONS
The
.Nm
config file is divided into three main sections.
.Bl -tag -width xxxx
.It Sy Macros
User-defined variables may be defined and used later, simplifying the
configuration file.
.It Sy Global Configuration
Global settings for
.Xr ospf6d 8 .
A number of global settings can be overruled in specific areas or interfaces.
.It Sy Areas
An OSPF router must be a member of at least one area.
Areas are used to group interfaces, simplifying configuration.
.El
.Pp
Argument names not beginning with a letter, digit, or underscore
must be quoted.
.Pp
Additional configuration files can be included with the
.Ic include
keyword, for example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
include "/etc/ospf6d.sub.conf"
.Ed
.Sh MACROS
Macros can be defined that will later be expanded in context.
Macro names must start with a letter, digit, or underscore,
and may contain any of those characters.
Macro names may not be reserved words (for example,
.Ic area ,
.Ic interface ,
or
.Ic hello-interval ) .
Macros are not expanded inside quotes.
.Pp
For example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
hi="5"
area 0.0.0.0 {
	interface em0 {
		hello-interval $hi
	}
}
.Ed
.Pp
The same can be accomplished by specifying the hello-interval
globally or within the area declaration.
.Sh GLOBAL CONFIGURATION
All interface related settings can be configured globally, per area and per
interface.
The only settings that can be set globally and not overruled are listed below.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Xo
.Ic fib-update
.Pq Ic yes Ns | Ns Ic no
.Xc
If set to
.Ic \&no ,
do not update the Forwarding Information Base, a.k.a. the kernel
routing table.
The default is
.Ic yes .
Setting
.Ic fib-update
to
.Ic \&no
will implicitly set the
.Ic stub Ic router
option to ensure that no traffic tries to transit via this router.
.Pp
.It Xo
.Op Ic no
.Ic redistribute
.Sm off
.Po Ic static Ns | Ns Ic connected Ns | Ns
.Ic default Pc
.Sm on
.Op Ic set ...\&
.Xc
.It Xo
.Op Ic no
.Ic redistribute Ar prefix Op Ic set ...\&
.Xc
.It Xo
.Op Ic no
.Ic redistribute rtlabel Ar label Op Ic set ...\&
.Xc
If set to
.Ic connected ,
routes to directly attached networks will be announced over OSPF.
If set to
.Ic static ,
static routes will be announced over OSPF.
If set to
.Ic default ,
a default route pointing to this router will be announced over OSPF.
It is possible to specify a network range with
.Ar prefix ;
networks need to be part of that range to be redistributed.
Additionally it is possible to redistribute based on route labels
using the
.Ic rtlabel
keyword.
By default no additional routes will be announced over OSPF.
.Pp
.Ic redistribute
statements are evaluated in sequential order, from first to last.
The first matching rule decides if a route should be redistributed or not.
Matching rules starting with
.Ic no
will force the route to be not announced.
The only exception is
.Ic default ,
which will be set no matter what, and additionally
.Ic no
cannot be used together with it.
.Pp
It is possible to set the route
.Ic metric
and
.Ic type
for each redistribute rule.
.Ic type
is either 1 or 2.
The default value for
.Ic type
is 1 and for
.Ic metric
is 100.
Setting more than one option needs curly brackets:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
redistribute static set { metric 300 type 2 }
.Ed
.Pp
.It Ic router-id Ar address
Set the router ID; if not specified, the lowest IPv4 address of
the interfaces used by
.Xr ospf6d 8
will be used.
A router ID must be specified if no IPv4 address is configured on
any interfaces used by
.Xr ospf6d 8 .
.Pp
.It Ic rtlabel Ar label Ic external-tag Ar number
Map route labels to external route tags and vice versa.
The external route tag is a non-negative 32-bit number attached to
AS-external OSPF LSAs.
.Pp
.It Ic spf-delay Ar seconds
Set SPF delay in seconds.
The delay between receiving an update to the link
state database and starting the shortest path first calculation.
The default value is 1; valid range is 1\-10 seconds.
.Pp
.It Ic spf-holdtime Ar seconds
Set the SPF holdtime in seconds.
The minimum time between two consecutive
shortest path first calculations.
The default value is 5 seconds; the valid range is 1\-5 seconds.
.Pp
.It Xo
.Ic stub Ic router
.Pq Ic yes Ns | Ns Ic no
.Xc
If set to
.Ic yes ,
all interfaces with active neighbors will have a metric of infinity.
This ensures that the other routers prefer routes around this router while
still being able to reach directly connected IP prefixes.
The
.Ic stub Ic router
option is automatically enabled if either the
.Xr sysctl 8
variable
.Va net.inet6.ip6.forwarding
is set to a value different to 1 or if the FIB is not coupled.
.El
.Sh AREAS
Areas are used for grouping interfaces.
All interface-specific parameters can
be configured per area, overruling the global settings.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ic area Ar address
Specify an area section, grouping one or more interfaces.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
area 0.0.0.0 {
	interface em0
	interface em1 {
		metric 10
	}
}
.Ed
.El
.Pp
Area specific parameters are listed below.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ic demote Ar group Op Ar count
Increase the
.Xr carp 4
demotion counter by
.Ar count
on the given interface group, usually
.Ar carp ,
when no neighbor in the area is in an active state.
The demotion counter will be decreased when one neighbor in that
area is in an active state.
The default value for
.Ar count
is 1.
.Pp
For more information on interface groups,
see the
.Ic group
keyword in
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
.El
.Sh INTERFACES
Each interface can have several parameters configured individually, otherwise
they are inherited.
An interface is specified by its name.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
interface em0 {
	...
}
.Ed
.Pp
Interface-specific parameters are listed below.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ic demote Ar group
Increase the
.Xr carp 4
demotion counter by 1 on the given interface group, usually
.Ar carp ,
when the interface state is going down.
The demotion counter will be decreased when the interface
state is active again.
.It Ic hello-interval Ar seconds
Set the hello interval.
The default value is 10; valid range is 1\-65535 seconds.
.It Ic metric Ar cost
Set the interface metric a.k.a. cost.
The default value is 10; valid range is 1\-65535.
.It Ic passive
Prevent transmission and reception of OSPF packets on this interface.
The specified interface will be announced as a stub network.
.It Ic retransmit-interval Ar seconds
Set retransmit interval.
The default value is 5 seconds; valid range is 5\-3600 seconds.
.It Ic router-dead-time Ar seconds
Set the router dead time, a.k.a. neighbor inactivity timer.
The default value is 40 seconds; valid range is 2\-65535 seconds.
When a neighbor has been
inactive for router-dead-time its state is set to DOWN.
Neighbors
that have been inactive for more than 24 hours are completely removed.
.It Ic router-priority Ar priority
Set the router priority.
The default value is 1; valid range is 0\-255.
If set
to 0 the router is not eligible as a Designated Router or Backup Designated
Router.
.It Ic transmit-delay Ar seconds
Set the transmit delay.
The default value is 1; valid range is 1\-3600 seconds.

@Welcome ospf6d

The new ospf6d daemon will support OSPFv3, basically OSPF for IPv6 networks.

It is heavily based on ospfd(8), it is more or less a copy and paste of it.
Currently some unneeded stuff has been removed and the trasition from
IPv4 to IPv6 has begun.

ospf6d is not very usefull at the moment, it is being imported to allow more
people to work on it concurrently.

Not yet connected to the builds.
