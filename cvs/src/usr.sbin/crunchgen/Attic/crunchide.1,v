@merge crunchide into crunchgen as the -h flag.  this is not yet done the
nicest way since there is lot of code that has to churn, but it works.

.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm crunchide
.Nd hides symbol names from ld, for crunching programs together
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm crunchide
.Op Fl f Ar keep-list-file
.Op Fl k Ar keep-symbol
.Ar object-file ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
hides the global symbols of
.Ar object-file
such that they are ignored by subsequent runs of the linker,
.Xr ld 1 .
Some symbols may be left visible via the
.Fl k Ar keep-symbol
and
.Fl f Ar keep-list-file
options.
The
.Ar keep-list-file
must contain a list of symbols to keep visible, one symbol per line.
Note that the C compiler prepends an underscore in front of
symbols, so to keep the C function ``foo'' visible, the option
.Dq -k _foo
must be used.
.Pp
.Nm
is designed as a companion program for
.Xr crunchgen 1 ,
which automates the process of creating crunched binaries from
multiple component programs.
.Sh NOTES
The ELF version of
.Nm crunchide
mangles the symbol table beyond recognition.
It is therefore not advisable to try to run
.Xr nm 1
on a crunched object file.
This is due to the nature of the ELF symbol table
and how some arches uses the symbol attributes for their GOT build.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr crunchgen 1 ,
.Xr ld 1

@Merge crunchgen & crunchhide (using name checking), and move to usr.sbin
next step is to not install it as two programs, but be even more clever
