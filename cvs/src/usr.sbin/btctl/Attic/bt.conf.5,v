log
@as with other list types, column lists generally do not need a Pp/-compact
construct;

this also sidesteps what seems to be a problem with mandoc, in that
"-column -compact" seems to mess up the formatting. thus these pages should
now have their lists formatted nicely (i.e. correctly aligned and with indent
applied);

as a side note, the fact that headers are not properly marked up is another
issue which will be addressed separately (a mandoc fix is needed, i think).
i have fudged a few of these to mark up properly, since the workaround does
make sense for some pages.

as another side note, i haven;t fixed man7, as i need to prepare a separate
diff for kristaps and ingo.
