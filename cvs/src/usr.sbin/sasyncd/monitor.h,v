log
@Add support to use sasyncd(8) with iked(8) instead of isakmpd(8).  The
new config option "control isakmpd|iked|all|none" in sasyncd.conf(5)
is used to set the mode; the default is to control isakmpd like
before.  When controlling iked, sasyncd connects to the daemon using
the imsg socket and sends imsgs - this is easy because the imsg
framework has been imported into libutil. iked(8) already includes
the important bits to work with sasyncd(8) (the active/passive mode
option in ikectl).
