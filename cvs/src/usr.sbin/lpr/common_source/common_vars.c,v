@Replace <sys/param.h> with <limits.h> and other less dirty headers where
possible.  Annotate <sys/param.h> lines with their current reasons.  Switch
to PATH_MAX, NGROUPS_MAX, HOST_NAME_MAX+1, LOGIN_NAME_MAX, etc.  Change
MIN() and MAX() to local definitions of MINIMUM() and MAXIMUM() where
sensible to avoid pulling in the pollution.  These are the files confirmed
through binary verification.
ok guenther, millert, doug (helped with the verification protocol)

@rcsid[] and sccsid[] and copyright[] are essentially unmaintained (and
unmaintainable).  these days, people use source.  these id's do not provide
any benefit, and do hurt the small install media
(the 33,000 line diff is essentially mechanical)
ok with the idea millert, ok dms

log
@Remove setuid root from lp*.  lpr needs to be setuid daemon so the
files it creates are not owned by the user spooling them but the
others (lpc, lpq, lprm) can get away with setgid daemon.  lpd runs
as user daemon for most things, only changing its uid to 0 for
things that must be done as root.

For the time being, don't require connections to come from a reserved
port since lpq/lpr/lprm can't acquire that w/o setuid root.  In the
near future we will have a mechanism for select non-root processes
to grab reserved ports.

The upshot of this is that spool directories must be writable by
group daemon and the files within the spool dirs must be owned by
daemon.

log
@Pull in useful bits from NetBSD and make our lp* easier to diff and
do some minor cleanup of my own:

o IPv6 support
o ANSI function headers
o use getopt()
o synce usage() with man pages
o passes -Wall on both 32bit and 64bit platforms
o add an option to set the max number of children lpd will fork off
o add an lpd option to bind to specific addresses instead of INADDR_ANY.
o allow user to specify how long to wait for a connection to remote servers
o more strlcpy() and snprintf() usage
o Use FOO_FILENO constants instead of hard-coding 0-2
o Add some keeps to man the page SYNOPSIS to avoid options being split
