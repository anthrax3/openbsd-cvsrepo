Access control
.PP
The printer system maintains protected spooling areas so that
users cannot circumvent printer accounting or
remove files other than their own.
The strategy used to maintain protected
spooling areas is as follows:
.IP \(bu 3
The spooling area is writable only by \fIroot\fP and
and the \fIdaemon\fP group.
.IP \(bu 3
The \fIlpr\fP and \fIlprm\fP programs run set-user-id to user \fIdaemon\fP and
set-group-id to group \fIdaemon\fP.
.IP \(bu 3
The \fIlpc\fP and \fIlpq\fP programs run set-group-id to group \fIdaemon\fP
to access spool files.
.IP \(bu 3
Control and data files in a spooling area are made with \fIdaemon\fP
ownership and group ownership \fIdaemon\fP.  Their mode is 0660.
This ensures control files are not modified by a user
and that no user can remove files except through \fIlprm\fP.
.IP \(bu 3
The printer server, \fIlpd\fP, runs as \fIroot\fP but spends most
of its time with the effective user-id set to \fIdaemon\fP and the
effective group-id set to \fIdaemon\fP.  As a result, spool files
it creates belong to user and group \fIdaemon\fP.  \fILpd\fP uses
the same verification procedures as \fIrshd\fP\|(8) in authenticating
remote clients.  The host on which a client resides must be present
in the file /etc/hosts.equiv or /etc/hosts.lpd and the request
message must come from a reserved port number.

log
@Remove setuid root from lp*.  lpr needs to be setuid daemon so the
files it creates are not owned by the user spooling them but the
others (lpc, lpq, lprm) can get away with setgid daemon.  lpd runs
as user daemon for most things, only changing its uid to 0 for
things that must be done as root.

For the time being, don't require connections to come from a reserved
port since lpq/lpr/lprm can't acquire that w/o setuid root.  In the
near future we will have a mechanism for select non-root processes
to grab reserved ports.

The upshot of this is that spool directories must be writable by
group daemon and the files within the spool dirs must be owned by
daemon.

The \fIlpr\fP program runs set-user-id to \fIroot\fP and
set-group-id to group \fIdaemon\fP.  The \fIroot\fP access permits
reading any file required. Accessibility is verified
with an \fIaccess\fP\|(2) call.  The group ID
is used in setting up proper ownership of files
in the spooling area for \fIlprm\fP.

The spooling programs,
\fIlpd\fP, \fIlpq\fP, and \fIlprm\fP run set-user-id to \fIroot\fP
and set-group-id to group \fIdaemon\fP to access spool files and printers.
.IP \(bu 3
The printer server, \fIlpd\fP,
uses the same verification procedures as \fIrshd\fP\|(8C)
in authenticating remote clients.  The host on which a client
resides must be present in the file /etc/hosts.equiv or /etc/hosts.lpd and
the request message must come from a reserved port number.
.PP
In practice, none of \fIlpd\fP, \fIlpq\fP, or
\fIlprm\fP would have to run as user \fIroot\fP if remote
spooling were not supported.  In previous incarnations of
the printer system \fIlpd\fP ran set-user-id to \fIdaemon\fP,
set-group-id to group \fIspooling\fP, and \fIlpq\fP and \fIlprm\fP ran
set-group-id to group \fIspooling\fP.
