.Nm pac
.Nd printer/plotter accounting information
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm pac
.Op Fl cmrs
.Bk -words
.Op Fl P Ns Ar printer
.Ek
.Bk -words
.Op Fl p Ns Ar price
.Ek
.Op Ar user ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm pac
reads the printer/plotter accounting files, accumulating the number
of pages (the usual case) or feet (for raster devices)
of paper consumed by each named
.Ar user ,
and prints out how much each user consumed in pages or feet and dollars.
.Pp
When no
.Ar user
arguments are given, statistics are printed for every user who has used any
paper.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl P Ns Ar printer
Accounting is done for the named printer.
Normally, accounting is done for the default printer (site dependent) or
the value of the environment variable
.Ev PRINTER
is used.
.It Fl c
Causes the output to be sorted by cost; usually the
output is sorted alphabetically by name.
.It Fl m
Causes the host name to be ignored in the accounting file.
This allows for a user on multiple machines to have all of his printing
charges grouped together.
.It Fl p Ns Ar price
The value
.Ar price
is used for the cost in dollars instead of the default value of 0.02
or the price specified in
.Pa /etc/printcap .
.It Fl r
Reverse the sorting order.
.It Fl s
Accounting information is summarized on the
summary accounting file; this summarization is necessary since on a
busy system, the accounting file can grow by several lines per day.
.El
.Sh OUTPUT FORMAT
.Nm
formats the output into a simple table, using four columns:
.Bl -enum
.It
The host name followed by the user's login name (column "Login").
If the
.Fl m
option was specified, the host name will be omitted.
.It
The number of pages or feet printed (column "pages/feet").
.It
The number of copies made (column "runs").
.It
The total price for the user (column "price").
.El
.Pp
If no
.Ar user
argument was specified,
.Nm
will print a summary line with print totals.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /var/account/?_sum -compact
.It Pa /var/account/?acct
raw accounting files
.It Pa /var/account/?_sum
summary accounting files
.It Pa /etc/printcap
printer capability database
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr printcap 5
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command appeared in
.Bx 4.0 .
.Sh BUGS
The relationship between the computed price and reality is
as yet unknown.

@Pull in useful bits from NetBSD and make our lp* easier to diff and
do some minor cleanup of my own:

o IPv6 support
o ANSI function headers
o use getopt()
o synce usage() with man pages
o passes -Wall on both 32bit and 64bit platforms
o add an option to set the max number of children lpd will fork off
o add an lpd option to bind to specific addresses instead of INADDR_ANY.
o allow user to specify how long to wait for a connection to remote servers
o more strlcpy() and snprintf() usage
o Use FOO_FILENO constants instead of hard-coding 0-2
o Add some keeps to man the page SYNOPSIS to avoid options being split
