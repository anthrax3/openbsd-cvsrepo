 * Leland Stanford Junior University.
 */

/*
 * A DVMRP message consists of an IP header + an IGMP header + (for some types)
 * zero or more bytes of data.
 *
 * For REPORT messages, the data is route information; the route information
 * consists of one or more lists of the following form:
 *
 *		(mask, (origin, metric), (origin, metric), ...)
 *
 * where:
 *
 *	"mask" is the subnet mask for all the origins in the list.
 *		It is always THREE bytes long, containing the low-order
 *		three bytes of the mask (the high-order byte is always
 *		0xff and therefore need not be transmitted).
 *
 *	"origin" is the number of a subnet from which multicast datagrams
 *		may originate.  It is from one to four bytes long,
 *		depending on the value of "mask":
 *			if all bytes of the mask are zero
 *			    the subnet number is one byte long
 *			else if the low-order two bytes of the mask are zero
 *			    the subnet number is two bytes long
 *			else if the lowest-order byte of the mask is zero
 *			    the subnet number is three bytes long,
 *			else
 *			    the subnet number is four bytes long.
 *
 *	"metric" is a one-byte value consisting of two subfields:
 *		- the high-order bit is a flag which, when set, indicates
 *		  the last (origin, metric) pair of a list.
 *		- the low-order seven bits contain the routing metric for
 *		  the corresponding origin, relative to the sender of the
 *		  DVMRP report.  The metric may have the value of UNREACHABLE
 *		  added to it as a "split horizon" indication (so called
 *		  "poisoned reverse").
 *
 * Within a list, the origin subnet numbers must be in ascending order, and
 * the lists themselves are in order of increasing mask value.  A message may
 * not exceed 576 bytes, the default maximum IP reassembly size, including
 * the IP and IGMP headers; the route information may be split across more
 * than one message if necessary, by terminating a list in one message and
 * starting a new list in the next message (repeating the same mask value,
 * if necessary).
 *
 * For NEIGHBORS messages, the data is neighboring-router information
 * consisting of one or more lists of the following form:
 *
 *	(local-addr, metric, threshold, ncount, neighbor, neighbor, ...)
 *
 * where:
 *
 *	"local-addr" is the sending router's address as seen by the neighbors
 *		     in this list; it is always four bytes long.
 *	"metric" is a one-byte unsigned value, the TTL `cost' of forwarding
 *		 packets to any of the neighbors on this list.
 *	"threshold" is a one-byte unsigned value, a lower bound on the TTL a
 *		    packet must have to be forwarded to any of the neighbors on
 *		    this list.
 *	"ncount" is the number of neighbors in this list.
 *	"neighbor" is the address of a neighboring router, four bytes long.
 *
 * As with REPORT messages, NEIGHBORS messages should not exceed 576 bytes,
 * including the IP and IGMP headers; split longer messages by terminating the
 * list in one and continuing in another, repeating the local-addr, etc., if
 * necessary.
 *
 * For NEIGHBORS2 messages, the data is identical to NEIGHBORS except
 * there is a flags byte before the neighbor count:
 *
 *	(local-addr, metric, threshold, flags, ncount, neighbor, neighbor, ...)
