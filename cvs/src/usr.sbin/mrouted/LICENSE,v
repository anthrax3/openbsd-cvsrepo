@After 2 years, and more than 350 pieces of mail exchanged with "the
right people" at Stanford, we finally succeed at getting the parts of
the code they wrote to be released under a BSD license.  The other
components were written by USC and Xerox (who were quick at helping, 5
days and 6 weeks if I recall).  Of the ~200 authors we have contacted
regarding license issues, this institution has been THE WORST to deal
with, and to think -- this is an American University.  How far the edifice
of educational freedom has fallen.... shame on you Stanford.

code of the derivative version at no charge to STANFORD.

5. STANFORD MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED.
By way of example, but not limitation, STANFORD MAKES NO REPRESENTATION
OR WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR
THAT THE USE OF THE LICENSED PROGRAM WILL NOT INFRINGE ANY PATENTS,

for any liability nor for any direct, indirect or consequential damages
with respect to any claim by LICENSEE or any third party on account of or
arising from this Agreement or use of the Program.
