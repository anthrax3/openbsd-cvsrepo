@It is a big pleasure for me to remove this highe pile of gunk from the tree.
dhclient, dhcrelay and dhcpd have been factored out and cleaned up big time,
dhcpd and dhcrelay chroot itself, drop privileges and lock their bpf
descriptors after applyiing read/write filters now, and this pile of ISC code
with it's lovely char ServerName; /* Name of Server */ constructs is
obsolete.
theo ok, I owe you some beers for this pleasure

- Don't trust hostnames provided by client - Win95 allows *spaces* in
  client-supplied hostnames!

- Be lenient in parsing client-hostname statement in case a bad hostname
  got recorded.

970607

- Change size_t to ssize_t in return values where a negative number
  is used to indicate an error.

- Always write out two digits for single-byte quantities in arrays.

- When parsing a lease database, correctly transfer the client
  hostname and hostname to the memory-resident lease structure.

- If the lease we want to give the client is different than the
  one it's asking for, and we recognize the one it's asking for as
  ours, NAK it.

- Only accept a DHCPRELEASE or DHCPNAK if the client supplies an IP
  address and the lease corresponding to that address is available to
  that client.

- Make it a warning rather than an error if resolv.conf is missing.

970605

- Add client-hostname token to lexer so that the parser can use it.
  Fixes a serious lease database bug.

- Disable log message on receipt of short ICMP Echo replies.

970602

- Added DHCP Client scripts for FreeBSD, Solaris, and Linux, but
  they're not guaranteed to work.

- Added some Cygwin32 (Windows NT/Windows 95) support, but this is not
  sufficiently complete to be useful yet.

- Updated README

- Put something useful in TODO - formerly it mostly listed projects
  that were way out on the back burner.

In DHCP Client:

- Add default, supersede, prepend and append option support, so that a
  client can override or modify server-supplied options, and provide
  default values if the server provides no values.

- Add reject keyword, so that packets from rogue DHCP or BOOTP servers
  can be rejected out of hand.

- Added support for booting from BOOTP servers.

- Added BOOTP flag to client lease declaration, to indicated that a
  particular lease was acquired through a BOOTP server.

- Don't try to do INIT-REBOOT on leases acquired from BOOTP servers.

- Print server's IP address instead of its IP address when logging
  DHCP/BOOTP messages received by client.

- Fix some bugs in saved lease activation.

- Fix some scripting bugs.

- New sample dhclient.conf script demonstrates new features.

In common code:

- Partially implemented asynchronous DNS lookups.

- Fixed some bugs in dispatch routine.

- Fix date parsing bug that was setting dates forward one day every
  time dhcpd was restarted (this has been fixed for a while in the 1.0
  branch).

- Change name-server option name to ien116-name-server so as to reduce
  the potential for confusion.

DHCP Relay daemon:

- Fixed an operator precedence bug having to do with the broadcast
  flag.

DHCP Server:

- Add support to record the client-supplied hostname in the lease file,
  for better readability.

- Fixed a bug in the renewal code that resulted in the server ignoring
  unicast renewals from non-local subnets.   This bug caused some
  heartburn for Win95 machines.

- Copy ciaddr from saved ciaddr, not from giaddr.

- New -t flag tests /etc/dhcpd.conf for syntax errors.
