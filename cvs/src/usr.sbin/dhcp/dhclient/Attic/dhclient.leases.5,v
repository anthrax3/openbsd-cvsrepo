@It is a big pleasure for me to remove this highe pile of gunk from the tree.
dhclient, dhcrelay and dhcpd have been factored out and cleaned up big time,
dhcpd and dhcrelay chroot itself, drop privileges and lock their bpf
descriptors after applyiing read/write filters now, and this pile of ISC code
with it's lovely char ServerName; /* Name of Server */ constructs is
obsolete.
theo ok, I owe you some beers for this pleasure

.Sh NAME
.Nm dhclient.leases
.Nd DHCP client lease database
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The Internet Software Consortium DHCP client keeps a persistent
database of leases that it has acquired that are still valid.
The database is a free-form ASCII file containing one valid declaration
per lease.
If more than one declaration appears for a given lease,
the last one in the file is used.
The file is written as a log, so this is not an unusual occurrence.
.Pp
The format of the lease declarations is described in
.Xr dhclient.conf 5 .
.Sh FILES
/var/db/dhclient.leases

.Xr dhclient.conf 5 ,
.Xr dhcp-options 5 ,
