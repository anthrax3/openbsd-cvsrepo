@It is a big pleasure for me to remove this highe pile of gunk from the tree.
dhclient, dhcrelay and dhcpd have been factored out and cleaned up big time,
dhcpd and dhcrelay chroot itself, drop privileges and lock their bpf
descriptors after applyiing read/write filters now, and this pile of ISC code
with it's lovely char ServerName; /* Name of Server */ constructs is
obsolete.
theo ok, I owe you some beers for this pleasure
