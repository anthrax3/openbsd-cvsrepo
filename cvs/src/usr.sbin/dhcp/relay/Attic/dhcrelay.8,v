@It is a big pleasure for me to remove this highe pile of gunk from the tree.
dhclient, dhcrelay and dhcpd have been factored out and cleaned up big time,
dhcpd and dhcrelay chroot itself, drop privileges and lock their bpf
descriptors after applyiing read/write filters now, and this pile of ISC code
with it's lovely char ServerName; /* Name of Server */ constructs is
obsolete.
theo ok, I owe you some beers for this pleasure

.Nm dhcrelay
.Nd Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Relay Agent

.Nm dhcrelay

.Xo
.Oo Fl i Ar if0 Oo Ar ...
.Fl i Ar ifN Oc Oc
.Xc
.Ar server0 Op Ar ... serverN
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The Internet Software Consortium DHCP Relay Agent,
.Nm dhcrelay ,
provides a means for relaying DHCP and BOOTP requests from a subnet to which
no DHCP server is directly connected to one or more DHCP servers on other
subnets.
.Sh OPERATION
The DHCP Relay Agent listens for DHCP requests on all interfaces
attached to a host, unless one or more interfaces are specified on the
command line with the
.Fl i
flag.
.Pp
When a query is received,
.Nm
forwards it to the list of DHCP servers specified on the command line.
When a reply is received, it is broadcast or unicast on the network from
whence the original request came.
.Pp
It is possible to specify a set of interfaces on which
.Nm
will listen, so that if
.Nm
is connected through one interface to a network on which there is no DHCP
server, but is connected on another interface to a network on which there
is a DHCP server, it will not relay DHCP and BOOTP requests from the network
on which the server exists to that server.
This is an imperfect solution.
.Sh COMMAND LINE
The names of the network interfaces that
.Nm
should attempt to configure may be specified on the command line using the
.Fl i
option.
If no interface names are specified on the command line,
.Nm
will identify all network interfaces, eliminating non-broadcast interfaces
if possible, and attempt to configure each interface.
.Pp
If
.Nm
should listen and transmit on a port other than the standard (port 67), the
.Fl p
flag may used.
It should be followed by the UDP port number that
.Nm
should use.
This is mostly useful for debugging purposes.
If the
.Fl p
flag is specified, the relay agent will transmit responses to clients
at a port number that is one greater than the one specified \- i.e., if
you specify
.Fl p
67, then the relay agent will listen on port 67 and transmit to port 68.
Transmissions to servers will be sent to the same port number
that is specified with the
.Fl p
flag.
.Pp
.Nm
will normally run in the foreground until it has configured
an interface, and then will revert to running in the background.
To force
.Nm
to always run as a foreground process, the
.Fl d
flag should be specified.
This is useful when running
.Nm
under a debugger, or when running it out of inittab on System V systems.
.Pp
.Nm
will normally print its network configuration on startup.
This can be annoying in a system startup script \- to disable this
behaviour, specify the
.Fl q
flag.
.Pp
The name of at least one DHCP server to which DHCP and BOOTP requests
should be relayed must be specified on the command line.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr dhclient 8 ,
.Xr dhcpd 8
.Pp
RFC 2132, RFC 2131.

.Sh BUGS
Relayed DHCP traffic could actually safely be protected by IPsec, but
like
.Xr dhcpd 8
and
.Xr dhclient 8 ,
.Nm
will bypass IPsec for all its traffic.
