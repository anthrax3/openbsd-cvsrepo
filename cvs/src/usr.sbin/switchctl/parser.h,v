@Add simple client to add flows from switchctl.  Not finished yet, but
it is better for rzalamena and me to work on it in the tree.

log
@Add a simple openflow client to dump switch information.  The
implementation re-uses the openflow code from switchd. Not finished
yet, but it is better to continue working on it in the tree.  Later
versions will also include a way to add flows from the command line -
this is being worked on for switchd and some code of the
"ASCII-to-flow" parser will be shared here as well.

As discussed with and lightly tested by rzalamena@@

1.2
log
@Start reworking the "device" support in switchd: Once connected, a
device is just an fd that is connected to a switch, either via TCP or
via /dev/switch.  Change the switchctl from "device add" to "connect"
etc.  This change is an intermediate step towards other changes,
including the configuration grammar, so a few things will be left
undocumented for now.

switchctl(8) examples,
switchctl connect /dev/switch0
switchctl connect /dev/switch0 forward-to 10.1.1.1
switchctl connect 127.0.0.1
switchctl connect 127.0.0.1 forward-to 10.1.1.1
switchctl disconnect /dev/switch0

1.1
log
@Import switchd(8), a basic WIP OpenFlow implementation for OpenBSD.

switchd consists of two parts:
1. switchd(8) and switchctl(8), an OpenFlow controller or "vswitch".
2. switch(4), an OpenFlow-aware kernel "bridge".

This the 1st part, the driver will be imported later.  The code will
remain disabled for a while, but it helps development to have it in
the tree.  switchd currently supports partial OpenFlow 1.0, but the
goal is to use OpenFlow 1.3.5 instead (switch(4) already does 1.3.5).

For more background information see:
