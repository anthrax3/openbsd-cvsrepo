.Sh NAME
.Nm ypset
.Nd tell ypbind(8) which YP server process to use
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm ypset
.Op Fl d Ar domain
.Op Fl h Ar host
.Ar server
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
tells the
.Xr ypbind 8
process on the current machine which YP server process to communicate with.
If
.Ar server
is down or is not running a YP server process, it is not discovered until
a YP client process attempts to access a YP map, at which time
.Xr ypbind 8
tests the binding and takes appropriate action.
.Pp
.Nm
is most useful for binding a YP client that is not on the same broadcast
network as the closest YP server, but can also be used for debugging
a local network's YP configuration, testing specific YP client
programs, or binding to a specific server when there are many servers on
the local network supplying YP maps.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl d Ar domain
Use the YP domain
.Ar domain
instead of the default domain as returned by
.Xr domainname 1 .
.It Fl h Ar host
Set the YP binding on
.Ar host
instead of the local machine.
.El

@First pass at removing clauses 3 and 4 from NetBSD licenses.

Not sure what's more surprising: how long it took for NetBSD to
catch up to the rest of the BSDs (including UCB), or the amount of
code that NetBSD has claimed for itself without attributing to the
actual authors.
