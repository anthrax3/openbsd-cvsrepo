@check_tos() gets a parameter so i can remove another global var.

@introduce struct tr_conf to keep all of the configuration.
Functions needing access to any of those vars get it passed as a parameter.
result: even less global vars.

1.2
log
@traceroute never sees a timeout when poll(2) returns when it receives
a packet not intended for us. E.g. a ping(8) is running in parallel.
In this case we need to account for the time we already waited.

Pointed out by Gabriel Nieto <gabnietof AT gmail>, thanks!

Looks good to and input millert@@

1.1
log
@rearrange code: traceroute.c now only contains main() and usage(),
worker.c contains all other functions, and i tracked down which global
variables are used in which file and marked them accordingly with
static (or not). No functional change, just the basis of further work.
