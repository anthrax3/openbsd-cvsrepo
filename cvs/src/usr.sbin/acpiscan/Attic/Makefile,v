@Revert acpiscan commit.  This should have replaced acpidump instead of
being a new tool.  My bad.

@Add Jordan's acpiscan acpi table dump tool.  The current tool, acpidump,
does not dump all relevant tables and will eventually be deprecated by this.
It needs some more cleanup but we need to start getting acpi dumps from
the field using this instead of acpidump.

Code written by jordan, cleanup by me.
