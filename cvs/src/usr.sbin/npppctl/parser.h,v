1.1
log
@Replace npppdctl(8) by new npppctl(8).  npppctl was written from
scratch, it uses parser.c derived from ikectl(8) to have OpenBSD's
fashion.  This includes related changes listed below:
- changed npppd control IPC heavyly.
- support IPv6 as tunnel source address.
- deleted support changing the configuration of npppd_ctl on running.
  Because it is not so needed but it requires privilege operations.
- refactors.

man page helps from jmc.  tested by sebastia.
