@Welcome ospfd
started by Esben Norby some time ago by using the imsg/three process framework
of bgpd. He implemented the basic concept plus the ospf finite state machines.
Later I joined and helped him cleanup, debug and extend his work.
Right now it is not particularly useful, major parts are still missing but is
imported to allow more people to work on it.
status:
The basic protocol works for broadcast networks and the LS database is
synchronized and updated. It is not possible to be DR or BDR on a network
and other interface types like point-to-point are not yet supported.
The shortest path tree is not calculated and so no routing information is
exchanged with the kernel FIB.

Not yet connected to the builds.
