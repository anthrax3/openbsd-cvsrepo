@Add RADIUS accounting support and some authentication related changes:

- Add functions to radius+.c that are required to implement RADIUS
  accounting.
- Send RADIUS Account-Start and Account-Stop messages with attributes that
  are defined by RFC 2866, 2868, 2869.
- If any authentication realm is deleted from the configuration, npppd may
  exit by segmentation fault.
- Delete radius_common.c, radius_common.h and eap.c because they are not
  used.
- Retransmission and failover are reimplemented.
- Cleanup
