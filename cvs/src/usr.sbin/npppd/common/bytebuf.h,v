@Translate Japanese comments or labels into English.  Translation was
done by IIJ people (MATSUI Yoshihiro, SAITOH Masanobu, Tomoyuki Sahara),
yuo@@ and myself.

This diff also includes
 - delete part of useless comments, correct spelling.
 - add man page of npppdctl.

There is no functional change.
