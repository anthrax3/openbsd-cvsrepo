@Don't use random() because it's not safe.  Use arc4random() instead of
it.  Suggested by deraadt.

@Replace npppdctl(8) by new npppctl(8).  npppctl was written from
scratch, it uses parser.c derived from ikectl(8) to have OpenBSD's
fashion.  This includes related changes listed below:
- changed npppd control IPC heavyly.
- support IPv6 as tunnel source address.
- deleted support changing the configuration of npppd_ctl on running.
  Because it is not so needed but it requires privilege operations.
- refactors.

man page helps from jmc.  tested by sebastia.

@Translate Japanese comments or labels into English.  Translation was
done by IIJ people (MATSUI Yoshihiro, SAITOH Masanobu, Tomoyuki Sahara),
yuo@@ and myself.

This diff also includes
 - delete part of useless comments, correct spelling.
 - add man page of npppdctl.

There is no functional change.

@Initial import npppd(8).  npppd is a new PPP daemon that handles many
ppp sessions as a server.  It supports L2TP, PPTP and PPPoE as
tunneling.
