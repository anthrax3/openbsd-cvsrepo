.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBrndc\fR controls the operation of a name server\&. It supersedes the \fBndc\fR utility that was provided in old BIND releases\&. If \fBrndc\fR is invoked with no command line options or arguments, it prints a short summary of the supported commands and the available options and their arguments\&.
.PP
\fBrndc\fR communicates with the name server over a TCP connection, sending commands authenticated with digital signatures\&. In the current versions of \fBrndc\fR and \fBnamed\fR, the only supported authentication algorithm is HMAC\-MD5, which uses a shared secret on each end of the connection\&. This provides TSIG\-style authentication for the command request and the name server's response\&. All commands sent over the channel must be signed by a key_id known to the server\&.
.PP
\fBrndc\fR reads a configuration file to determine how to contact the name server and decide what algorithm and key it should use\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\-b \fIsource\-address\fR
Use \fIsource\-address\fR as the source address for the connection to the server\&. Multiple instances are permitted to allow setting of both the IPv4 and IPv6 source addresses\&.
.TP
\-c \fIconfig\-file\fR
Use \fIconfig\-file\fR as the configuration file instead of the default, \fI/etc/rndc\&.conf\fR\&.
.TP
\-k \fIkey\-file\fR
Use \fIkey\-file\fR as the key file instead of the default, \fI/etc/rndc\&.key\fR\&. The key in \fI/etc/rndc\&.key\fR will be used to authenticate commands sent to the server if the \fIconfig\-file\fR does not exist\&.
.TP
\-s \fIserver\fR
\fIserver\fR is the name or address of the server which matches a server statement in the configuration file for \fBrndc\fR\&. If no server is supplied on the command line, the host named by the default\-server clause in the options statement of the \fBrndc\fR configuration file will be used\&.
.TP
\-p \fIport\fR
Send commands to TCP port \fIport\fR instead of BIND 9's default control channel port, 953\&.
.TP
\-V
Enable verbose logging\&.
.TP
\-y \fIkey_id\fR
Use the key \fIkey_id\fR from the configuration file\&. \fIkey_id\fR must be known by named with the same algorithm and secret string in order for control message validation to succeed\&. If no \fIkey_id\fR is specified, \fBrndc\fR will first look for a key clause in the server statement of the server being used, or if no server statement is present for that host, then the default\-key clause of the options statement\&. Note that the configuration file contains shared secrets which are used to send authenticated control commands to name servers\&. It should therefore not have general read or write access\&.
.PP
For the complete set of commands supported by \fBrndc\fR, see the BIND 9 Administrator Reference Manual or run \fBrndc\fR without arguments to see its help message\&.
.SH "LIMITATIONS"
.PP
\fBrndc\fR does not yet support all the commands of the BIND 8 \fBndc\fR utility\&.
.PP
There is currently no way to provide the shared secret for a \fBkey_id\fR without using the configuration file\&.
.PP
Several error messages could be clearer\&.
