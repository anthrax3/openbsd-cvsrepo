.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBnamed\fR is a Domain Name System (DNS) server, part of the BIND 9 distribution from ISC\&. For more information on the DNS, see RFCs 1033, 1034, and 1035\&.
.PP
When invoked without arguments, \fBnamed\fR will fork into two processes for privilege separation, \fBchroot(2)\fR to \fB/var/named\fR, read the default configuration file \fI/var/named/etc/named\&.conf\fR, read any initial data, and listen for queries\&. The privileged process will communicate with the child and \fBbind(2)\fR to privileged ports on its behalf\&. See CAVEATS section below\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\-4
Use IPv4 only even if the host machine is capable of IPv6\&. \fB\-4\fR and \fB\-6\fR are mutually exclusive\&.
.TP
\-6
Use IPv6 only even if the host machine is capable of IPv4\&. \fB\-4\fR and \fB\-6\fR are mutually exclusive\&.
.TP
\-c \fIconfig\-file\fR
Use \fIconfig\-file\fR as the configuration file instead of the default, \fI/etc/named\&.conf\fR\&. To ensure that reloading the configuration file continues to work after the server has changed its working directory due to to a possible \fBdirectory\fR option in the configuration file, \fIconfig\-file\fR should be an absolute pathname\&.
.TP
\-d \fIdebug\-level\fR
Set the daemon's debug level to \fIdebug\-level\fR\&. Debugging traces from \fBnamed\fR become more verbose as the debug level increases\&.
.TP
\-f
Run the server in the foreground (i\&.e\&. do not daemonize)\&.
.TP
\-g
Run the server in the foreground and force all logging to \fIstderr\fR\&.
.TP
\-m \fIflag\fR
Turn on memory usage debugging flags\&. Possible flags are \fIusage\fR, \fItrace\fR, \fIrecord\fR, \fIsize\fR, and \fImctx\fR\&. These correspond to the ISC_MEM_DEBUGXXXX flags described in \fI<isc/mem\&.h>\fR\&.
.TP
\-i \fIpid\-file\fR
Specifies the file that contains the process ID of \fBnamed\fR\&. The default is \fI/var/run/named\&.pid\fR\&.
.TP
\-n \fI#cpus\fR
Create \fI#cpus\fR worker threads to take advantage of multiple CPUs\&. If not specified, \fBnamed\fR will try to determine the number of CPUs present and create one thread per CPU\&. If it is unable to determine the number of CPUs, a single worker thread will be created\&.
.TP
\-p \fIport\fR
Listen for queries on port \fIport\fR\&. If not specified, the default is port 53\&.
.TP
\-s
Write memory usage statistics to \fIstdout\fR on exit\&.
.RS
.B "Note:"
This option is mainly of interest to BIND 9 developers and may be removed or changed in a future release\&.
.RE
.TP
\-t \fIdirectory\fR
Chroot to \fIdirectory\fR after processing the command line arguments, but before reading the configuration file\&.
.RS
.B "Warning:"
This option should be used in conjunction with the \fB\-u\fR option, as chrooting a process running as root doesn't enhance security on most systems; the way \fBchroot(2)\fR is defined allows a process with root privileges to escape a chroot jail\&.
.RE
.TP
\-u \fIuser\fR
Setuid to \fIuser\fR after completing privileged operations, such as creating sockets that listen on privileged ports\&.
.RS
.B "Note:"
On Linux, \fBnamed\fR uses the kernel's capability mechanism to drop all root privileges except the ability to \fBbind(2)\fR to a privileged port and set process resource limits\&. Unfortunately, this means that the \fB\-u\fR option only works when \fBnamed\fR is run on kernel 2\&.2\&.18 or later, or kernel 2\&.3\&.99\-pre3 or later, since previous kernels did not allow privileges to be retained after \fBsetuid(2)\fR\&.
.RE
.TP
\-v
Report the version number and exit\&.
.TP
\-x \fIcache\-file\fR
Load data from \fIcache\-file\fR into the cache of the default view\&.
.RS
.B "Warning:"
This option must not be used\&. It is only of interest to BIND 9 developers and may be removed or changed in a future release\&.
.RE
.SH "SIGNALS"
.PP
In routine operation, signals should not be used to control the nameserver; \fBrndc\fR should be used instead\&.
.TP
SIGHUP
Force a reload of the server\&.
.TP
SIGINT, SIGTERM
Shut down the server\&.
.PP
The result of sending any other signals to the server is undefined\&.
.SH "CONFIGURATION"
.PP
The \fBnamed\fR configuration file is too complex to describe in detail here\&. A complete description is provided in the BIND 9 Administrator Reference Manual\&.
.SH "CAVEATS"
.PP
 \fBnamed\fR runs privilege separated for binding the privileged ports after an interface or address change\&. The privileged process will only allow \fBnamed\fR to \fBbind(2)\fR to default ports\&. Make sure you use unprivileged (>1024) ports if you change any of the default ports in \fBnamed\fR's configuration or on the command\-line\&.
.SH "FILES"
.TP
\fI/etc/named\&.conf\fR
The default configuration file\&.
.TP
\fI/var/run/named\&.pid\fR
The default process\-id file\&.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.PP

On Linux, \fBnamed\fR uses the kernel's
capability mechanism to drop all root privileges
except the ability to \fBbind()\fR to a
privileged port and set process resource limits.
Unfortunately, this means that the \fB-u\fR
option only works when \fBnamed\fR is run
on kernel 2.2.18 or later, or kernel 2.3.99-pre3 or
later, since previous kernels did not allow privileges
to be retained after \fBsetuid()\fR.
