.TH "DNSSEC-SIGNKEY" "8" "June 30, 2000" "BIND9" ""
.SH NAME
dnssec-signkey \- DNSSEC key set signing tool
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBdnssec-signkey\fR [ \fB-a\fR ]  [ \fB-c \fIclass\fB\fR ]  [ \fB-s \fIstart-time\fB\fR ]  [ \fB-e \fIend-time\fB\fR ]  [ \fB-h\fR ]  [ \fB-p\fR ]  [ \fB-r \fIrandomdev\fB\fR ]  [ \fB-v \fIlevel\fB\fR ]  \fBkeyset\fR \fBkey\fR\fI...\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBdnssec-signkey\fR signs a keyset. Typically
the keyset will be for a child zone, and will have been generated
by \fBdnssec-makekeyset\fR. The child zone's keyset
is signed with the zone keys for its parent zone. The output file
is of the form \fIsignedkey-nnnn.\fR, where
\fInnnn\fR is the zone name.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB-a\fR
Verify all generated signatures.
.TP
\fB-c \fIclass\fB\fR
Specifies the DNS class of the key sets.
.TP
\fB-s \fIstart-time\fB\fR
Specify the date and time when the generated SIG records
become valid. This can be either an absolute or relative
time. An absolute start time is indicated by a number
in YYYYMMDDHHMMSS notation; 20000530144500 denotes
14:45:00 UTC on May 30th, 2000. A relative start time is
indicated by +N, which is N seconds from the current time.
If no \fBstart-time\fR is specified, the current
time is used.
.TP
\fB-e \fIend-time\fB\fR
Specify the date and time when the generated SIG records
expire. As with \fBstart-time\fR, an absolute
time is indicated in YYYYMMDDHHMMSS notation. A time relative
to the start time is indicated with +N, which is N seconds from
the start time. A time relative to the current time is
indicated with now+N. If no \fBend-time\fR is
specified, 30 days from the start time is used as a default.
.TP
\fB-h\fR
Prints a short summary of the options and arguments to
\fBdnssec-signkey\fR.
.TP
\fB-p\fR
Use pseudo-random data when signing the zone. This is faster,
but less secure, than using real random data. This option
may be useful when signing large zones or when the entropy
source is limited.
.TP
\fB-r \fIrandomdev\fB\fR
Specifies the source of randomness. If the operating
system does not provide a \fI/dev/random\fR
or equivalent device, the default source of randomness
is keyboard input. \fIrandomdev\fR specifies
the name of a character device or file containing random
data to be used instead of the default. The special value
\fIkeyboard\fR indicates that keyboard
input should be used.
.TP
\fB-v \fIlevel\fB\fR
Sets the debugging level.
.TP
\fBkeyset\fR
The file containing the child's keyset.
.TP
\fBkey\fR
The keys used to sign the child's keyset.
.SH "EXAMPLE"
.PP
The DNS administrator for a DNSSEC-aware \fB.com\fR
zone would use the following command to sign the
\fIkeyset\fR file for \fBexample.com\fR
created by \fBdnssec-makekeyset\fR with a key generated
by \fBdnssec-keygen\fR:
.PP
\fBdnssec-signkey keyset-example.com. Kcom.+003+51944\fR
.PP
In this example, \fBdnssec-signkey\fR creates
the file \fIsignedkey-example.com.\fR, which
contains the \fBexample.com\fR keys and the
signatures by the \fB.com\fR keys.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.PP
\fBdnssec-keygen\fR(8),
\fBdnssec-makekeyset\fR(8),
\fBdnssec-signzone\fR(8).
