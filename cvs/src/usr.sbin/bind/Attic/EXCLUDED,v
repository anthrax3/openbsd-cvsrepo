1007.	[port]		config.guess, config.sub from autoconf-2.52.

1008.	[port]		libtool.m4, ltmain.sh from libtool-1.4.2.

1009.	[port]		OpenUNIX 8 support. [RT #1728]

1011.	[cleanup]	Removed isc_dir_current().

1024.	[port]		Compilation failed on HP-UX 11.11 due to
			incompatible use of the SIOCGLIFCONF macro
			name. [RT #1831]
			[needs more work]

1025.	[bug]		Don't use multicast addresses to resolve iterative
			queries. [RT #101]

1034.	[bug]		Ignore the RD bit on multicast queries as specified
			in RFC 1123. [RT #137]

1035.	[bug]		If we respond to multicast queries (which we
			currently do not), respond from a unicast address
			as specified in RFC 1123. [RT #137]

1037.	[bug]		Negative responses whose authority section contain
			SOA or NS records whose owner names are not equal
			equal to or parents of the query name should be
			rejected. [RT #1862]

1073.	[bug]		The ADB cache cleaning should also be space driven.
			[RT #1915, #1938]
			[ New function dns_adb_setadbsize() ]

1079.	[bug]		BIND 8 compatibility: accept bare elements at top
			level of sort list treating them as if they were
			a single element list. [RT #1963]

1080.	[bug]		BIND 8 compatibility: accept bare IP prefixes
			as the second element of a two-element top level
			sort list statement. [RT #1964]

1105.	[port]		OpenUNIX 8 enable threads by default. [RT #1970]
			[Functional change]

1110.	[bug]		dig should only accept valid abbreviations of +options.
			[RT #2003]
			[Potentially breaks scripts.  Leave to 9.3.0.]

1143.	[bug]		When a trusted-keys statement was present and named
			was built without crypto support, it would leak memory.
			[ Not applicable to 9.2 ]

1150.	[bug]		named incorrectly accepted TTL values
			containing plus or minus signs, such as
			1d+1h-1s.
			[ Uses new function isc_parse_uint32() ]

1151.	[bug]		nslookup failed to check that the arguments to
			the port, timeout, and retry options were
			valid integers and in range. [RT #2099]
			[ Uses new function isc_parse_uint32() ]

1159.	[bug]		MD and MF are not permitted to be loaded by RFC1123
			[ Could cause zones that loaded in 9.2.0 to fail
			to load.  Leave such breakages to 9.3.0. ]

1187.	[bug]		named was incorrectly returning DNSSEC records
			in negative responses when the DO bit was not set.
			[ Requires API change (new argument) to
			dns_rdataset_towire(), dns_rdataset_towirepartial()
			and dns_rdataset_towirepartial() ]

1192.	[bug]		The seconds fields in LOC records were restricted
			to three decimal places.  More decimal places should
			be allowed but warned about.

1209.	[bug]		Dig, host, nslookup were not checking the message ids
			on the responses. [RT #2454]

1224.	[bug]		'rrset-order' and 'sortlist' should be additive
			not exclusive.
			[tightly coupled with 'cyclic' and 'random' support]

1233.	[bug]		The flags field of a KEY record can be expressed in
			hex as well as decimal.
			[ Not applicable to 9.2.x ]

1234.	[bug]		contrib/sdb: 'zonetodb' failed to call
			dns_result_register().  DNS_R_SEENINCLUDE should not
			be fatal.

1243.	[bug]		It was possible to trigger a REQUIRE() in
			dns_message_findtype(). [RT #2659]

1247.	[bug]		Don't reset the interface index for link/site local
			addresses. [RT #2576]
			[depends on new functions]

1255.	[bug]		When verifying that an NXT proves nonexistence, check
			the rcode of the message and only do the matching NXT
			check.  That is, for NXDOMAIN responses, check that
			the name is in the range between the NXT owner and
			next name, and for NOERROR NODATA responses, check
			that the type is not present in the NXT bitmap.
			[required changes from DS support]

1271.	[bug]		"recursion available: {denied,approved}" was too
			confusing.

1321.	[bug]		If the last RRset in a zone is glue, dnssec-signzone
			would incorrectly duplicate its output and sign it.
			[DS specific]

1322.	[bug]		dnssec-signzone usage message was misleading.
			[DS specific]

1328.	[bug]		The validator could incorrectly verify an invalid
			negative proof.
			[DS specific]

1355.	[bug]		Fix DNSSEC wildcard proof for CNAME/DNAME.

1362.	[bug]		remove IFF_RUNNING test when scanning interfaces.

1371.	[bug]		notify-source-v6, transfer-source-v6 and
			query-source-v6 with explicit addresses and using the
			same ports as named was listening on could interfere
			with nameds ability to answer queries sent to those
			addresses.

1386.	[bug]		named-checkzone -z stopped on errors in a zone.
			[RT #3653]

1392.	[bug]		named-checkzone: update usage.

1393.	[port]		Bind to individual IPv6 interfaces if IPV6_IPV6ONLY
			is not available in the kernel to prevent accidently
			listening on IPv4 interfaces.

1398.	[doc]		ARM: notify-also should have been also-notify.
			[RT #4345]

1400.	[bug]		Block the addition of wildcard NS records by IXFR
			or UPDATE. [RT #3502]

1404.	[bug]		libbind: ns_name_ntol() could overwrite a zero length
			buffer.

1409.	[bug]		DS should have attribute DNS_RDATATYPEATTR_DNSSEC.

1430.	[port]		linux: IPv6 interface scanning support.

1433.	[bug]		named could trigger a REQUIRE failure if it could
			not get a file descriptor when attempting to write
			a master file. [RT #4347]

1454.	[port]		Use getifaddrs() if available for interface scanning.
			--disable-getifaddrs to override.  Glibc currently
			has a getifaddrs() that does not support IPv6.
			Use --enable-getifaddrs=glibc to force the use of
			this version under linux machines.
