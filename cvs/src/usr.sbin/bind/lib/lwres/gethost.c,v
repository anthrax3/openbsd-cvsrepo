/**
 *    These functions provide hostname-to-address and address-to-hostname
 *    lookups by means of the lightweight resolver. They are similar to the
 *    standard gethostent(3) functions provided by most operating systems.
 *    They use a struct hostent which is usually defined in <namedb.h>.
 * 
 * \code
 * struct  hostent {
 *         char    *h_name;        // official name of host
 * 	   char    **h_aliases;    // alias list
 *         int     h_addrtype;     // host address type
 *         int     h_length;       // length of address
 *         char    **h_addr_list;  // list of addresses from name server
 * };
 * #define h_addr  h_addr_list[0]  // address, for backward compatibility
 * \endcode
 * 
 *    The members of this structure are:
 * 
 * \li   h_name:
 *           The official (canonical) name of the host.
 * 
 * \li   h_aliases:
 *           A NULL-terminated array of alternate names (nicknames) for the
 *           host.
 * 
 * \li   h_addrtype:
 *           The type of address being returned -- PF_INET or PF_INET6.
 * 
 * \li   h_length:
 *           The length of the address in bytes.
 * 
 * \li   h_addr_list:
 *           A NULL terminated array of network addresses for the host. Host
 *           addresses are returned in network byte order.
 * 
 *    For backward compatibility with very old software, h_addr is the first
 *    address in h_addr_list.
 * 
 *    lwres_gethostent(), lwres_sethostent(), lwres_endhostent(),
 *    lwres_gethostent_r(), lwres_sethostent_r() and lwres_endhostent_r()
 *    provide iteration over the known host entries on systems that provide
 *    such functionality through facilities like /etc/hosts or NIS. The
 *    lightweight resolver does not currently implement these functions; it
 *    only provides them as stub functions that always return failure.
 * 
 *    lwres_gethostbyname() and lwres_gethostbyname2() look up the hostname
 *    name. lwres_gethostbyname() always looks for an IPv4 address while
 *    lwres_gethostbyname2() looks for an address of protocol family af:
 *    either PF_INET or PF_INET6 -- IPv4 or IPV6 addresses respectively.
 *    Successful calls of the functions return a struct hostent for the name
 *    that was looked up. NULL is returned if the lookups by
 *    lwres_gethostbyname() or lwres_gethostbyname2() fail.
 * 
 *    Reverse lookups of addresses are performed by lwres_gethostbyaddr().
 *    addr is an address of length len bytes and protocol family type --
 *    PF_INET or PF_INET6. lwres_gethostbyname_r() is a thread-safe function
 *    for forward lookups. If an error occurs, an error code is returned in
 *    *error. resbuf is a pointer to a struct hostent which is initialised
 *    by a successful call to lwres_gethostbyname_r() . buf is a buffer of
 *    length len bytes which is used to store the h_name, h_aliases, and
 *    h_addr_list elements of the struct hostent returned in resbuf.
 *    Successful calls to lwres_gethostbyname_r() return resbuf, which is a
 *    pointer to the struct hostent it created.
 * 
 *    lwres_gethostbyaddr_r() is a thread-safe function that performs a
 *    reverse lookup of address addr which is len bytes long and is of
 *    protocol family type -- PF_INET or PF_INET6. If an error occurs, the
 *    error code is returned in *error. The other function parameters are
 *    identical to those in lwres_gethostbyname_r(). resbuf is a pointer to
 *    a struct hostent which is initialised by a successful call to
 *    lwres_gethostbyaddr_r(). buf is a buffer of length len bytes which is
 *    used to store the h_name, h_aliases, and h_addr_list elements of the
 *    struct hostent returned in resbuf. Successful calls to
 *    lwres_gethostbyaddr_r() return resbuf, which is a pointer to the
 *    struct hostent it created.
 * 
 * \section gethost_return Return Values
 * 
 *    The functions lwres_gethostbyname(), lwres_gethostbyname2(),
 *    lwres_gethostbyaddr(), and lwres_gethostent() return NULL to indicate
 *    an error. In this case the global variable lwres_h_errno will contain
 *    one of the following error codes defined in \link netdb.h <lwres/netdb.h>:\endlink
 * 
 * \li #HOST_NOT_FOUND:
 *           The host or address was not found.
 * 
 * \li #TRY_AGAIN:
 *           A recoverable error occurred, e.g., a timeout. Retrying the
 *           lookup may succeed.
 * 
 * \li #NO_RECOVERY:
 *           A non-recoverable error occurred.
 * 
 * \li #NO_DATA:
 *           The name exists, but has no address information associated with
 *           it (or vice versa in the case of a reverse lookup). The code
 *           NO_ADDRESS is accepted as a synonym for NO_DATA for backwards
 *           compatibility.
 * 
 *    lwres_hstrerror() translates these error codes to suitable error
 *    messages.
 * 
 *    lwres_gethostent() and lwres_gethostent_r() always return NULL.
 * 
 *    Successful calls to lwres_gethostbyname_r() and
 *    lwres_gethostbyaddr_r() return resbuf, a pointer to the struct hostent
 *    that was initialised by these functions. They return NULL if the
 *    lookups fail or if buf was too small to hold the list of addresses and
 *    names referenced by the h_name, h_aliases, and h_addr_list elements of
 *    the struct hostent. If buf was too small, both lwres_gethostbyname_r()
 *    and lwres_gethostbyaddr_r() set the global variable errno to ERANGE.
 * 
 * \section gethost_see See Also
 * 
 *    gethostent(), \link getipnode.c getipnode\endlink, lwres_hstrerror()
 * 
 * \section gethost_bugs Bugs
 * 
 *    lwres_gethostbyname(), lwres_gethostbyname2(), lwres_gethostbyaddr()
 *    and lwres_endhostent() are not thread safe; they return pointers to
 *    static data and provide error codes through a global variable.
 *    Thread-safe versions for name and address lookup are provided by
 *    lwres_gethostbyname_r(), and lwres_gethostbyaddr_r() respectively.
 * 
 *    The resolver daemon does not currently support any non-DNS name
 *    services such as /etc/hosts or NIS, consequently the above functions
 *    don't, either.

 *    such functionality through facilities like /etc/hosts or NIS. The
 *    lightweight resolver does not currently implement these functions; it
 *    only provides them as stub functions that always return failure.
 * 
 *    lwres_gethostbyname() and lwres_gethostbyname2() look up the hostname
 *    name. lwres_gethostbyname() always looks for an IPv4 address while
 *    lwres_gethostbyname2() looks for an address of protocol family af:
 *    either PF_INET or PF_INET6 -- IPv4 or IPV6 addresses respectively.
 *    Successful calls of the functions return a struct hostent for the name
 *    that was looked up. NULL is returned if the lookups by
 *    lwres_gethostbyname() or lwres_gethostbyname2() fail.
 * 
 *    Reverse lookups of addresses are performed by lwres_gethostbyaddr().
 *    addr is an address of length len bytes and protocol family type --
 *    PF_INET or PF_INET6. lwres_gethostbyname_r() is a thread-safe function
 *    for forward lookups. If an error occurs, an error code is returned in
 *    *error. resbuf is a pointer to a struct hostent which is initialised
 *    by a successful call to lwres_gethostbyname_r() . buf is a buffer of
 *    length len bytes which is used to store the h_name, h_aliases, and
 *    h_addr_list elements of the struct hostent returned in resbuf.
 *    Successful calls to lwres_gethostbyname_r() return resbuf, which is a
 *    pointer to the struct hostent it created.
 * 
 *    lwres_gethostbyaddr_r() is a thread-safe function that performs a
 *    reverse lookup of address addr which is len bytes long and is of
 *    protocol family type -- PF_INET or PF_INET6. If an error occurs, the
 *    error code is returned in *error. The other function parameters are
 *    identical to those in lwres_gethostbyname_r(). resbuf is a pointer to
 *    a struct hostent which is initialised by a successful call to
 *    lwres_gethostbyaddr_r(). buf is a buffer of length len bytes which is
 *    used to store the h_name, h_aliases, and h_addr_list elements of the
 *    struct hostent returned in resbuf. Successful calls to
 *    lwres_gethostbyaddr_r() return resbuf, which is a pointer to the
 *    struct hostent it created.

 * \section gethost_return Return Values
 * 
 *    The functions lwres_gethostbyname(), lwres_gethostbyname2(),
 *    lwres_gethostbyaddr(), and lwres_gethostent() return NULL to indicate
 *    an error. In this case the global variable lwres_h_errno will contain
 *    one of the following error codes defined in \link netdb.h <lwres/netdb.h>:\endlink
 * 
 * \li #HOST_NOT_FOUND:
 *           The host or address was not found.
 * 
 * \li #TRY_AGAIN:
 *           A recoverable error occurred, e.g., a timeout. Retrying the
 *           lookup may succeed.
 * 
 * \li #NO_RECOVERY:
 *           A non-recoverable error occurred.
 * 
 * \li #NO_DATA:
 *           The name exists, but has no address information associated with
 *           it (or vice versa in the case of a reverse lookup). The code
 *           NO_ADDRESS is accepted as a synonym for NO_DATA for backwards
 *           compatibility.
 * 
 *    lwres_hstrerror() translates these error codes to suitable error
 *    messages.
 * 
 *    lwres_gethostent() and lwres_gethostent_r() always return NULL.
 * 
 *    Successful calls to lwres_gethostbyname_r() and
 *    lwres_gethostbyaddr_r() return resbuf, a pointer to the struct hostent
 *    that was initialised by these functions. They return NULL if the
 *    lookups fail or if buf was too small to hold the list of addresses and
 *    names referenced by the h_name, h_aliases, and h_addr_list elements of
 *    the struct hostent. If buf was too small, both lwres_gethostbyname_r()
 *    and lwres_gethostbyaddr_r() set the global variable errno to ERANGE.

 * \section gethost_bugs Bugs
 * 
 *    lwres_gethostbyname(), lwres_gethostbyname2(), lwres_gethostbyaddr()
 *    and lwres_endhostent() are not thread safe; they return pointers to
 *    static data and provide error codes through a global variable.
 *    Thread-safe versions for name and address lookup are provided by
 *    lwres_gethostbyname_r(), and lwres_gethostbyaddr_r() respectively.
 * 
 *    The resolver daemon does not currently support any non-DNS name
 *    services such as /etc/hosts or NIS, consequently the above functions
 *    don't, either.
