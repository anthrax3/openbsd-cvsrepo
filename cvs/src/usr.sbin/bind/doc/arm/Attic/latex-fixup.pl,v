# Sadly, the final stages of generating a presentable PDF file always
# seem to require some manual tweaking.  Doesn't seem to matter what
# typesetting tool one uses, sane forms of automation only go so far,
# at least with present technology.
#
# This script is intended to be a collection of tweaks.  The theory is
# that, while we can't avoid the need for tweaking, we can at least
# write the silly things down in a form that a program might be able
# to execute.  Undoubtedly everythig in here will break, eventually,
# at which point it will need to be updated, but since the alternative
# is to do the final editing by hand every time, this approach seems
# the lesser of two evils.

while (<>) {

    # At the moment, the only tweak we have is fixup for a db2latex
    # oops.  LaTeX2e does not like having tables with duplicate names.
    # Perhaps the dblatex project will fix this someday, but we can
    # get by with just deleting the offending LaTeX commands for now.
