@this commit is really florian@@'s, since he's the one who made removal
of our forked apache possible by his work on nginx and slowcgi, but he
doesn't want it - so it is my pleasure to tedu it. I spent so much work
on chroot in it 10 years ago - and am very happy to see it go now, nginx
is a far better choice today.
Bye bye, Apache, won't miss you.

@Add support for IPv6 while keeping the default at IPv4 to not break
existing installations.  See the documentation for the IPv6 related
configuration.

This changes the module ABI since addresses are now struct addrinfo.

This has been tested by many people and run on production machines
for several months.

feedback many, ok todd
