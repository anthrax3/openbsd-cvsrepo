@this commit is really florian@@'s, since he's the one who made removal
of our forked apache possible by his work on nginx and slowcgi, but he
doesn't want it - so it is my pleasure to tedu it. I spent so much work
on chroot in it 10 years ago - and am very happy to see it go now, nginx
is a far better choice today.
Bye bye, Apache, won't miss you.

/* pools have nested lifetimes -- sub_pools are destroyed when the
 * parent pool is cleared.  We allow certain liberties with operations
 * on things such as tables (and on other structures in a more general
 * sense) where we allow the caller to insert values into a table which
 * were not allocated from the table's pool.  The table's data will
 * remain valid as long as all the pools from which its values are
 * allocated remain valid.
 *
 * For example, if B is a sub pool of A, and you build a table T in
 * pool B, then it's safe to insert data allocated in A or B into T
 * (because B lives at most as long as A does, and T is destroyed when
 * B is cleared/destroyed).  On the other hand, if S is a table in
 * pool A, it is safe to insert data allocated in A into S, but it
 * is *not safe* to insert data allocated from B into S... because
 * B can be cleared/destroyed before A is (which would leave dangling
 * pointers in T's data structures).
 *
 * In general we say that it is safe to insert data into a table T
 * if the data is allocated in any ancestor of T's pool.  This is the
 * basis on which the POOL_DEBUG code works -- it tests these ancestor
 * relationships for all data inserted into tables.  POOL_DEBUG also
 * provides tools (ap_find_pool, and ap_pool_is_ancestor) for other
 * folks to implement similar restrictions for their own data
 * structures.
 *
 * However, sometimes this ancestor requirement is inconvenient --
 * sometimes we're forced to create a sub pool (such as through
 * ap_sub_req_lookup_uri), and the sub pool is guaranteed to have
 * the same lifetime as the parent pool.  This is a guarantee implemented
 * by the *caller*, not by the pool code.  That is, the caller guarantees
 * they won't destroy the sub pool individually prior to destroying the
 * parent pool.
 *
 * In this case the caller must call ap_pool_join() to indicate this
 * guarantee to the POOL_DEBUG code.  There are a few examples spread
 * through the standard modules.
