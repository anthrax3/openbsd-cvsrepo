@this commit is really florian@@'s, since he's the one who made removal
of our forked apache possible by his work on nginx and slowcgi, but he
doesn't want it - so it is my pleasure to tedu it. I spent so much work
on chroot in it 10 years ago - and am very happy to see it go now, nginx
is a far better choice today.
Bye bye, Apache, won't miss you.

.Dt DBMMANAGE 1
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm dbmmanage
.Nd create and update user authentication files in DBM format
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Ar filename
.Op Ar command
.Op Ar username Op Ar encpassword
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is used to create and update the DBM format files used to store
usernames and passwords for basic authentication of HTTP users.
Resources available from the
.Xr httpd 8
Apache web server can be restricted to just the users listed
in the files created by
.Nm .
This program can only be used when the usernames are stored in a DBM file.
To use a flat-file database see
.Xr htpasswd 1 .
.Pp
This manual page only lists the command line arguments.
For details of the directives necessary to configure user authentication in
.Xr httpd 8 ,
see
the Apache manual, which can be found in
.Pa /usr/share/doc/html/httpd/ .
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width "encpasswordXX"
.It Ar command
This selects the operation to perform:
.Bl -tag -width "adduserXX"
.It Ic add
Add an entry for
.Ar username
to
.Ar filename
using the encrypted password
.Ar encpassword .
.It Ic adduser
Ask for a password and then add an entry for
.Ar username
to
.Ar filename .
.It Ic check
Ask for a password and then check if
.Ar username
is in
.Ar filename
and if its password matches the specified one.
.It Ic delete
Delete the
.Ar username
entry from
.Ar filename .
.It Ic import
Read username:password entries (one per line) from stdin and add them to
.Ar filename .
The password already has to be encrypted.
.It Ic update
Same as the
.Ic adduser
command, except that it makes sure
.Ar username
already exists in
.Ar filename .
.It Ic view
Just display the complete contents of the DBM file.
.El
.It Ar encpassword
The password to be encrypted.
.It Ar filename
The filename of the DBM format file.
Usually without the extension .db, .pag, or .dir.
.It Ar username
The user for which the update operation is performed.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr htdigest 1 ,
.Xr htpasswd 1 ,
.Xr httpd 8
.Sh BUGS
One should be aware that there are a number of different DBM file
formats in existence, and with all likelihood, libraries for more than
one format may exist on your system.
The three primary examples are NDBM, the GNU project's GDBM,
and Berkeley DB 2.
Unfortunately, all these libraries use different file formats,
and you must make sure that the file format used by
.Ar filename
is the same format that
.Nm
expects to see.
.Nm
currently has no way of determining what type of DBM file it is
looking at.
If used against the wrong format,
.Nm
will simply return nothing, or may create a different DBM file with a
different name, or at worst, it may corrupt the DBM file if you were
attempting to write to it.
.Pp
.Nm
has a list of DBM format preferences, defined by the
.Dq @@AnyDBM::ISA
array near the beginning of the program.
Since we prefer the Berkeley DB 2 file format, the order in which
.Nm
will look for system libraries is Berkeley DB 2, then NDBM, and then GDBM.
The first library found will be the library
.Nm
will attempt to use for all DBM file transactions.
This ordering is slightly different than the standard
.Dq @@AnyDBM::ISA
ordering in
.Xr perl 1 ,
as well as the ordering used by the simple
.Fn dbmopen
call in perl,
so if you use any other utilities to manage your DBM files,
they must also follow this preference ordering.
Similar care must be taken if using programs in other languages,
like C,
to access these files.
.Pp
.Xr httpd 8 Ns 's
.Pa mod_auth_db.c
module corresponds to the Berkeley DB 2 library, while
.Pa mod_auth_dbm.c
corresponds to the NDBM library.
Also, one can usually use the
.Xr file 1
program supplied with most
.Ux
systems to see what format a DBM file is in.

One should be aware that there are a number of different DBM file
formats in existance, and with all likelihood, libraries for more than
one format may exist on your system.  The three primary examples are
NDBM, the GNU project's GDBM, and Berkeley DB 2.  Unfortunately, all
these libraries use different file formats, and you must make sure
that the file format used by
.I filename
is the same format that 
.B dbmmanage
expects to see.  
.B dbmmanage
currently has no way of determining what type of DBM file it is
looking at.  If used against the wrong format, 
.dbmmanage
will simply return nothing, or may create a different DBM file with a
different name, or at worst, it may corrupt the DBM file if you were
attempting to write to it.
.PP
.B dbmmanage
has a list of DBM format preferences, defined by the 
.B @@AnyDBM::ISA
array near the beginning of the program.  Since we prefer the Berkeley
DB 2 file format, the order in which
.B dbmmanage 
will look for system libraries is Berkeley DB 2, then NDBM, and then
GDBM.  The first library found will be the library
.B dbmmanage
will attempt to use for all DBM file transactions.  This ordering is
slightly different than the standard 
.B @@AnyDBM::ISA
ordering in perl, as well as the ordering used by the simple dbmopen()
call in Perl, so if you use any other utilities to manage your DBM
files, they must also follow this preference ordering.  Similar care
must be taken if using programs in other languages, like C, to 
access these files.
.PP
Apache's 
.B mod_auth_db.c 
module corresponds to Berkeley DB 2 library, while
.B mod_auth_dbm.c
corresponds to the NDBM library.  Also, one can usually use the 
.B file
program supplied with most Unix systems to see what format a DBM file is in.
