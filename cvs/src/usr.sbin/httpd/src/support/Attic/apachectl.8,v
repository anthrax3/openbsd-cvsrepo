@this commit is really florian@@'s, since he's the one who made removal
of our forked apache possible by his work on nginx and slowcgi, but he
doesn't want it - so it is my pleasure to tedu it. I spent so much work
on chroot in it 10 years ago - and am very happy to see it go now, nginx
is a far better choice today.
Bye bye, Apache, won't miss you.

.Sh NAME
.Nm apachectl
.Nd Apache HTTP server control interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Ar command
.Op Ar ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a front end to the Apache HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) server.
It is designed to help the administrator control the
functioning of the Apache
.Xr httpd 8
daemon.
.Pp
.Ar command
can be any one or more of the following options:
.Bl -tag -width "configtestXX"
.It Ic configtest
Run a configuration file syntax test.
It parses the configuration files and either reports
.Dq Syntax OK
or detailed information about the particular syntax error.
.It Ic fullstatus
Display a full status report from
.Dq mod_status .
For this to work, you need to have mod_status enabled on your server
and a text-based browser such as
.Xr lynx 1
available on your system.
The URL used to access the status report can be set by editing the
.Dv STATUSURL
variable in the
.Nm
script.
.It Ic graceful
Gracefully restart
.Xr httpd 8
by sending it a
.Dv SIGUSR1 .
If the daemon is not running, it is started.
This differs from a normal restart
in that currently open connections are not aborted.
A side effect is that old log files will not be closed immediately.
This means that if used in a log rotation script,
a substantial delay may be necessary to ensure that
the old log files are closed before processing them.
This command automatically checks the configuration files via
.Ic configtest
before initiating the restart to make sure httpd doesn't die.
.It Ic help
Display a short help message.
.It Ic restart
Restart
.Xr httpd 8
by sending it a
.Dv SIGHUP .
If the daemon is not running, it is started.
This command automatically checks the configuration files via
.Ic configtest
before initiating the restart to make sure
.Xr httpd 8
doesn't die.
If httpd runs chrooted
(default in
.Ox )
and 3rd party modules are loaded,
restart may fail due to path inconsistency.
Completely stop and start the daemon instead.
.It Ic start
Start
.Xr httpd 8 .
If the daemon is already running,
a warning is given and no action is taken.
.It Ic startssl
Start
.Xr httpd 8
with SSL enabled;
see
.Xr ssl 8
for more information.
If the daemon is already running,
a warning is given and no action is taken.
.It Ic status
Display a brief status report.
Similar to the
.Ic fullstatus
option,
except that the list of requests currently being served is omitted.
.It Ic stop
Stop
.Xr httpd 8 .
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
The exit codes returned are:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "XXX" -offset indent -compact
.It 0
operation completed successfully
.It 2
usage error
.It 3
httpd could not be started
.It 4
httpd could not be stopped
.It 5
httpd could not be started during a restart
.It 6
httpd could not be restarted during a restart
.It 7
httpd could not be restarted during a graceful restart
.It 8
configuration syntax error
.El
.Pp
When multiple arguments are given,
only the error from the last one is reported.
.Sh SEE ALSO
