@this commit is really florian@@'s, since he's the one who made removal
of our forked apache possible by his work on nginx and slowcgi, but he
doesn't want it - so it is my pleasure to tedu it. I spent so much work
on chroot in it 10 years ago - and am very happy to see it go now, nginx
is a far better choice today.
Bye bye, Apache, won't miss you.

@Support files:

ab
	ABuse your server with this benchmarker. Rudimentary
	command line testing tool.

	To compile with SSL support; specify the compile
	time flag 'USE_SSL'. E.g. during configure do:
	
	CFLAGS="-I/usr/local/ssl/include -DUSE_SSL " \
		LIBS="-L/usr/local/ssl/lib -lssl -lcrypt" 
		./configure ...

	SSL support is even more rudimentary and experimental
	than ab itself :-).

apachectl
	Apache run-time Control script. To facilitate the
	administrator and/or your rc.d scripts to control the 
	functioning of the Apache httpd daemon.

apxs
	APache eXtenSion tool. Eases building and installing
	DSO style modules.

dbmmanage
	Create and update user authentication files in the faster
	DBM format used by mod_auth_db.

htdigest
	Create and update user authentication files used in
	DIGEST authentification. See mod_auth_digest.

htpasswd 
	Create and update user authentication files used in
	BASIC authentification. I.e. the htpasswd files.
	See mod_auth.

httpd.8
	General apache man page.

log_server_status
	This script is designed to be run at a frequent interval by something
	like cron.  It connects to the server and downloads the status
	information.  It reformats the information to a single line and logs
	it to a file. 

logresolve
	resolve hostnames for IP-addresses in Apache logfiles

phf_abuse_log.cgi
	This script can be used to detect people trying to abuse an ancient
	and long plugged security hole which existed in a CGI script distributed
	with Apache 1.0.3 and earlier versions.

rotatelogs
	rotate Apache logs without having to kill the server.

split-logfile
	This script will take a combined virtual hosts access
	log file and break its contents into separate files.

suexec
	Switch User For Exec. Used internally by apache, 
        see  the  document  `Apache  suEXEC  Support'
	under http://www.apache.org/docs/suexec.html .

SHA1
	This directory includes some utilities to allow Apache 1.3.6 to 
	recognize passwords in SHA1 format, as used by Netscape web 
	servers. It is not installed by default.
