@this commit is really florian@@'s, since he's the one who made removal
of our forked apache possible by his work on nginx and slowcgi, but he
doesn't want it - so it is my pleasure to tedu it. I spent so much work
on chroot in it 10 years ago - and am very happy to see it go now, nginx
is a far better choice today.
Bye bye, Apache, won't miss you.

.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm rotatelogs
.Ar logfile rotationtime Op Ar offset
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a simple program for use in conjunction with
.Xr httpd 8 Ns 's
piped logfile feature which can be used like this:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
TransferLog "| rotatelogs /path/to/logs/access_log 86400"
.Ed
.Pp
This creates the files
.Pa /path/to/logs/access_log.nnnn
where
.Em nnnn
is the system time at which the log nominally starts (this time will
always be a multiple of the rotation time, so you can synchronize
.Xr cron 8
scripts with it).
At the end of each rotation time (here, after 24 hours), a new log is
started.
.Pp
The arguments are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width rotationtime
.It Ar logfile
The path plus basename of the logfile.
If
.Ar logfile
includes any percent characters
.Pq Sq % ,
it is treated as a format string for
.Xr strftime 3 .
Otherwise, the suffix
.Em .nnnn
is automatically added and is the time at which the logfile was created.
.It Ar rotationtime
The rotation time in seconds.
.It Ar offset
The number of minutes offset from UTC.
If omitted, zero is assumed and UTC is used.
For example, to use local time in the zone UTC \-5 hours, specify a
value of \-300 for this argument.
