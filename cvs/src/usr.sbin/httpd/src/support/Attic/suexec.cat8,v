       ssuueexxeecc is the "wrapper" support  program  for  the  suexec
       behaviour  for  the  Apache  HTTP  server.  It is run from
       within the server automatically to switch the user when an
       external program has to be run under a different user. For
       more information about suexec,  see  the  online  document
       `Apache  suexec  Support' on the HTTP server project's Web
       site at  http://httpd.apache.org/docs/suexec.html .
