@this commit is really florian@@'s, since he's the one who made removal
of our forked apache possible by his work on nginx and slowcgi, but he
doesn't want it - so it is my pleasure to tedu it. I spent so much work
on chroot in it 10 years ago - and am very happy to see it go now, nginx
is a far better choice today.
Bye bye, Apache, won't miss you.

.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm suexec
.Fl V
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is the
.Dq wrapper
support program for the
.Em suexec
behaviour for the Apache
.Xr httpd 8
server.
It is run from within the server automatically to switch the user when
an external program has to be run under a different user.

The options are as follows:

Display the list of compile-time settings used when

was built.
No other action is taken.
.El
.Pp
Because this program is only used internally by
.Xr httpd 8 ,
there are no other ways to directly invoke
.Nm .
.Pp
In order to work correctly,
the
.Nm
binary should be owned by
.Dq root
and have the SETUID execution bit set.
.Ox
currently does not install
.Nm
with the SETUID bit set,
so a change of file mode is necessary to enable it:
