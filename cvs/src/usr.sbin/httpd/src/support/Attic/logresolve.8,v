@this commit is really florian@@'s, since he's the one who made removal
of our forked apache possible by his work on nginx and slowcgi, but he
doesn't want it - so it is my pleasure to tedu it. I spent so much work
on chroot in it 10 years ago - and am very happy to see it go now, nginx
is a far better choice today.
Bye bye, Apache, won't miss you.

To minimize impact on the nameserver,

This means that each IP number will only be looked up the first time it

The following options are supported:

This causes

to apply some DNS checks:
after finding the hostname from the IP address, it looks up the IP
addresses for the hostname and checks that one of them matches the
