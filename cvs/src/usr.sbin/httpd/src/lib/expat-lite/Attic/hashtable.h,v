@this commit is really florian@@'s, since he's the one who made removal
of our forked apache possible by his work on nginx and slowcgi, but he
doesn't want it - so it is my pleasure to tedu it. I spent so much work
on chroot in it 10 years ago - and am very happy to see it go now, nginx
is a far better choice today.
Bye bye, Apache, won't miss you.
