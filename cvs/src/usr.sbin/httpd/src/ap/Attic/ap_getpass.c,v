@this commit is really florian@@'s, since he's the one who made removal
of our forked apache possible by his work on nginx and slowcgi, but he
doesn't want it - so it is my pleasure to tedu it. I spent so much work
on chroot in it 10 years ago - and am very happy to see it go now, nginx
is a far better choice today.
Bye bye, Apache, won't miss you.

@clean up this code. make it conform as closely to KNF as possible without
introducing any binary changes.

two files here have different binary output when the number of lines changes,
we will finish cleaning those in another pass.
