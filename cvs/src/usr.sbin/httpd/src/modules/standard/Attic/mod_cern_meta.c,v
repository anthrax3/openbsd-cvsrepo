@this commit is really florian@@'s, since he's the one who made removal
of our forked apache possible by his work on nginx and slowcgi, but he
doesn't want it - so it is my pleasure to tedu it. I spent so much work
on chroot in it 10 years ago - and am very happy to see it go now, nginx
is a far better choice today.
Bye bye, Apache, won't miss you.

 * mod_cern_meta.c
 * version 0.1.0
 * status beta
 * 
 * Andrew Wilson <Andrew.Wilson@@cm.cf.ac.uk> 25.Jan.96
 *
 * *** IMPORTANT ***
 * This version of mod_cern_meta.c controls Meta File behaviour on a
 * per-directory basis.  Previous versions of the module defined behaviour
 * on a per-server basis.  The upshot is that you'll need to revisit your 
 * configuration files in order to make use of the new module.
 * ***
 *
 * Emulate the CERN HTTPD Meta file semantics.  Meta files are HTTP
 * headers that can be output in addition to the normal range of
 * headers for each file accessed.  They appear rather like the Apache
 * .asis files, and are able to provide a crude way of influencing
 * the Expires: header, as well as providing other curiosities.
 * There are many ways to manage meta information, this one was
 * chosen because there is already a large number of CERN users
 * who can exploit this module.  It should be noted that there are probably
 * more sensitive ways of managing the Expires: header specifically.
 *
 * The module obeys the following directives, which can appear 
 * in the server's .conf files and in .htaccess files.
 *
 *  MetaFiles <on|off> 
 *
 *    turns on|off meta file processing for any directory.  
 *    Default value is off
 *
 *        # turn on MetaFiles in this directory
 *        MetaFiles on
 *
 *  MetaDir <directory name>
 *      
 *    specifies the name of the directory in which Apache can find
 *    meta information files.  The directory is usually a 'hidden'
 *    subdirectory of the directory that contains the file being
 *    accessed.  eg:
 *
 *        # .meta files are in the *same* directory as the 
 *        # file being accessed
 *        MetaDir .
 *
 *    the default is to look in a '.web' subdirectory. This is the
 *    same as for CERN 3.+ webservers and behaviour is the same as 
 *    for the directive:
 *
 *        MetaDir .web
 *
 *  MetaSuffix <meta file suffix>
 *
 *    specifies the file name suffix for the file containing the
 *    meta information.  eg:
 *
 *       # our meta files are suffixed with '.cern_meta'
 *       MetaSuffix .cern_meta
 *
 *    the default is to look for files with the suffix '.meta'.  This
 *    behaviour is the same as for the directive:
 *
 *       MetaSuffix .meta
 *
 * When accessing the file
 *
 *   DOCUMENT_ROOT/somedir/index.html
 *
 * this module will look for the file
 *
 *   DOCUMENT_ROOT/somedir/.web/index.html.meta
 *
 * and will use its contents to generate additional MIME header 
 * information.
 *
 * For more information on the CERN Meta file semantics see:
 *
 *   http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/Daemon/User/Config/General.html#MetaDir
 *
 * Change-log:
 * 29.Jan.96 pfopen/pfclose instead of fopen/fclose
 *           DECLINE when real file not found, we may be checking each
 *           of the index.html/index.shtml/index.htm variants and don't
 *           need to report missing ones as spurious errors. 
 * 31.Jan.96 log_error reports about a malformed .meta file, rather
 *           than a script error.
 * 20.Jun.96 MetaFiles <on|off> default off, added, so that module
 *           can be configured per-directory.  Prior to this the module
 *           was running for each request anywhere on the server, naughty..
 * 29.Jun.96 All directives made per-directory.
