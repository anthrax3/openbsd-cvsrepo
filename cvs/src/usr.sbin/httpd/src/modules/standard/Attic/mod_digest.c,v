@this commit is really florian@@'s, since he's the one who made removal
of our forked apache possible by his work on nginx and slowcgi, but he
doesn't want it - so it is my pleasure to tedu it. I spent so much work
on chroot in it 10 years ago - and am very happy to see it go now, nginx
is a far better choice today.
Bye bye, Apache, won't miss you.

     *   quoted-string	 	section 2.2 of RFC 2068
     *   --> We also acccept unquoted strings or strings
     *       like foo" bar". And take a space, comma or EOL as
     *       the terminator in that case.
     *
     *   request-uri		section 5.1 of RFC 2068
     *   --> We currently also accept any quoted string - and
     *       ignore those quotes.
     *
     *   response/entity-digest
     *   --> We ignore the presense of the " if any.
     *
     * Note: There is an inherent problem with the request URI; as it should
     *       be used unquoted - yet may contain a ',' - which is used as
     *       a terminator:       
     *       Authorization: Digest username="dirkx", realm="DAV", nonce="1031662894",
     *       uri=/mary,+dirkx,+peter+and+mary.ics, response="99a6275793be28c31a5b6e4467fa4c79",
     *       algorithm=MD5
     *
     * Note3: Taken from section 3.2.1 - as this is not actually defined in section 3.2.2 
     *       which deals with the Authorization Request Header.
     *
     * Note4: The 'comma separated' list concept is refered to in the RFC
     *       but whitespace eating and other such things are assumed to be
     *       as per MIME/RFC2068 spec.

     * digest-uri         = "uri" "=" digest-uri-value

     * response           = "response" "=" response-digest
     *   response-digest  = <"> *LHEX <">
     *     LHEX           = "0" | "1" | "2" | "3" | "4" | "5" | "6" | "7" |
     *                      "8" | "9" | "a" | "b" | "c" | "d" | "e" | "f"
     * 
     * Current Discrepancies:
     *   quoted-string	 	section 2.2 of RFC 2068
     *   --> We also acccept unquoted strings or strings
     *       like foo" bar". And take a space, comma or EOL as
     *       the terminator in that case.
     *
     *   request-uri		section 5.1 of RFC 2068
     *   --> We currently also accept any quoted string - and
     *       ignore those quotes.
     *
     *   response/entity-digest
     *   --> We ignore the presense of the " if any.
     *
     * Note: * - not yet for  CHARSET_EBCDIC XXXX
     *
     * Note: There is an inherent problem with the request URI; as it should
     *       be used unquoted - yet may contain a ',' - which is used as
     *       a terminator:       
     *       Authorization: Digest username="dirkx", realm="DAV", nonce="1031662894",
     *       uri=/mary,+dirkx,+peter+and+mary.ics, response="99a6275793be28c31a5b6e4467fa4c79",
     *       algorithm=MD5
     *
     * Note3: Taken from section 3.2.1 - as this is not actually defined in section 3.2.2 
     *       which deals with the Authorization Request Header.
     *
     * Note4: The 'comma separated' list concept is refered to in the RFC
     *       but whitespace eating and other such things are assumed to be
     *       as per MIME/RFC2068 spec.
