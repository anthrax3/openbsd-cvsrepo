@this commit is really florian@@'s, since he's the one who made removal
of our forked apache possible by his work on nginx and slowcgi, but he
doesn't want it - so it is my pleasure to tedu it. I spent so much work
on chroot in it 10 years ago - and am very happy to see it go now, nginx
is a far better choice today.
Bye bye, Apache, won't miss you.

 * Rob McCool & Brian Behlendorf.
 * 
 * Adapted to Apache by rst.
 *
 * Version 0.5 May 1996
 *
 * Modified by Dirk.vanGulik@@jrc.it to
 * 
 * Adapted to allow anonymous logins, just like with Anon-FTP, when
 * one gives the magic user name 'anonymous' and ones email address
 * as the password.
 *
 * Just add the following tokes to your <directory> setup:
 * 
 * Anonymous                    magic-user-id [magic-user-id]...
 *
 * Anonymous_MustGiveEmail      [ on | off ] default = on
 * Anonymous_LogEmail           [ on | off ] default = on
 * Anonymous_VerifyEmail        [ on | off ] default = off
 * Anonymous_NoUserId           [ on | off ] default = off
 * Anonymous_Authoritative      [ on | off ] default = off
 *
 * The magic user id is something like 'anonymous', it is NOT case sensitive. 
 * 
 * The MustGiveEmail flag can be used to force users to enter something
 * in the password field (like an email address). Default is on.
 *
 * Furthermore the 'NoUserID' flag can be set to allow completely empty
 * usernames in as well; this can be is convenient as a single return
 * in broken GUIs like W95 is often given by the user. The Default is off.
