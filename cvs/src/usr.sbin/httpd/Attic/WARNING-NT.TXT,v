WARNING: The Win32 release of Apache should 
still be considered beta quality code.  
It does not meet the normal standards of 
stability and security that Unix releases do.  
There are numerous known bugs and 
inconsistencies.  There is also a much 
greater chance of security holes being 
present in the Win32 version of Apache.
