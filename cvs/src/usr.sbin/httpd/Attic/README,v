@this commit is really florian@@'s, since he's the one who made removal
of our forked apache possible by his work on nginx and slowcgi, but he
doesn't want it - so it is my pleasure to tedu it. I spent so much work
on chroot in it 10 years ago - and am very happy to see it go now, nginx
is a far better choice today.
Bye bye, Apache, won't miss you.

                             Version 1.3 (and up)

  What is it?
  -----------

  Apache is an HTTP server designed as a plug-in replacement for
  the NCSA server version 1.3 (or 1.4). It fixes numerous bugs in
  the NCSA server and includes many frequently requested new
  features, and has an API which allows it to be extended to meet
  users' needs more easily.

  The Latest Version
  ------------------

  Details of the latest version can be found on the Apache HTTP
  server project page under http://httpd.apache.org/.

  Documentation
  -------------

  The documentation available as of the date of this release is
  also included, in HTML format, in the htdocs/manual/ directory.
  For the most up-to-date documentation can be found on
  http://httpd.apache.org/docs/.

  Installation
  ------------

  From Apache version 1.3 and up you have two possibilities to
  build and install the Apache package: The old commonly known
  but manual way from Apache 1.2 and below and the new
  out-of-the-box way through the new Apache Autoconf-style
  Interface (APACI). For detailed instructions see the file
  INSTALL in this directory.

                             Version 1.2 (and up)

What is it?
-----------

Apache is an HTTP server designed as a plug-in replacement for the NCSA
server version 1.3 (or 1.4). It fixes numerous bugs in the NCSA server and
includes many frequently requested new features, and has an API which
allows it to be extended to meet users' needs more easily.

Documentation
-------------

The documentation available as of the date of this release is also
included, in HTML format, in the htdocs/manual/ directory. For the
most up-to-date documentation, visit us on the WWW, at
<URL:http://www.apache.org/>.

Installation
------------

Unless you grabbed a binary distribution of Apache, you must compile
it for your specific platform.  In order to compile it, you must set
compile-time options (in particular, system type) for your system by
editing a Configuration file, run a script which generates a Makefile
and a small piece of C code, and then compile it.
d5 2
a6 1
For instructions on compilation, see the file 'INSTALL' in the src/ directory.
d8 5
a12 3
After compilation, you will have a binary called "httpd" in the src/
directory.  If you received a binary distribution of apache, you
should have this file already.
d14 2
a15 5
The next step is to edit the configuration files for the server.  In
the subdirectory called "conf" you should find distribution versions
of the three configuration files: srm.conf-dist, access.conf-dist, and
httpd.conf-dist.  Copy them to srm.conf, access.conf, httpd.conf
respectively.
d17 2
a18 7
First edit httpd.conf.  This sets up general attributes about the
server - the port number, the user it runs as, etc.  Next edit the
srm.conf file - this sets up the root of the document tree, special
functions like server-parsed HTML or internal imagemap parsing, etc.
Finally, edit the access.conf file to at least set the base cases of
access. Documentation for all of these is located at
<URL:http://www.apache.org/docs/>.
d20 2
a21 2
Finally, make a call to httpd, with a -f to the full path to the
httpd.conf file.  I.e., the common case:
d23 4
a26 1
  /usr/local/etc/apache/src/httpd -f /usr/local/etc/apache/conf/httpd.conf
d28 2
a29 1
And voila!  The server should be running.
d31 6
a36 3
By default the srm.conf and access.conf files are located by name - to
specifically call them by other names, use the AccessConfig and
ResourceConfig directives in httpd.conf.
