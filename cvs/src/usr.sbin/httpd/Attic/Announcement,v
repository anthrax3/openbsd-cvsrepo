@this commit is really florian@@'s, since he's the one who made removal
of our forked apache possible by his work on nginx and slowcgi, but he
doesn't want it - so it is my pleasure to tedu it. I spent so much work
on chroot in it 10 years ago - and am very happy to see it go now, nginx
is a far better choice today.
Bye bye, Apache, won't miss you.

                   Apache HTTP Server 1.3.29 Released

   The Apache Software Foundation and The Apache HTTP Server Project are
   pleased to announce the release of version 1.3.29 of the Apache HTTP
   Server ("Apache").  This Announcement notes the significant changes
   in 1.3.29 as compared to 1.3.28.  The Announcement is also available
   in German from http://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/Announcement.html.de.

   This version of Apache is principally a bug and security fix release.
   A partial summary of the bug fixes is given at the end of this document.
   A full listing of changes can be found in the CHANGES file.  Of
   particular note is that 1.3.29 addresses and fixes 1 potential
   security issue:

     o CAN-2003-0542 (cve.mitre.org)
       Fix buffer overflows in mod_alias and mod_rewrite which occurred if
       one configured a regular expression with more than 9 captures.

   We consider Apache 1.3.29 to be the best version of Apache 1.3 available
   and we strongly recommend that users of older versions, especially of
   the 1.1.x and 1.2.x family, upgrade as soon as possible.  No further
   releases will be made in the 1.2.x family.

   Apache 1.3.29 is available for download from:
   
       http://httpd.apache.org/download.cgi

   This service utilizes the network of mirrors listed at:

       http://www.apache.org/mirrors/

   Please consult the CHANGES_1.3 file for a full list of changes.

   As of Apache 1.3.12 binary distributions contain all standard Apache
   modules as shared objects (if supported by the platform) and include
   full source code.  Installation is easily done by executing the
   included install script.  See the README.bindist and INSTALL.bindist
   files for a complete explanation.  Please note that the binary
   distributions are only provided for your convenience and current
   distributions for specific platforms are not always available.  Win32
   binary distributions are based on the Microsoft Installer (.MSI)
   technology.  While development continues to make this installation method
   more robust, questions should be directed to the
   news:comp.infosystems.www.servers.ms-windows newsgroup.

   For an overview of new features introduced after 1.2 please see
   
   http://httpd.apache.org/docs/new_features_1_3.html

   In general, Apache 1.3 offers several substantial improvements over
   version 1.2, including better performance, reliability and a wider
   range of supported platforms, including Windows NT and 2000 (which
   fall under the "Win32" label), OS2, Netware, and TPF threaded
   platforms.

   Apache is the most popular web server in the known universe; over half
   of the servers on the Internet are running Apache or one of its
   variants.

   IMPORTANT NOTE FOR APACHE USERS:   Apache 1.3 was designed for Unix OS
   variants.  While the ports to non-Unix platforms (such as Win32, Netware
   or OS2) are of an acceptable quality, Apache 1.3 is not optimized for
   these platforms.  Security, stability, or performance issues on these
   non-Unix ports do not generally apply to the Unix version, due to
   software's Unix origin.

   Apache 2.0 has been structured for multiple operating systems from its 
   inception, by introducing the Apache Portability Library and MPM modules.
   Users on non-Unix platforms are strongly encouraged to move up to 
   Apache 2.0 for better performance, stability and security on their
   platforms.

                     Apache 1.3.29 Major changes

  Security vulnerabilities

     * CAN-2003-0542 (cve.mitre.org)
       Fix buffer overflows in mod_alias and mod_rewrite which occurred if
       one configured a regular expression with more than 9 captures.

  New features

   New features that relate to specific platforms:

     * Enabled RFC1413 ident functionality for both Win32 and
       NetWare platforms.  This also included an alternate thread safe
       implementation of the socket timout functionality when querying
       the identd daemon.

  Bugs fixed

   The following noteworthy bugs were found in Apache 1.3.28 (or earlier)
   and have been fixed in Apache 1.3.29:

     * Within ap_bclose(), ap_pclosesocket() is now called consistently
       for sockets and ap_pclosef() for files.  Also, closesocket()
       is used consistenly to close socket fd's.  The previous
       confusion between socket and file fd's would cause problems
       with some applications now that we proactively close fd's to
       prevent leakage.  PR 22805.
 
     * Fixed mod_usertrack to not get false positive matches on the
       user-tracking cookie's name.  PR 16661.

     * Prevent creation of subprocess Zombies when using CGI wrappers
       such as suEXEC and cgiwrap.  PR 21737.

   The main new features in 1.3.28 (compared to 1.3.27) are:

     * Added new ap_register_cleanup_ex() API function which allows
       for a "magic" cleanup function to be run at register time
       rather than at cleanup time. 

     * Improvements to mod_usertrack that allows for a regular (verbose)
       as well as "compact" version of the tracking cookie (the new
       'CookieFormat' directive), and the ability to prepend a string
       to the cookie via the 'CookiePrefix' directive.

     * Introduce Win32 .pdb diagnostic symbols into the Apache 1.3 build
       (as created in Apache 2.0.45 and later.)  which akes debugging and

       hooks and cleanups.
d106 2
a107 14
     * Fix mod_rewrite's handling of absolute URIs.  The escaping routines
       now work scheme dependent and the query string will only be
       appended if supported by the particular scheme.

     * Prevent obscenely large values of precision in ap_vformatter
       from clobbering a buffer.

     * Update timeout algorithm in free_proc_chain. If a subprocess
       did not exit immediately, the thread would sleep for 3 seconds
       before checking the subprocess exit status again. In a very
       common case when the subprocess was an HTTP server CGI script,
       the CGI script actually exited a fraction of a second into the 3
       second sleep, which effectively limited the server to serving one 
       CGI request every 3 seconds across a persistent connection.

                            Apache 1.3.27 Released
d5 18
a22 21
   pleased to announce the release of version 1.3.27 of the Apache HTTP
   Server.  This Announcement notes the significant changes in 1.3.27
   as compared to 1.3.26.

   This version of Apache is principally a security and bug fix release.
   A summary of the bug fixes is given at the end of this document.
   Of particular note is that 1.3.27 addresses and fixes 3 security
   vulnerabilities.

   CAN-2002-0839 (cve.mitre.org): A vulnerability exists in all versions of
   Apache prior to 1.3.27 on platforms using System V shared memory based
   scoreboards.  This vulnerability allows an attacker who can execute under
   the Apache UID to exploit the Apache shared memory scoreboard format and
   send a signal to any process as root or cause a local denial of service
   attack.  We thank iDefense for their responsible notification and 
   disclosure of this issue.

   CAN-2002-0840 (cve.mitre.org): Apache is susceptible to a cross site
   scripting vulnerability in the default 404 page of any web server hosted
   on a domain that allows wildcard DNS lookups.  We thank Matthew Murphy for
   the responsible notification and disclosure of this issue.
d24 2
a25 5
   CAN-2002-0843 (cve.mitre.org): There were some possible overflows in ab.c
   which could be exploited by a malicious server. Note that this
   vulnerability is not in Apache itself, but rather one of the support
   programs bundled with Apache. We thank David Wagner for the responsible
   notification and disclosure of this issue.

     * Fix the security vulnerability noted in CAN-2002-0839 (cve.mitre.org)
       regarding ownership permissions of System V shared memory based
       scoreboards.  The fix resulted in the new ShmemUIDisUser directive.

     * Fix the security vulnerability noted in CAN-2002-0840 (cvs.mitre.org)
       regarding a cross-site scripting vulnerability in the default error
       page when using wildcard DNS.

     * Fix the security vulnerability noted in CAN-2002-0843 (cve.mitre.org)
       regarding some possible overflows in ab.c which could be exploited by
       a malicious server.
d107 1
a107 6
   The main new features in 1.3.27 (compared to 1.3.26) are:

     * The new ErrorHeader directive has been added.

     * Configuration file globbing can now use simple pattern
       matching.
d109 8
a116 17
     * The protocol version (eg: HTTP/1.1) in the request line parsing
       is now case insensitive.

     * ap_snprintf() can now distinguish between an output which was
       truncated, and an output which exactly filled the buffer.

     * Add ProtocolReqCheck directive, which determines if Apache will
       check for a valid protocol string in the request (eg: HTTP/1.1)
       and return HTTP_BAD_REQUEST if not valid. Versions of Apache
       prior to 1.3.26 would silently ignore bad protocol strings, but
       1.3.26 included a more strict check. This makes it runtime
       configurable.

     * Added support for Berkeley-DB/4.x to mod_auth_db.

     * httpd -V will now also print out the compile time defined
       HARD_SERVER_LIMIT value.
d120 3
a122 3
     * Support Caldera OpenUNIX 8.
     
     * Use SysV semaphores by default on OpenBSD.
d124 2
a125 2
     * Implemented file locking in mod_rewrite for the NetWare
       CLib platform.
d129 5
a133 2
   The following bugs were found in Apache 1.3.26 (or earlier) and have
   been fixed in Apache 1.3.27:
d135 14
a148 15
     * mod_proxy fixes:
        - The cache in mod_proxy was incorrectly updating the Content-Length
          value from 304 responses when doing validation.
        - Fix a problem in proxy where headers from other modules were
          added to the response headers when this was already done in the
          core already.

     * In 1.3.26, a null or all blank Content-Length field would be
       triggered as an error; previous versions would silently ignore
       this and assume 0.  1.3.27 restores this previous behavior.

     * Win32: Fix one byte buffer overflow in ap_get_win32_interpreter
       when a CGI script's #! line does not contain a \r or \n (i.e.
       a line feed character) in the first 1023 bytes. The overflow
       is always a '\0' (string termination) character.

   The following bugs were found in Apache 1.3.24 (or earlier) and have

     * Allow child processes sufficient time for cleanups but making
       ap_select in reclaim_child_processes more "resistant" to
       signal interupts.

     * Fix for a problem in mod_rewrite which would lead to 400 Bad Request
       responses for rewriting rules which resulted in a local path.
       Note: This will also reject invalid requests as issued by
       Netscape-4.x Roaming Profiles (on a DAV-enabled server)

     * Recognize platform-specific root directories (other than
       leading slash) in mod_rewrite for filename rewrite rules.

     * Disallow anything but whitespace on the request line after the
       HTTP/x.y protocol string to prevent arbitrary user input from
       ending up in the access_log and error_log.  Also control characters
       are now escaped.

     * A large number of fixes in mod_proxy including: adding support
       for dechunking chunked responses, correcting a timeout problem
       which would force long or slow POST requests to close after 300
       seconds, adding "X-Forwarded" headers, dealing correctly with the
       multiple-cookie header bug, ability to handle unexpected
       100-continue responses sent during PUT or POST commands, and a
       change to tighten up the Server header overwrite bugfix.

   server. (Version 1.3.18 was not released due to an incorrect fix
   addressing hostnames with url-escaped characters. A corrected fix will
   be included in the next release)
   
   This version of Apache is primarily a security fix release
   addressing a problem which could lead to a directory listing being
   displayed in place of an error message. Also, it fixes some broken
   functionality present in the 1.3.17 release and various Win32 issues.

   The primary security fix is:
     * The default installation could lead mod_negotiation and mod_dir or
       mod_autoindex to display a directory listing instead of the 
       multiview'ed index.html.* files, if a very long path was created 
       artificially by using many slashes.  Now 403 FORBIDDEN is returned.
                                            
   The bug fixes are:
     * The ServerRoot directive now removes trailing slashes.
     * Restore functionality broken by the mod_rewrite security fix:
       The mod_rewrite string arithmetic is corrected for rewrite map.
     * Some possible segfault conditions have been fixed.
     * Under certain circumstances, Apache did not supply the
       right response headers when requiring authentication.
       
   The main new features include:
     * New configuration error reporting if the UserDir argument is set
       to a relative path on Win32 or Netware [which do not support home
       directories], or a relative path on any platform if that path
       includes the '*' username substitution.

   Selected new features that relate to Windows platforms:
     * Apache on Win9x now ensures the service is stopped before removal.
     * Test httpd.conf (-t) now holds the console open on "SYNTAX OK".
     * Apache/Win32 no longer holds open the console on error unless
       it was invoked from a shortcut with the -w option.
     * mod_user was significantly refactored to assure that the UserDir
       directive is parsed effectively the same across platforms, fixing
       a UserDir bug introduced in 1.3.17 on the Win32 platform.
            
   Selected new features relating to other platforms:
     * Netware problems with file extension truncatation are resolved.
     * Netware recognizes the SERVER/VOLUME:/PATH/FILE filename pattern.
     * Netware mod_tls properly disables nagle for SSL connections,
       and properly negotiates SSL based on the port.
     * Startup and Shutdown issues were addressed on TPF.

   The security fixes are:
     * A problem with the Rewrite module, mod_rewrite, allowed access to
       any file on the web server under certain circumstances
     * The handling of Host: headers in mass virtual hosting
       configurations, mod_vhost_alias, could allow access to any file on
       the server
     * If a cgi-bin directory is under the document root, the source to
       the scripts inside it could be sent if using mass virtual hosting
d92 14
a105 31
     * Support for a directory-based configuration system. If any of the
       configuration directives point to directories instead of files,
       all files in that directory (and in subdirectories) will be also
       parsed as configuration files
     * Support name-based virtual hosting without needing to specify an
       IP address in the Apache configuration file. This enables sites
       that use dynamic IP addresses to support name-based virtual
       hosting as well as allowing identical machines to share a
       configuration file, say in a load-balanced cluster
     * The SetEnvIf and BrowserMatch range of directives are now able to
       be used in .htaccess files.
     * Administrators who are nervous about their full server version
       details being public can use the new keyword 'ProductOnly' in the
       ServerTokens directive. This keyword forces the server to only
       return the string "Apache" as the server version.
     * The new digest authentication module, mod_auth_digest has had a
       number of fixes and upgrades applied
       
   Selected new features that relate to windows platforms:
     * The project files have been converted to work with Microsoft
       Visual C 6.0
     * The DBM package "sdbm" is now bundled with Apache
     * Windows 95 and 98 can now benefit from an emulation of the NT
       services, including install and uninstall options. The Apache
       server therefore can start when the OS loads and will not stop if
       the current user logs off for example
     * A comprehensive review of the Windows documentation has been
       performed.
     * Preparations for allowing Apache to be built using the free
       Borland bcc 5.5 compiler
       
d107 5
a111 19
     * Support for the new FreeBSD accept filters feature. This feature
       postpones the requirement for a child process to handle a new
       connection until a HTTP request has arrived, therefore increasing
       the number of connections that a given number of child processes
       can handle
     * A number of alterations for the MPE platform including fixing
       error reporting, updating the DSO code to be compatible with a
       recent OS patch, refining user and group management, and initial
       support for the proxy module
     * The default serialised accept has been changed for AIX 4.3 to
       provide a substantial performance improvement on multiple CPU
       machines serving large numbers of concurrent clients
     * DSO support added for BS2000 and OS/390 USS platforms
     * A directory layout for Solaris 8 has been added to the
       configuration system
     * The proxy module mod_proxy has been patched so that it can be
       built on BeOS 4.5.2
     * Updated configuration script to allow building on IBM's IA-64
       version of AIX

Apache 1.3.12 Released
======================

The Apache Software Foundation and The Apache Server Project are
pleased to announce the release of version 1.3.12 of the Apache HTTP server.

The primary changes in this version of Apache are those related to
the ``cross site scripting'' security alerts described at

   http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2000-02.html
      - and -
   http://www.apache.org/info/css-security/index.html

Specifically, charset handling has been improved and reinforced
(including a new directive: AddDefaultCharset) and server generated
pages properly escape ``userland'' input.

A complete listing with detailed descriptions is provided in the
src/CHANGES file.

We consider Apache 1.3.12 to be the best version of Apache available and
we strongly recommend that users of older versions, especially of the
1.1.x and 1.2.x family, upgrade as soon as possible.  No further releases
will be made in the 1.2.x family.


Apache 1.3.12 is available for download from

    http://www.apache.org/dist/

Please see the CHANGES_1.3 file in the same directory for a full
list of changes.

Binary distributions are available from

   http://www.apache.org/dist/binaries/

As of Apache 1.3.12 binary distributions contain all standard Apache
modules as shared objects (if supported by the platform) and include
full source code.  Installation is easily done by executing the
included install script.  See the README.bindist and INSTALL.bindist
files for a complete explanation.  Please note that the binary
distributions are only provided for your convenience and current
distributions for specific platforms are not always available.

The source and binary distributions are also available via any of the
mirrors listed at

    http://www.apache.org/mirrors/

For an overview of new features in 1.3 please see

    http://www.apache.org/docs/new_features_1_3.html

In general, Apache 1.3 offers several substantial improvements
over version 1.2, including better performance, reliability and a
wider range of supported platforms, including Windows 95/98 and NT
(which fall under the "Win32" label).

Apache is the most popular web server in the known universe; over
half of the servers on the Internet are running Apache or one of
its variants.

IMPORTANT NOTE FOR WIN32 USERS: Over the years, many users have
come to trust Apache as a secure and stable server.  It must
be realized that the current Win32 code has not yet reached the
levels of the Unix version, but is of acceptable quality. Any
Win32 stability or security problems do not impact, in any way,
Apache on other platforms.  With the continued donation of time
and resources by individuals and companies, we hope that the Win32
version of Apache will grow stronger through the 1.3.x release cycle.


Thank you for using Apache.

See you at ApacheCon 2000 in Orlanda, Florida, March 8-10, 2000.

Of special note are the many changes to the Apache configuration process.
The default path layout generated by the "configure" script has been
changed to be more consistent with the traditional Apache layout, and
several new command-line options have been added to make compilation
easier.  Please see the README.configure and INSTALL files for complete
information.  In addition, we have moved all of the server configuration
directives to a single file (httpd.conf-dist), updated mime.types, and
improved the examples for first-time installers.  Finally, a few of the
rarely-used command-line options for httpd have been changed to be more
consistent with the help options of other programs.

d7 38
a44 119
   The Apache Software Foundation and The Apache Server Project are
   pleased to announce the release of version 1.3.26 of the Apache HTTP
   Server.  This Announcement notes the significant changes in 1.3.26.
   Apache 1.3.25 was not released.

   This version of Apache is principally a security and bug fix
   release.  A summary of the bug fixes is given at the end of this document.
   Of particular note is that 1.3.26 addresses and fixes the issues noted
   in CAN-2002-0392 (mitre.org) [CERT VU#944335] regarding a vulnerability
   in the handling of chunked transfer encoding.  We would like to thank
   Mark Litchfield of ngssoftware.com for discovering and reporting the
   vulnerability.

   We consider Apache 1.3.26 to be the best version of Apache available
   and we strongly recommend that users of older versions, especially of
   the 1.1.x and 1.2.x family, upgrade as soon as possible.  No further
   releases will be made in the 1.2.x family.

   Apache 1.3.26 is available for download from
   
       http://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/

   Please see the CHANGES_1.3 file in the same directory for a full list
   of changes.

   Binary distributions are available from

       http://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/binaries/

   The source and binary distributions are also available via any of the
   mirrors listed at

       http://www.apache.org/mirrors/

   As of Apache 1.3.17, Win32 binary distributions are now based on the
   Microsoft Installer (.MSI) technology.  This change occurred in order to
   resolve the many problems WinME and Win2K users experienced with the
   older InstallShield-based installer.exe file.  While development
   continues to make this new installation method more robust, questions
   should be directed at the news:comp.infosystems.www.servers.ms-windows
   newsgroup.

   As of Apache 1.3.12 binary distributions contain all standard Apache
   modules as shared objects (if supported by the platform) and include
   full source code.  Installation is easily done by executing the
   included install script.  See the README.bindist and INSTALL.bindist
   files for a complete explanation.  Please note that the binary
   distributions are only provided for your convenience and current
   distributions for specific platforms are not always available.

   For an overview of new features introduced after 1.2 please see
   
   http://httpd.apache.org/docs/new_features_1_3.html

   In general, Apache 1.3 offers several substantial improvements over
   version 1.2, including better performance, reliability and a wider
   range of supported platforms, including Windows NT and 2000 (which
   fall under the "Win32" label), OS2, Netware, and TPE threaded
   platforms.

   Apache is the most popular web server in the known universe; over half
   of the servers on the Internet are running Apache or one of its
   variants.

   IMPORTANT NOTE FOR WIN32 USERS: Over the years, many users have come
   to trust Apache as a secure and stable server.  It must be realized
   that the current Win32 code has not yet reached the levels of the Unix
   version, but is of acceptable quality.  Win32 stability or security
   problems do not reflect on the Unix version.

                     Apache 1.3.26 Major changes

  Security vulnerabilities

     * Fix the security vulnerability noted in CAN-2002-0392 (mitre.org)
       regarding the handling of chunked transfer encoding.

  New features

   The main new features in 1.3.26 (compared to 1.3.24) are:

     * Add some popular types to the mime types magic file.

   New features that relate to specific platforms:

     * Unix: Added a '-F' flag which causes the supervisor process to
       no longer fork down and detach and instead stay attached to
       the tty - thus making live for automatic restart and exit checking
       code easier.

  Bugs fixed

   The following bugs were found in Apache 1.3.24 (or earlier) and have
   been fixed in Apache 1.3.26:

     * Allow child processes sufficient time for cleanups but making
       ap_select in reclaim_child_processes more "resistant" to
       signal interupts.

     * Fix for a problem in mod_rewrite which would lead to 400 Bad Request
       responses for rewriting rules which resulted in a local path.
       Note: This will also reject invalid requests as issued by
       Netscape-4.x Roaming Profiles (on a DAV-enabled server)

     * Recognize platform-specific root directories (other than
       leading slash) in mod_rewrite for filename rewrite rules.

     * Disallow anything but whitespace on the request line after the
       HTTP/x.y protocol string to prevent arbitrary user input from
       ending up in the access_log and error_log.  Also control characters
       are now escaped.

     * A large number of fixes in mod_proxy including: adding support
       for dechunking chunked responses, correcting a timeout problem
       which would force long or slow POST requests to close after 300
       seconds, adding "X-Forwarded" headers, dealing correctly with the
       multiple-cookie header bug, ability to handle unexpected
       100-continue responses sent during PUT or POST commands, and a
       change to tighten up the Server header overwrite bugfix.

   pleased to announce the release of version 1.3.27 of the Apache HTTP
   Server.  This Announcement notes the significant changes in 1.3.27
   as compared to 1.3.26.

   This version of Apache is principally a security and bug fix release.
   A summary of the bug fixes is given at the end of this document.
   Of particular note is that 1.3.27 addresses and fixes 3 security
   vulnerabilities.

   CAN-2002-0839 (cve.mitre.org): A vulnerability exists in all versions of
   Apache prior to 1.3.27 on platforms using System V shared memory based
   scoreboards.  This vulnerability allows an attacker who can execute under
   the Apache UID to exploit the Apache shared memory scoreboard format and
   send a signal to any process as root or cause a local denial of service
   attack.  We thank iDefense for their responsible notification and 
   disclosure of this issue.

   CAN-2002-0840 (cve.mitre.org): Apache is susceptible to a cross site
   scripting vulnerability in the default 404 page of any web server hosted
   on a domain that allows wildcard DNS lookups.  We thank Matthew Murphy for
   the responsible notification and disclosure of this issue.
   
   CAN-2002-0843 (cve.mitre.org): There were some possible overflows in ab.c
   which could be exploited by a malicious server. Note that this
   vulnerability is not in Apache itself, but rather one of the support
   programs bundled with Apache. We thank David Wagner for the responsible
   notification and disclosure of this issue.

   IMPORTANT NOTE FOR APACHE USERS:   Apache 1.3 was designed for Unix OS
   variants.  While  the ports to non-Unix platforms (such as Win32, Netware
   or OS2) are of an acceptable quality, Apache 1.3 is not optimized for
   these platforms.  Security, stability, or performance issues on these
   non-Unix ports do not generally apply to the Unix version, due to
   software's Unix origin.

   Apache 2.0 has been structured for multiple operating systems from its 
   inception, by introducing the Apache Portability Library and MPM modules.
   Users on non-Unix platforms are strongly encouraged to move up to 
   Apache 2.0 for better performance, stability and security on their
   platforms.

     * Fix the security vulnerability noted in CAN-2002-0839 (cve.mitre.org)
       regarding ownership permissions of System V shared memory based
       scoreboards.  The fix resulted in the new ShmemUIDisUser directive.

     * Fix the security vulnerability noted in CAN-2002-0840 (cvs.mitre.org)
       regarding a cross-site scripting vulnerability in the default error
       page when using wildcard DNS.

     * Fix the security vulnerability noted in CAN-2002-0843 (cve.mitre.org)
       regarding some possible overflows in ab.c which could be exploited by
       a malicious server.

   The main new features in 1.3.27 (compared to 1.3.26) are:

     * The new ErrorHeader directive has been added.

     * Configuration file globbing can now use simple pattern
       matching.
d85 1
a85 17
     * The protocol version (eg: HTTP/1.1) in the request line parsing
       is now case insensitive.

     * ap_snprintf() can now distinguish between an output which was
       truncated, and an output which exactly filled the buffer.

     * Add ProtocolReqCheck directive, which determines if Apache will
       check for a valid protocol string in the request (eg: HTTP/1.1)
       and return HTTP_BAD_REQUEST if not valid. Versions of Apache
       prior to 1.3.26 would silently ignore bad protocol strings, but
       1.3.26 included a more strict check. This makes it runtime
       configurable.

     * Added support for Berkeley-DB/4.x to mod_auth_db.

     * httpd -V will now also print out the compile time defined
       HARD_SERVER_LIMIT value.
d89 4
a92 6
     * Support Caldera OpenUNIX 8.
     
     * Use SysV semaphores by default on OpenBSD.

     * Implemented file locking in mod_rewrite for the NetWare
       CLib platform.
d96 2
a97 2
   The following bugs were found in Apache 1.3.26 (or earlier) and have
   been fixed in Apache 1.3.27:
d99 24
a122 15
     * mod_proxy fixes:
        - The cache in mod_proxy was incorrectly updating the Content-Length
          value from 304 responses when doing validation.
        - Fix a problem in proxy where headers from other modules were
          added to the response headers when this was already done in the
          core already.

     * In 1.3.26, a null or all blank Content-Length field would be
       triggered as an error; previous versions would silently ignore
       this and assume 0.  1.3.27 restores this previous behavior.

     * Win32: Fix one byte buffer overflow in ap_get_win32_interpreter
       when a CGI script's #! line does not contain a \r or \n (i.e.
       a line feed character) in the first 1023 bytes. The overflow
       is always a '\0' (string termination) character.

a131 1
   The main new features in 1.3.28 (compared to 1.3.27) are:
d133 2
a134 8
     * Added new ap_register_cleanup_ex() API function which allows
       for a "magic" cleanup function to be run at register time
       rather than at cleanup time. 

     * Improvements to mod_usertrack that allows for a regular (verbose)
       as well as "compact" version of the tracking cookie (the new
       'CookieFormat' directive), and the ability to prepend a string
       to the cookie via the 'CookiePrefix' directive.
d138 3
a140 3
     * Introduce Win32 .pdb diagnostic symbols into the Apache 1.3 build
       (as created in Apache 2.0.45 and later.)  which akes debugging and
       analysis of crash dumps and Dr. Watson logs trivial.
d142 2
a143 2
     * AIX: Change the default accept mechanism from pthread back to
       fcntl.
d147 2
a148 5
   The following noteworthy bugs were found in Apache 1.3.27 (or earlier)
   and have been fixed in Apache 1.3.28:

     * Make sure the accept mutex is released before calling child exit
       hooks and cleanups.
d150 15
a164 14
     * Fix mod_rewrite's handling of absolute URIs.  The escaping routines
       now work scheme dependent and the query string will only be
       appended if supported by the particular scheme.

     * Prevent obscenely large values of precision in ap_vformatter
       from clobbering a buffer.

     * Update timeout algorithm in free_proc_chain. If a subprocess
       did not exit immediately, the thread would sleep for 3 seconds
       before checking the subprocess exit status again. In a very
       common case when the subprocess was an HTTP server CGI script,
       the CGI script actually exited a fraction of a second into the 3
       second sleep, which effectively limited the server to serving one 
       CGI request every 3 seconds across a persistent connection.
