@from tamas tevesz:

==> some more alien platforms and obsolete info. the mod/core.html
change is because 1) the target link doesn't exist, 2) it
probably was meant to refer to misc/known_bugs.html in the
first place, which just got removed.
thanks henning for guidance.

    While Apache is for the most part a drop-in replacement for
    NCSA's httpd, there are a couple gotcha's to watch out for.
    These are mostly due to the fact that the parser for config and
    access control files was rewritten from scratch, so certain
    liberties the earlier servers took may not be available here.
    These are all easily fixable. If you know of other problems

  <P>

  <LI><CODE>AuthUserFile</CODE> requires a full pathname. In earlier
      versions of NCSA httpd and Apache, you could use a filename
      relative to the .htaccess file. This could be a major security hole,
      as it made it trivially easy to make a ".htpass" file in the a
      directory easily accessible by the world. We recommend you store
      your passwords outside your document tree.

  <P>We might add <CODE>virtual</CODE> support to <CODE>exec cmd</CODE> to
  make up for this difference.

  <P>

  <LI>&lt;Limit&gt; silliness - in the old Apache 0.6.5, a
   directive of &lt;Limit GET&gt; would also restrict POST methods - Apache 0.8.8's new
   core is correct in not presuming a limit on a GET is the same limit on a POST,
   so if you are relying on that behavior you need to change your access configurations
   to reflect that.

  <P>

  <LI>Icons for FancyIndexing broken - well, no, they're not broken,
  we've just upgraded the
  icons from flat .xbm files to pretty and much smaller .gif files, courtesy of

  directives.

  <P>

  <LI>Under IRIX, the "Group" directive in httpd.conf needs to be a
  valid group name
  (<EM>i.e.</EM>, "nogroup") not the numeric group ID.  The distribution
  httpd.conf, and earlier  ones, had the default Group be "#-1", which
  was causing silent exits at startup.<p>

<li><code>.asis</code> files: Apache 0.6.5 did not require a Status header;
it added one automatically if the .asis file contained a Location header.
0.8.14 requires a Status header. <p>

  <P>
  <LI>Apache versions before 1.2b1 will ignore the last line of configuration
  files if the last line does not have a trailing newline. This affects

    <h1 align="CENTER">Compatibility Notes with NCSA's Server</h1>
    <hr />
    While Apache is for the most part a drop-in replacement for
    NCSA's httpd, there are a couple gotcha's to watch out for.
    These are mostly due to the fact that the parser for config and
    access control files was rewritten from scratch, so certain
    liberties the earlier servers took may not be available here.
    These are all easily fixable. If you know of other problems
    that belong here, <a
    href="http://httpd.apache.org/bug_report.html">let us know.</a>
    

    <p>Please also check the <a
    href="known_client_problems.html">known client problems</a>
    page.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>As of Apache 1.3.1, methods named in a <a
      href="../mod/core.html#limit"><samp>&lt;Limit&gt;</samp></a>
      section <em>must</em> be listed in upper-case. Lower- or
      mixed-case method names will result in a configuration
      error.</li>

      <li>The basic mod_auth <code>AuthGroupFile</code>-specified
      group file format allows commas between user names - Apache
      does not.</li>

      <li>If you follow the NCSA guidelines for setting up access
      restrictions based on client domain, you may well have added
      entries for <code>AuthType, AuthName, AuthUserFile</code> or
      <code>AuthGroupFile</code>. <strong>None</strong> of these
      are needed (or appropriate) for restricting access based on
      client domain. When Apache sees <code>AuthType</code> it
      (reasonably) assumes you are using some authorization type
      based on username and password. Please remove
      <code>AuthType</code>, it's unnecessary even for NCSA.</li>

      <li><code>OldScriptAlias</code> is no longer supported.</li>

      <li><code>exec cgi=""</code> produces reasonable
      <strong>malformed header</strong> responses when used to
      invoke non-CGI scripts.<br />
       The NCSA code ignores the missing header (bad idea).<br />
       Solution: write CGI to the CGI spec and use
      <code>include&nbsp;virtual</code>, or use <code>exec
      cmd=""</code> instead.</li>

      <li>Icons for FancyIndexing broken - well, no, they're not
      broken, we've just upgraded the icons from flat .xbm files to
      pretty and much smaller .gif files, courtesy of <a
      href="mailto:kevinh@@eit.com">Kevin Hughes</a> at <a
      href="http://www.eit.com/">EIT</a>. If you are using the same
      srm.conf from an old distribution, make sure you add the new
      <a href="../mod/mod_autoindex.html#addicon">AddIcon</a>, <a
      href="../mod/mod_autoindex.html#addiconbytype">AddIconByType</a>,
      and <a
      href="../mod/mod_autoindex.html#defaulticon">DefaultIcon</a>
      directives.</li>

      <li>Apache versions before 1.2b1 will ignore the last line of
      configuration files if the last line does not have a trailing
      newline. This affects configuration files (httpd.conf,
      access.conf and srm.conf), and htpasswd and htgroup
      files.</li>

      <li>Apache does not permit commas delimiting the methods in
      &lt;Limit&gt;.</li>

      <li>Apache's <code>&lt;VirtualHost&gt;</code> treats all
      addresses as "optional" (<em>i.e.</em>, the server should
      continue booting if it can't resolve the address). Whereas in
      NCSA the default is to fail booting unless an added
      <code>optional</code> keyword is included.</li>

      <li>Apache does not implement <code>OnDeny</code>; use <a
      href="../mod/core.html#errordocument"><code>ErrorDocument</code></a>
      instead.</li>

      <li>Apache (as of 1.3) always performs the equivalent of
      <code>HostnameLookups minimal</code>. <code>minimal</code> is
      not an option to <a
      href="../mod/core.html#hostnamelookups"><code>HostnameLookups</code></a>.</li>

      <li>To embed spaces in directive arguments NCSA used a
      backslash before the space. Apache treats backslashes as
      normal characters. To embed spaces surround the argument with
      double-quotes instead.</li>

      <li>Apache does not implement the NCSA <code>referer</code>
      directive. See <a
      href="http://bugs.apache.org/index/full/968">PR#968</a> for a
      few brief suggestions on alternative ways to implement the
      same thing under Apache.</li>

      <li>Apache does not allow ServerRoot settings inside a
      VirtualHost container. There is only one global ServerRoot in
      Apache; any desired changes in paths for virtual hosts need
      to be made with the explicit directives, <em>e.g.</em>,
      DocumentRoot, TransferLog, <em>etc.</em></li>

      <li>The <code>AddType</code> directive cannot be used to set
      the type of particular files. Instead, you can scope you
      directives using &lt;Files&gt; blocks.</li>
    </ol>
    More to come when we notice them....
