@this commit is really florian@@'s, since he's the one who made removal
of our forked apache possible by his work on nginx and slowcgi, but he
doesn't want it - so it is my pleasure to tedu it. I spent so much work
on chroot in it 10 years ago - and am very happy to see it go now, nginx
is a far better choice today.
Bye bye, Apache, won't miss you.

    <h1 align="CENTER">Module mod_mime_magic</h1>

    <p>This module provides for determining the MIME type of a file
    by looking at a few bytes of its contents.</p>

    rel="Help"><strong>Module Identifier:</strong></a>
    mime_magic_module</p>

    <h2>Summary</h2>

    <p>This module determines the MIME type of files in the same
    way the Unix file(1) command works: it looks at the first few
    bytes of the file. It is intended as a "second line of defense"
    for cases that <a href="mod_mime.html">mod_mime</a> can't
    resolve. To assure that mod_mime gets first try at determining
    a file's MIME type, be sure to list mod_mime_magic
    <strong>before</strong> mod_mime in the configuration.</p>

    <p>This module is derived from a free version of the
    <code>file(1)</code> command for Unix, which uses "magic
    numbers" and other hints from a file's contents to figure out
    what the contents are. This module is active only if the magic
    file is specified by the <a
    href="#mimemagicfile"><code>MimeMagicFile</code></a>
    directive.</p>

    <h2>Directives</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="#mimemagicfile">MimeMagicFile</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Format of the Magic File</h2>

    <p>The contents of the file are plain ASCII text in 4-5
    columns. Blank lines are allowed but ignored. Commented lines
    use a hash mark "#". The remaining lines are parsed for the
    following columns:</p>

    <table border="1">
      <tr valign="top">
        <th>Column</th>

        <th>Description</th>
      </tr>

      <tr valign="top">
        <td>1</td>

        <td>byte number to begin checking from<br />
         "&gt;" indicates a dependency upon the previous non-"&gt;"
        line</td>
      </tr>

      <tr valign="top">
        <td>2</td>

        <td>
          type of data to match

              <td>single character</td>

            <tr>
              <td>short</td>

              <td>machine-order 16-bit integer</td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
              <td>long</td>

              epoch/1970)</td>

      <tr valign="top">
        <td>5</td>

        <td>MIME encoding if matched (optional)</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>For example, the following magic file lines would recognize
    some audio formats.</p>
<pre>
# Sun/NeXT audio data
0       string          .snd
&gt;12     belong          1               audio/basic
&gt;12     belong          2               audio/basic
&gt;12     belong          3               audio/basic
&gt;12     belong          4               audio/basic
&gt;12     belong          5               audio/basic
&gt;12     belong          6               audio/basic
&gt;12     belong          7               audio/basic
&gt;12     belong          23              audio/x-adpcm
</pre>
    Or these would recognize the difference between "*.doc" files
    containing Microsoft Word or FrameMaker documents. (These are
    incompatible file formats which use the same file suffix.) 
<pre>
# Frame
0       string          \&lt;MakerFile     application/x-frame
0       string          \&lt;MIFFile       application/x-frame
0       string          \&lt;MakerDictionary       application/x-frame
0       string          \&lt;MakerScreenFon        application/x-frame
0       string          \&lt;MML           application/x-frame
0       string          \&lt;Book          application/x-frame
0       string          \&lt;Maker         application/x-frame

# MS-Word
0       string          \376\067\0\043                  application/msword
0       string          \320\317\021\340\241\261        application/msword
0       string          \333\245-\0\0\0                 application/msword
</pre>
    An optional MIME encoding can be included as a fifth column.
    For example, this can recognize gzipped files and set the
    encoding for them. 
<pre>
# gzip (GNU zip, not to be confused with [Info-ZIP/PKWARE] zip archiver)
0       string          \037\213        application/octet-stream        x-gzip
</pre>

    <h2>Performance Issues</h2>
    This module is not for every system. If your system is barely
    keeping up with its load or if you're performing a web server
    benchmark, you may not want to enable this because the
    processing is not free. 

    <p>However, an effort was made to improve the performance of
    the original file(1) code to make it fit in a busy web server.
    It was designed for a server where there are thousands of users
    who publish their own documents. This is probably very common
    on intranets. Many times, it's helpful if the server can make
    more intelligent decisions about a file's contents than the
    file name allows ...even if just to reduce the "why doesn't my
    page work" calls when users improperly name their own files.
    You have to decide if the extra work suits your
    environment.</p>

    <p>When compiling an Apache server, this module should be at or
    near the top of the list of modules in the Configuration file.
    The modules are listed in increasing priority so that will mean
    this one is used only as a last resort, just like it was
    designed to.</p>

  <H2>Performance Issues</H2>

  This module is not for every system.  If your system is barely keeping
  up with its load or if you're performing a web server benchmark,
  you may not want to enable this because the processing is not free.
  <P>
  However, an effort was made to improve the performance of the original
  file(1) code to make it fit in a busy web server.
  It was designed for a server where there are thousands of users who
  publish their own documents.
  This is probably very common on intranets.
  Many times, it's helpful
  if the server can make more intelligent decisions about a file's
  contents than the file name allows
  ...even if just to reduce the "why doesn't my page work" calls
  when users improperly name their own files.
  You have to decide if the extra work suits your environment.
  <P>
  When compiling an Apache server, this module should be at or near the
  top of the list of modules in the Configuration file.  The modules are
  listed in increasing priority so that will mean this one is used only
  as a last resort, just like it was designed to.

  This module is contained in the mod_mime_magic.c file, and is
  an optional extension to the Apache HTTPD server.
  It can be used to determine the MIME type of a file by looking at a
  few bytes of its contents, the same way the Unix file(1) command works.
  To use mod_mime_magic you have to enable the following line in the
  server build <TT>Configuration</TT> file: 

  <PRE>
      AddModule modules/standard/mod_mime_magic.o
  </PRE>

  This should be listed <EM>before</EM> mod_mime in the build
  <TT>Configuration</TT> file so that it will be used after mod_mime.
  mod_mime_magic is intended as a "second line of defense" for cases
  mod_mime cannot resolve.

  This module is derived from a free version of the <CODE>file(1)</CODE>
  command for Unix,
  which uses "magic numbers" and other hints from a file's contents to
  figure out what the contents are.
  In the case of this module,
  it tries to figure out the MIME type of the file.
  <P>
  This module active only if the magic file is specified by the 
  <A HREF="#mimemagicfile"><CODE>MimeMagicFile</CODE></A> directive.

    <p>This module provides for determining the MIME type of a file
    by looking at a few bytes of its contents.</p>

    <h2>Summary</h2>

    <p>This module determines the MIME type of files in the same
    way the Unix file(1) command works: it looks at the first few
    bytes of the file. It is intended as a "second line of defense"
    for cases that <a href="mod_mime.html">mod_mime</a> can't
    resolve. To assure that mod_mime gets first try at determining
    a file's MIME type, be sure to list mod_mime_magic
    <strong>before</strong> mod_mime in the configuration.</p>

    <p>This module is derived from a free version of the
    <code>file(1)</code> command for Unix, which uses "magic
    numbers" and other hints from a file's contents to figure out
    what the contents are. This module is active only if the magic
    file is specified by the <a
    href="#mimemagicfile"><code>MimeMagicFile</code></a>
    directive.</p>

    <h2>Directives</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="#mimemagicfile">MimeMagicFile</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Format of the Magic File</h2>

    <p>The contents of the file are plain ASCII text in 4-5
    columns. Blank lines are allowed but ignored. Commented lines
    use a hash mark "#". The remaining lines are parsed for the
    following columns:</p>

    <table border="1">
      <tr valign="top">
        <th>Column</th>

        <th>Description</th>
      </tr>

      <tr valign="top">
        <td>5</td>

        <td>MIME encoding if matched (optional)</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>For example, the following magic file lines would recognize
    some audio formats.</p>
<pre>
d107 7
a113 5
</pre>
    Or these would recognize the difference between "*.doc" files
    containing Microsoft Word or FrameMaker documents. (These are
    incompatible file formats which use the same file suffix.) 
<pre>
d127 7
a133 5
</pre>
    An optional MIME encoding can be included as a fifth column.
    For example, this can recognize gzipped files and set the
    encoding for them.
