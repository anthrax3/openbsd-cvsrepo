# the index (URL prefix, not filesystem prefix), and QUERY_STRING is the
# word to be found.
#

# You may need to tweak the following line to point to the correct
# location of the index file on your system (it's in the
# apache/htdocs/manual directory of the Apache distribution tree).

  This script performs a very simple search across the Apache
  documentation for any single case-insensitive word.  No combinations,
  wildcards, regular expressions, word-stubbing, or other fancy options
  are supported; this is just to help you find topics quickly.  Only
  those pages which include the <EM>exact</EM> word you type will be
  listed.

  Documents containing the search word are <EM>not</EM> listed in any
