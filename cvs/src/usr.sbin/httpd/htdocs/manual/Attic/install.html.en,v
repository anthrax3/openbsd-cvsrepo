    <h2><a id="download" name="download">Downloading Apache</a></h2>

    <p>You may download the latest version of Apache either directly from the
    <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/download.cgi">Download Page</a>.</p>

    <h2><a id="intro" name="intro">Introduction</a></h2>

    <p>Like all good things, there are two ways to configure, compile, and
    install Apache. You can go for the 3-minute installation process using
    the APACI process described below; or, you can opt for the same mechanism
    used in previous versions of Apache, as described in the file
    'src/INSTALL'. Each mechanism has its benefits and drawbacks - APACI is
    newer and a little more raw, but it gets you up and running the least
    amount of time, whereas the "Configuration.tmpl" mechanism may be more
    familiar and give you some more flexibility to the power user. We'd be
    very interested in your comments and feedback regarding each
    approach.</p>

    <h2><a id="apaci" name="apaci">Installing the Apache 1.3 HTTP server with
    APACI</a></h2>

    <h3>Overview for the impatient</h3>
<pre>
     $ ./configure --prefix=PREFIX
     $ make
     $ make install
     $ PREFIX/bin/apachectl start
</pre>

    <p><b>NOTE:</b> <code>PREFIX</code> is not the string "PREFIX". Instead
    use the Unix filesystem path under which Apache should be installed. For
    instance use "<code>/usr/local/apache</code>" for PREFIX above.</p>

    <h3><a id="requirements" name="requirements">Requirements</a></h3>

    <p>The following requirements exist for building Apache:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt><b>Disk Space:</b></dt>

      <dd>Make sure you have approximately 12 MB of temporary free disk space
      available. After installation Apache occupies approximately 3 MB of
      disk space (the actual required disk space depends on the amount of
      compiled in third party modules, etc).</dd>

      <dt><b>ANSI-C Compiler:</b></dt>

      <dd>Make sure you have an ANSI-C compiler installed. The GNU C compiler
      (GCC) from the Free Software Foundation (FSF) is recommended (version
      2.7.2 is fine). If you don't have GCC then at least make sure your
      vendors compiler is ANSI compliant. You can find the homepage of GNU at
      http://www.gnu.org/ and the GCC distribution under
      http://www.gnu.org/order/ftp.html .</dd>

      <dt><b>Perl 5 Interpreter [OPTIONAL]:</b></dt>

      <dd>For some of the support scripts like `apxs' or `dbmmanage' (which
      are written in Perl) the Perl 5 interpreter is required (versions 5.003
      and 5.004 are fine). If no such interpreter is found by APACI's
      `configure' script this is no harm. Of course, you still can build and
      install Apache 1.3. Only those support scripts cannot be used. If you
      have multiple Perl interpreters installed (perhaps a Perl 4 from the
      vendor and a Perl 5 from your own), then it is recommended to use the
      --with-perl option (see below) to make sure the correct one is selected
      by APACI.</dd>

      <dt><b>Dynamic Shared Object (DSO) support [OPTIONAL]:</b></dt>

      <dd>
        <p>To provide maximum flexibility Apache now is able to load modules
        under runtime via the DSO mechanism by using the pragmatic
        dlopen()/dlsym() system calls. These system calls are not available
        under all operating systems therefore you cannot use the DSO
        mechanism on all platforms. And Apache currently has only limited
        built-in knowledge on how to compile shared objects because this is
        heavily platform-dependent. The current state is this:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Out-of-the-box supported platforms are: 

            <p>
            <table border="0">
              <tr>
                <td>Linux</td>
                <td>SunOS</td>
                <td>UnixWare</td>
                <td>Darwin/Mac OS</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>FreeBSD</td>
                <td>Solaris</td>
                <td>AIX</td>
                <td>OpenStep/Mach</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>OpenBSD</td>
                <td>IRIX</td>
                <td>SCO</td>
                <td>DYNIX/ptx</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>NetBSD</td>
                <td>HPUX</td>
                <td>ReliantUNIX</td>
                <td>BSDI</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Digital Unix</td>
                <td>DGUX</td>
              </tr>
            </table>
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            Entirely unsupported platforms are: 

            <p>Ultrix</p>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>If your system is not on these lists but has the dlopen-style
        interface, you either have to provide the appropriate compiler and
        linker flags (see CFLAGS_SHLIB, LDFLAGS_SHLIB and
        LDFLAGS_SHLIB_EXPORT below) manually or at least make sure a Perl 5
        interpreter is installed from which Apache can guess the options.</p>

        <p>For more in-depth information about DSO support in Apache 1.3
        please read the document htdocs/manual/dso.html carefully. Especially
        the section entitled "Advantages &amp; Disadvantages" because using
        the DSO mechanism can have strange side-effects if you are not
        careful. BE WARNED!</p>
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <h3><a name="configure">Configuring the source tree</a></h3>

    <p>The next step is to configure the Apache source tree for your
    particular platform and personal requirements. The most important setup
    here is the location prefix where Apache is to be installed later,
    because Apache has to be configured for this location to work correctly.
    But there are a lot of other options available for your pleasure.</p>

    <p>For a short impression of what possibilities you have, here is a
    typical example which compiles Apache for the installation tree
    /sw/pkg/apache with a particular compiler and flags plus the two
    additional modules mod_rewrite and mod_proxy for later loading through
    the DSO mechanism:</p>
<pre>
     $ CC="pgcc" OPTIM="-O2" \
       ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/apache \
                   --enable-module=rewrite --enable-shared=rewrite \
                   --enable-module=proxy   --enable-shared=proxy
</pre>

    <p>For a complete list of the available options, type the following
    command:</p>
  <p><code>./configure --help</code></p>

 <p>See also the file <code>README.configure</code> for listings of
 example configurations.</p>

    <h3><a name="build">Building the package</a></h3>

    <p>Now you can build the various parts which form the Apache package by
    simply running the command</p>
<pre>
        $ make 
</pre>

    <p>Please be patient here, this takes approximately 2 minutes to complete
    under a Pentium-166/FreeBSD-2.2 system, dependent on the amount of
    modules you have enabled.</p>

    <h3><a name="installing">Installing the package</a></h3>

    <p>Now its time to install the package under the configured installation
    <code>PREFIX</code> (see the <code>--prefix</code> option above):</p>
<pre>
        $ make install
</pre>

   <p>In the following examples, <code>PREFIX</code> is not the literal string
       "PREFIX", but whatever argument you provided to
       the<code>--prefix</code> option.</p>

<!-- Building and installing Apache in the traditional way -->

    <h2><a name="traditional">Building and installing Apache in the traditional way</a></h2>

    Before the advent of APACI, there was just one way to build and
    install Apache. While APACI gave a configuration interface which is
    more familiar to some people, the older method gives a way to
    configure the installation without typing a large number of
    command-line options.

    <h3><a name="trad_configure">Configuring the installation</a></h3>

    Compiling Apache consists of three steps: First select which
    Apache <strong>modules</strong> you want to include into the
    server. Second create a configuration for your operating
    system. Third compile the executable. 

    <p>All configuration of Apache is performed in the
    <code>src</code> directory of the Apache distribution. Change
    into this directory.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Select modules to compile into Apache in the <code>Configuration</code>
        file <code>src/Configuration.tmpl</code>. Uncomment lines
        corresponding to those optional modules you wish to include
        (among the AddModule lines at the bottom of the file), or
        add new lines corresponding to additional modules you have
        downloaded or written. (See <a
        href="misc/API.html">API.html</a> for preliminary docs on
        how to write Apache modules). Advanced users can comment
        out some of the default modules if they are sure they will
        not need them (be careful though, since many of the default
        modules are vital for the correct operation and security of
        the server). 

        <p>You should also read the instructions in the
        <code>Configuration</code> file to see if you need to set
        any of the <code>Rule</code> lines.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        Configure Apache for your operating system. Normally you
        can just run the <code>Configure</code> script as given
        below. However if this fails or you have any special
        requirements (<em>e.g.</em>, to include an additional
        library required by an optional module) you might need to
        edit one or more of the following options in the
        <code>Configuration</code> file: <code>EXTRA_CFLAGS, LIBS,
        LDFLAGS, INCLUDES</code>. 

        <p>Run the <code>Configure</code> script:</p>

        <blockquote>
<pre>
    % Configure
    Using 'Configuration' as config file
     + configured for &lt;whatever&gt; platform
     + setting C compiler to &lt;whatever&gt; *
     + setting C compiler optimization-level to &lt;whatever&gt; *
     + Adding selected modules
     + doing sanity check on compiler and options
    Creating Makefile in support
    Creating Makefile in main
    Creating Makefile in os/unix
    Creating Makefile in modules/standard
  
</pre>
        </blockquote>
        (*: Depending on Configuration and your system, Configure
        might not print these lines. That's OK). 

        <p>This generates a Makefile for use in stage 3. It also
        creates a Makefile in the support directory, for
        compilation of the optional support programs.</p>

        <p>(If you want to maintain multiple configurations, you
        can give an option to <code>Configure</code> to tell it to
        read an alternative Configuration file, such as
        <code>Configure -file Configuration.ai</code>).</p>
      </li>

<h3><a name="trad_compile">Compiling Apache</a></h3>

      <li>Type <code>make</code>.</li>
    </ol>
    The modules we place in the Apache distribution are the ones we
    have tested and are used regularly by various members of the
    Apache development group. Additional modules contributed by
    members or third parties with specific needs or functions are
    available at &lt;<a
    href="http://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/contrib/modules/">http://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/contrib/modules/</a>&gt;.
    There are instructions on that page for linking these modules
    into the core Apache code. 

    <h3><a name="trad_install">Installing Apache</a></h3>
    You will have a binary file called <code>httpd</code> in the
    <code>src</code> directory. A binary distribution of Apache
    will supply this file. 

    <p>The next step is to install the program and configure it.
    Apache is designed to be configured and run from the same set
    of directories where it is compiled. If you want to run it from
    somewhere else, make a directory and copy the
    <code>conf</code>, <code>logs</code> and <code>icons</code>
    directories into it. In either case you should read the <a
    href="misc/security_tips.html#serverroot">security tips</a>
    describing how to set the permissions on the server root
    directory.</p>

    <p>The next step is to edit the configuration files for the
    server. This consists of setting up various
    <strong>directives</strong> in up to three central
    configuration files. By default, these files are located in the
    <code>conf</code> directory and are called
    <code>srm.conf</code>, <code>access.conf</code> and
    <code>httpd.conf</code>. To help you get started there are same
    files in the <code>conf</code> directory of the distribution,
    called <code>srm.conf-dist</code>,
    <code>access.conf-dist</code> and <code>httpd.conf-dist</code>.
    Copy or rename these files to the names without the
    <code>-dist</code>. Then edit each of the files. Read the
    comments in each file carefully. Failure to setup these files
    correctly could lead to your server not working or being
    insecure. You should also have an additional file in the
    <code>conf</code> directory called <code>mime.types</code>.
    This file usually does not need editing.</p>

    <p>First edit <code>httpd.conf</code>. This sets up general
    attributes about the server: the port number, the user it runs
    as, <em>etc.</em> Next edit the <code>srm.conf</code> file;
    this sets up the root of the document tree, special functions
    like server-parsed HTML or internal imagemap parsing,
    <em>etc.</em> Finally, edit the <code>access.conf</code> file
    to at least set the base cases of access.</p>

    <p>In addition to these three files, the server behavior can be
    configured on a directory-by-directory basis by using
    <code>.htaccess</code> files in directories accessed by the
    server.</p>

    <h3>Compiling Support Programs</h3>
    In addition to the main <code>httpd</code> server which is
    compiled and configured as above, Apache includes a number of
    support programs. These are not compiled by default. The
    support programs are in the <code>support</code> directory of
    the distribution. To compile the support programs, change into
    this directory and type 
<pre>
    make
</pre>

    <h2><a name="testing">Testing the package</a></h2>

    <p>Now you can fire up your Apache HTTP server by immediately running</p>
<pre>
        $ PREFIX/bin/apachectl start
</pre>

    <p>and then you should be able to request your first document via URL
    http://localhost/ (when you built and installed Apache as root or at
    least used the --without-confadjust option) or http://localhost:8080/
    (when you built and installed Apache as a regular user). Then stop the
    server again by running:</p>
<pre>
        $ PREFIX/bin/apachectl stop
</pre>

    <h2><a name="time">Set your system time properly!</a></h2>
    Proper operation of a public web server requires accurate time
    keeping, since elements of the HTTP protocol are expressed as
    the time of day. So, it's time to investigate setting up NTP or
    some other time synchronization system on your Unix box, or
    the <code>net time</code> command on NT.

<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Compiling and Installing Apache 1.3</H1>

<P>This document covers compilation and installation of Apache on Unix
systems, using the manual build and install method. If you wish to
use the autoconf-style configure interface, you should instead
read the INSTALL file in the root directory of the Apache source
distribution. For compiling and installation on specific platforms, see</P>

<H2>Downloading Apache</H2>

Information on the latest version of Apache can be found on the Apache
web server at <A
HREF="http://www.apache.org/">http://www.apache.org/</A>.  This will
list the current release, any more recent beta-test release, together
with details of mirror web and anonymous ftp sites.

<P>

If you downloaded a binary distribution, skip to <A
HREF="#install">Installing Apache</A>. Otherwise read the next section
for how to compile the server.

<H2>Compiling Apache</H2>

Compiling Apache consists of three steps: Firstly select which Apache
<STRONG>modules</STRONG> you want to include into the server. Secondly create a
configuration for your operating system. Thirdly compile the
executable.
<P>

All configuration of Apache is performed in the <CODE>src</CODE>
directory of the Apache distribution. Change into this directory.

<OL>
 <LI>
  Select modules to compile into Apache in the
  <CODE>Configuration</CODE> file. Uncomment lines corresponding to
  those optional modules you wish to include (among the AddModule lines
  at the bottom of the file), or add new lines corresponding to
  additional modules you have downloaded or written. (See <A
  HREF="misc/API.html">API.html</A> for preliminary docs on how to
  write Apache modules).  Advanced users can comment out some of the
  default modules if they are sure they will not need them (be careful
  though, since many of the default modules are vital for the correct
  operation and security of the server).
  <P>

  You should also read the instructions in the <CODE>Configuration</CODE>
  file to see if you need to set any of the <CODE>Rule</CODE> lines.


 <LI>
  Configure Apache for your operating system. Normally you can just
  run the <CODE>Configure</CODE> script as given below. However
  if this fails or you have any special requirements (<EM>e.g.</EM>, to include
  an additional library required by an optional module) you might need
  to edit one or more of the following options in the
  <CODE>Configuration</CODE> file:
    <CODE>EXTRA_CFLAGS, LIBS, LDFLAGS, INCLUDES</CODE>.
  <P>

  Run the <CODE>Configure</CODE> script:

  This generates a Makefile for use in stage 3. It also creates a
  Makefile in the support directory, for compilation of the optional
  support programs.
  <P>

  (If you want to maintain multiple configurations, you can give an
  option to <CODE>Configure</CODE> to tell it to read an alternative
  Configuration file, such as <CODE>Configure -file
  Configuration.ai</CODE>).
  <P>

 <LI>
  Type <CODE>make</CODE>.
</OL>

The modules we place in the Apache distribution are the ones we have
tested and are used regularly by various members of the Apache
development group.  Additional modules contributed by members or third
parties with specific needs or functions are available at
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.apache.org/dist/contrib/modules/"
    >http://www.apache.org/dist/contrib/modules/</A>&gt;.
There are instructions on that page for linking these modules into the
core Apache code.

<H2><A NAME="install">Installing Apache</A></H2>

You will have a binary file called <CODE>httpd</CODE> in the
<CODE>src</CODE> directory.  A binary distribution of Apache will
supply this file.  <P>

The next step is to install the program and configure it. Apache is
designed to be configured and run from the same set of directories
where it is compiled. If you want to run it from somewhere else, make
a directory and copy the <CODE>conf</CODE>, <CODE>logs</CODE> and
<CODE>icons</CODE> directories into it.  In either case you should
read the <A HREF="misc/security_tips.html#serverroot">security tips</A>
describing how to set the permissions on the server root directory.<P>

The next step is to edit the configuration files for the server. This
consists of setting up various <STRONG>directives</STRONG> in up to three
central configuration files. By default, these files are located in
the <CODE>conf</CODE> directory and are called <CODE>srm.conf</CODE>,
<CODE>access.conf</CODE> and <CODE>httpd.conf</CODE>.  To help you get
started there are same files in the <CODE>conf</CODE> directory of the
distribution, called <CODE>srm.conf-dist</CODE>,
<CODE>access.conf-dist</CODE> and <CODE>httpd.conf-dist</CODE>. Copy
or rename these files to the names without the <CODE>-dist</CODE>.
Then edit each of the files. Read the comments in each file carefully.
Failure to setup these files correctly could lead to your server not
working or being insecure. You should also have an additional file in
the <CODE>conf</CODE> directory called <CODE>mime.types</CODE>. This
file usually does not need editing.

<P>

First edit <CODE>httpd.conf</CODE>.  This sets up general attributes
about the server: the port number, the user it runs as, <EM>etc.</EM>  Next
edit the <CODE>srm.conf</CODE> file; this sets up the root of the
document tree, special functions like server-parsed HTML or internal
imagemap parsing, <EM>etc.</EM>  Finally, edit the <CODE>access.conf</CODE>
file to at least set the base cases of access.

<P>

In addition to these three files, the server behavior can be configured
on a directory-by-directory basis by using <CODE>.htaccess</CODE>
files in directories accessed by the server.

<H3>Set your system time properly!</H3>

Proper operation of a public web server requires accurate time
keeping, since elements of the HTTP protocol are expressed as the time
of day.  So, it's time to investigate setting up NTP or some other
time synchronization system on your Unix box, or whatever the
equivalent on NT would be.

<H2>Compiling Support Programs</H2>

In addition to the main <CODE>httpd</CODE> server which is compiled
and configured as above, Apache includes a number of support programs.
These are not compiled by default. The support programs are in the
<CODE>support</CODE> directory of the distribution. To compile
the support programs, change into this directory and type
<PRE>
    make

    <h2><a id="download" name="download">Downloading Apache</a></h2>

    <p>You may download the latest version of Apache either directly from the
    Apache web site, at <a
    href="http://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/">http://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/</a>,
    or from one of the many mirror sites, listed at <a
    href="http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi">http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi</a>.
    These sites will list the current release, and more recent beta releases,
    and have links to older versions, and binary distributions for a variety
    of platforms.</p>

    <h2><a id="intro" name="intro">Introduction</a></h2>

    <p>Like all good things, there are two ways to configure, compile, and
    install Apache. You can go for the 3-minute installation process using
    the APACI process described below; or, you can opt for the same mechanism
    used in previous versions of Apache, as described in the file
    'src/INSTALL'. Each mechanism has its benefits and drawbacks - APACI is
    newer and a little more raw, but it gets you up and running the least
    amount of time, whereas the "Configuration.tmpl" mechanism may be more
    familiar and give you some more flexibility to the power user. We'd be
    very interested in your comments and feedback regarding each
    approach.</p>

    <h2><a id="apaci" name="apaci">Installing the Apache 1.3 HTTP server with
    APACI</a></h2>

    <h3>Overview for the impatient</h3>
<pre>
     $ ./configure --prefix=PREFIX
     $ make
     $ make install
     $ PREFIX/bin/apachectl start
</pre>

    <p><b>NOTE:</b> <code>PREFIX</code> is not the string "PREFIX". Instead
    use the Unix filesystem path under which Apache should be installed. For
    instance use "<code>/usr/local/apache</code>" for PREFIX above.</p>

    <h3><a id="requirements" name="requirements">Requirements</a></h3>

    <p>The following requirements exist for building Apache:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt><b>Disk Space:</b></dt>

      <dd>Make sure you have approximately 12 MB of temporary free disk space
      available. After installation Apache occupies approximately 3 MB of
      disk space (the actual required disk space depends on the amount of
      compiled in third party modules, etc).</dd>

      <dt><b>ANSI-C Compiler:</b></dt>

      <dd>Make sure you have an ANSI-C compiler installed. The GNU C compiler
      (GCC) from the Free Software Foundation (FSF) is recommended (version
      2.7.2 is fine). If you don't have GCC then at least make sure your
      vendors compiler is ANSI compliant. You can find the homepage of GNU at
      http://www.gnu.org/ and the GCC distribution under
      http://www.gnu.org/order/ftp.html .</dd>

      <dt><b>Perl 5 Interpreter [OPTIONAL]:</b></dt>

      <dd>For some of the support scripts like `apxs' or `dbmmanage' (which
      are written in Perl) the Perl 5 interpreter is required (versions 5.003
      and 5.004 are fine). If no such interpreter is found by APACI's
      `configure' script this is no harm. Of course, you still can build and
      install Apache 1.3. Only those support scripts cannot be used. If you
      have multiple Perl interpreters installed (perhaps a Perl 4 from the
      vendor and a Perl 5 from your own), then it is recommended to use the
      --with-perl option (see below) to make sure the correct one is selected
      by APACI.</dd>

      <dt><b>Dynamic Shared Object (DSO) support [OPTIONAL]:</b></dt>

      <dd>
        <p>To provide maximum flexibility Apache now is able to load modules
        under runtime via the DSO mechanism by using the pragmatic
        dlopen()/dlsym() system calls. These system calls are not available
        under all operating systems therefore you cannot use the DSO
        mechanism on all platforms. And Apache currently has only limited
        built-in knowledge on how to compile shared objects because this is
        heavily platform-dependent. The current state is this:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Out-of-the-box supported platforms are: 

            <p>
            <table border="0">
              <tr>
                <td>Linux</td>
                <td>SunOS</td>
                <td>UnixWare</td>
                <td>Darwin/Mac OS</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>FreeBSD</td>
                <td>Solaris</td>
                <td>AIX</td>
                <td>OpenStep/Mach</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>OpenBSD</td>
                <td>IRIX</td>
                <td>SCO</td>
                <td>DYNIX/ptx</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>NetBSD</td>
                <td>HPUX</td>
                <td>ReliantUNIX</td>
                <td>BSDI</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Digital Unix</td>
                <td>DGUX</td>
              </tr>
            </table>
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            Entirely unsupported platforms are: 

            <p>Ultrix</p>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>If your system is not on these lists but has the dlopen-style
        interface, you either have to provide the appropriate compiler and
        linker flags (see CFLAGS_SHLIB, LDFLAGS_SHLIB and
        LDFLAGS_SHLIB_EXPORT below) manually or at least make sure a Perl 5
        interpreter is installed from which Apache can guess the options.</p>

        <p>For more in-depth information about DSO support in Apache 1.3
        please read the document htdocs/manual/dso.html carefully. Especially
        the section entitled "Advantages &amp; Disadvantages" because using
        the DSO mechanism can have strange side-effects if you are not
        carefully. BE WARNED!</p>
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <h3><a name="configure">Configuring the source tree</a></h3>

    <p>The next step is to configure the Apache source tree for your
    particular platform and personal requirements. The most important setup
    here is the location prefix where Apache is to be installed later,
    because Apache has to be configured for this location to work correctly.
    But there are a lot of other options available for your pleasure.</p>

    <p>For a short impression of what possibilities you have, here is a
    typical example which compiles Apache for the installation tree
    /sw/pkg/apache with a particular compiler and flags plus the two
    additional modules mod_rewrite and mod_proxy for later loading through
    the DSO mechanism:</p>
<pre>
     $ CC="pgcc" OPTIM="-O2" \
       ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/apache \
                   --enable-module=rewrite --enable-shared=rewrite \
                   --enable-module=proxy   --enable-shared=proxy
</pre>

    <p>For a complete list of the available options, type the following
    command:</p>
  <p><code>./configure --help</code></p>

 <p>See also the file <code>README.configure</code> for listings of
 example configurations.</p>

    <h3><a name="build">Building the package</a></h3>

    <p>Now you can build the various parts which form the Apache package by
    simply running the command</p>
<pre>
        $ make 
</pre>

    <p>Please be patient here, this takes approximately 2 minutes to complete
    under a Pentium-166/FreeBSD-2.2 system, dependent on the amount of
    modules you have enabled.</p>

    <h3><a name="installing">Installing the package</a></h3>

    <p>Now its time to install the package under the configured installation
    <code>PREFIX</code> (see the <code>--prefix</code> option above):</p>
<pre>
        $ make install
</pre>

   <p>In the following examples, <code>PREFIX</code> is not the literal string
       "PREFIX", but whatever argument you provided to
       the<code>--prefix</code> option.</p>

<!-- Building and installing Apache in the traditional way -->

    <h2><a name="traditional">Building and installing Apache in the traditional way</a></h2>

    Before the advent of APACI, there was just one way to build and
    install Apache. While APACI gave a configuration interface which is
    more familiar to some people, the older method gives a way to
    configure the installation without typing a large number of
    command-line options.

    <h3><a name="trad_configure">Configuring the installation</a></h3>

    Compiling Apache consists of three steps: Firstly select which
    Apache <strong>modules</strong> you want to include into the
    server. Secondly create a configuration for your operating
    system. Thirdly compile the executable. 

    <p>All configuration of Apache is performed in the
    <code>src</code> directory of the Apache distribution. Change
    into this directory.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Select modules to compile into Apache in the
        <code>Configuration</code> file. Uncomment lines
        corresponding to those optional modules you wish to include
        (among the AddModule lines at the bottom of the file), or
        add new lines corresponding to additional modules you have
        downloaded or written. (See <a
        href="misc/API.html">API.html</a> for preliminary docs on
        how to write Apache modules). Advanced users can comment
        out some of the default modules if they are sure they will
        not need them (be careful though, since many of the default
        modules are vital for the correct operation and security of
        the server). 

        <p>You should also read the instructions in the
        <code>Configuration</code> file to see if you need to set
        any of the <code>Rule</code> lines.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        Configure Apache for your operating system. Normally you
        can just run the <code>Configure</code> script as given
        below. However if this fails or you have any special
        requirements (<em>e.g.</em>, to include an additional
        library required by an optional module) you might need to
        edit one or more of the following options in the
        <code>Configuration</code> file: <code>EXTRA_CFLAGS, LIBS,
        LDFLAGS, INCLUDES</code>. 

        <p>Run the <code>Configure</code> script:</p>

        <blockquote>
<pre>
d99 2
a100 85
  
</pre>
        </blockquote>
        (*: Depending on Configuration and your system, Configure
        might not print these lines. That's OK). 

        <p>This generates a Makefile for use in stage 3. It also
        creates a Makefile in the support directory, for
        compilation of the optional support programs.</p>

        <p>(If you want to maintain multiple configurations, you
        can give an option to <code>Configure</code> to tell it to
        read an alternative Configuration file, such as
        <code>Configure -file Configuration.ai</code>).</p>

    <strong>directives</strong> in up to three central
    configuration files. By default, these files are located in the
    <code>conf</code> directory and are called
    <code>srm.conf</code>, <code>access.conf</code> and
    <code>httpd.conf</code>. To help you get started there are same
    files in the <code>conf</code> directory of the distribution,
    called <code>srm.conf-dist</code>,
    <code>access.conf-dist</code> and <code>httpd.conf-dist</code>.
    Copy or rename these files to the names without the
    <code>-dist</code>. Then edit each of the files. Read the
    comments in each file carefully. Failure to setup these files
    correctly could lead to your server not working or being
    insecure. You should also have an additional file in the
    <code>conf</code> directory called <code>mime.types</code>.
    This file usually does not need editing.</p>

    <p>First edit <code>httpd.conf</code>. This sets up general
    attributes about the server: the port number, the user it runs
    as, <em>etc.</em> Next edit the <code>srm.conf</code> file;
    this sets up the root of the document tree, special functions
    like server-parsed HTML or internal imagemap parsing,
    <em>etc.</em> Finally, edit the <code>access.conf</code> file
    to at least set the base cases of access.</p>

    <p>In addition to these three files, the server behavior can be
    configured on a directory-by-directory basis by using
    <code>.htaccess</code> files in directories accessed by the
    server.</p>

    <h3>Compiling Support Programs</h3>
    In addition to the main <code>httpd</code> server which is
    compiled and configured as above, Apache includes a number of
    support programs. These are not compiled by default. The
    support programs are in the <code>support</code> directory of
    the distribution. To compile the support programs, change into
    this directory and type 
<pre>
    make
</pre>

    <p>Now you can fire up your Apache HTTP server by immediately running</p>
<pre>
        $ PREFIX/bin/apachectl start
</pre>

    <p>and then you should be able to request your first document via URL
    http://localhost/ (when you built and installed Apache as root or at
    least used the --without-confadjust option) or http://localhost:8080/
    (when you built and installed Apache as a regular user). Then stop the
    server again by running:</p>
<pre>
        $ PREFIX/bin/apachectl stop
</pre>

    <h2><a name="time">Set your system time properly!</a></h2>
    Proper operation of a public web server requires accurate time
    keeping, since elements of the HTTP protocol are expressed as
    the time of day. So, it's time to investigate setting up NTP or
    some other time synchronization system on your Unix box, or
    the <code>net time</code> command on NT.
