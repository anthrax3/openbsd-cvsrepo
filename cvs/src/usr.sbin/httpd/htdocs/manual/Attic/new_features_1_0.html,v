    <h1 align="CENTER">Overview of new features</h1>

    <h2>New Features with Apache 1.0</h2>

    <p>New features with this release, as extensions of the Apache
    functionality (see also more detailed <code>CHANGES</code>
    file) in the source directory. Because the core code has
    changed so significantly, there are certain liberties that
    earlier versions of Apache (and the NCSA daemon) took that
    Apache 1.0 is pickier about - please check the <a
    href="misc/compat_notes.html">compatibility notes</a> if you
    have any problems.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        API for server extensions --- see below for a brief sermon
        on philosophy, or see <a
        href="misc/API.html">src/API.html</a> for an actual
        overview. Most server functionality (including includes,
        CGI, and most forms of access control) are actually
        implemented as API-conformant modules; you can also do
        other neat stuff (we've included a sample module, for
        instance, which one of us is using to track click-trails
        using the <a
        href="http://home.netscape.com/newsref/std/cookie_spec.html">
        Netscape cookie mechanism</a>, for visitors who come in
        through Netscape clients). <a
        href="mod/mod_dld.html">Modules</a> can also be loaded
        dynamically using GNU DLD. 

        <p>The API is not yet quite stable (see src/TODO for some
        possible changes), but anything done now will be easily
        adapted for future versions --- after all, we have more
        modules to adapt than you do.</p>
      </li>

      <li><a href="process-model.html">New Process Model - much
      less forking, no fixed number of children.</a> We found that
      many people were using values for "MaxServers" either too
      high or too low, and were hanging themselves on it. The model
      we adopted is still based on long-lived minimal-forking
      processes, but instead of specifying one number of persistent
      processes, the web-master specifies a maximum and minimum
      number of processes to be "spare" - every couple of seconds
      the parent checks the actual number of spare servers and
      adjusts accordingly. This should keep the number of servers
      concurrently running relatively low while still ensuring
      minimal forking.</li>

      <li><a href="vhosts/">&lt;VirtualHost&gt; (the configuration
      directive for multiple-homed servers)</a> is more general
      now. Just about any srm.conf or httpd.conf command can go in
      a &lt;Virtualhost&gt; section, with the following specific
      exceptions: ServerType, UserId, GroupId, StartServers,
      MaxRequestsPerChild, BindAddress, PidFile, TypesConfig,
      ServerRoot.</li>

      <li><a href="content-negotiation.html">Support for content
      negotiation of languages through MultiViews</a> (*.fr, *.de,
      *.en suffixes), via the new AddLanguage and LanguagePriority
      commands (code written by Florent Guillaume,
      guillaum@@clipper.ens.fr).</li>

      <li>Significant internal cleanups and rearrangements. The two
      externally visible consequences of this are that just about
      all of the unchecked fixed limits are gone, and that the
      server is somewhat pickier about config file syntax (noting
      and complaining about extraneous command arguments or other
      stuff at the end of command lines).</li>

      <li>XBITHACK is a run-time option, and can be selectively
      enabled per directory --- the -DXBITHACK compile-time option
      just changes the default. The command which configures it is
      "XBitHack", which is allowed everywhere "Options" is; this
      takes an argument --- "XBitHack Off" turns it off; "XBitHack
      On" gets you the NCSA -DXBITHACK behavior; and "XBitHack
      Full" gets you the Apache GXBIT stuff on top of that.
      (-DXBITHACK makes "Full" the default; otherwise, it defaults
      "Off").</li>

      <li>TransferLog can specify a program which gets the log
      entries piped to it, a la 'TransferLog "|
      /var/www/my-perl-script -arg valu"' --- this should give the
      same SIGTERM/pause/SIGKILL treatment to the logging process
      on server restarts that a CGI script gets on an aborted
      request. NB the server is counting on the logging process to
      work, and will probably hang or worse if it dies.</li>

      <li><a href="mod/mod_log_config.html">Configurable logging
      module</a> --- this is a replacement for the standard
      plane-jane Common Log Format code, which supports a LogFormat
      directive which allows you to control the formatting of
      entries in the TransferLog, and add some new items if you
      like (in particular, Referer and User-Agent).
      EXPERIMENTAL.</li>

      <li>Significant internal cleanups and rearrangements. The two
      externally visible consequences of this are that just about
      all of the unchecked fixed limits are gone, and that the
      server is somewhat pickier about config file syntax (noting
      and complaining about extraneous command arguments or other
      stuff at the end of command lines).</li>

      <li>XBITHACK is a run-time option, and can be selectively
      enabled per directory --- the -DXBITHACK compile-time option
      just changes the default. The command which configures it is
      "XBitHack", which is allowed everywhere "Options" is; this
      takes an argument --- "XBitHack Off" turns it off; "XBitHack
      On" gets you the NCSA -DXBITHACK behavior; and "XBitHack
      Full" gets you the Apache GXBIT stuff on top of that.
      (-DXBITHACK makes "Full" the default; otherwise, it defaults
      "Off").</li>

      <li>TransferLog can specify a program which gets the log
      entries piped to it, a la 'TransferLog "|
      /var/www/my-perl-script -arg valu"' --- this should give the
      same SIGTERM/pause/SIGKILL treatment to the logging process
      on server restarts that a CGI script gets on an aborted
      request. NB the server is counting on the logging process to
      work, and will probably hang or worse if it dies.</li>

      <li><a href="mod/mod_log_config.html">Configurable logging
      module</a> --- this is a replacement for the standard
      plane-jane Common Log Format code, which supports a LogFormat
      directive which allows you to control the formatting of
      entries in the TransferLog, and add some new items if you
      like (in particular, Referer and User-Agent).
      EXPERIMENTAL.</li>
