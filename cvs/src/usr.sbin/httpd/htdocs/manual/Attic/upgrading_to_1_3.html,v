    <h1 align="CENTER">Upgrading to 1.3 from 1.2</h1>

    <p>In order to assist folks upgrading we are now going to
    maintain a document describing information critical to existing
    Apache users. Note that it only lists differences between
    recent major releases, so for example, folks using Apache 1.1
    or earlier will have to figure out what changed up to Apache
    1.2 before this document can be considered relevant. Old users
    could look at the <code>src/CHANGES</code> file which tracks
    code changes.</p>

    <p>These are intended to be brief notes, and you should be able
    to find more information in either the <a
    href="new_features_1_3.html">New Features</a> document, or in
    the <code>src/CHANGES</code> file.</p>

    <h3>Compile-Time Configuration Changes</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>The source code has been <a
      href="sourcereorg.html">reorganized</a>, which affects anyone
      with custom modules or modifications. But also, the
      <code>Module</code> directive has been changed to the
      <code>AddModule</code> directive.</li>

      <li>The <code>Configuration</code> variable
      <code>EXTRA_LFLAGS</code> has been renamed
      <code>EXTRA_LDFLAGS</code>.</li>

      <li>The <code>-DMAXIMUM_DNS</code> definition has been
      obsoleted by changes to <code>mod_access</code> enforcing
      double-reverse DNS lookups when necessary.</li>

      <li>The <code>-DSERVER_SUBVERSION=\"string\"</code>
      compile-time option has been replaced with the run-time API
      call <code>ap_add_version_component()</code>. Compile-time
      modification of the server identity by the configuration
      scripts is no longer supported.</li>

      <li><code>mod_dir</code> has been split into two pieces
      <code><a
      href="mod/mod_autoindex.html">mod_autoindex</a></code>, and
      <code><a href="mod/mod_dir.html">mod_dir</a></code>.</li>

      <li><a
      href="mod/mod_browser.html"><code>mod_browser</code></a> has
      been replaced by <a
      href="mod/mod_setenvif.html"><code>mod_setenvif</code></a>.</li>

      <li>IRIX systems with untrusted users who can write CGIs
      which execute as the same uid as httpd should consider using
      <code>suexec</code>, or adding
      <code>-DUSE_FCNTL_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT</code> to
      <code>EXTRA_CFLAGS</code>. This is slower, more information
      is available on the <a
      href="misc/perf-tuning.html#serialize">performance tuning
      page</a>. There is a mild denial of service attack possible
      with the default config, but the default config is an order
      of magnitude faster.</li>

      <li><code>mod_auth_msql</code> has been removed from the
      distribution.</li>

      <li>The new Apache Autoconf-style Interface (APACI) was added
      to the top-level to provide a real out-of-the-box build and
      installation procedure for the complete Apache package.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Run-Time Configuration Changes</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>
        There have been numerous changes to the default config
        files. Ensure that you compare your existing configuration
        files with the new ones to ensure there aren't any
        undesired differences. In particular: 

        <ul>
          <li>As of Apache 1.3.0, the current config files apply
          different <a href="mod/core.html#options">Options</a> and
          <a href="mod/core.html#allowoverride">AllowOverride</a>
          settings to various directories than were used in
          1.2.</li>

          <li>As of the release following Apache 1.3.3, the three
          config file templates have been merged into
          <samp>httpd.conf-dist</samp> and the order of the
          directives changed.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>As of 1.3.2, <a
      href="mod/mod_expires.html"><code>mod_expires</code></a> will
      add Expires headers to content that does not come from a file
      on disk, unless you are using a modification time based
      setting. Previously, it would never add an Expires header
      unless content came from a file on disk. This could result in
      Expires headers being added in places where they were not
      previously added.</li>

      <li>Standalone <strong><samp>FancyIndexing</samp></strong>
      directives are now combined with the settings of any
      <samp>IndexOptions</samp> directive already in effect, rather
      than replacing them.</li>

      <li>
        <strong><samp>AuthName</samp> strings will need to be
        quoted</strong> in <samp>.htaccess</samp> or server
        configuration files if they contain blank characters (like
        spaces). For example, if you use an <samp>AuthName</samp>
        directive like this: 
<pre>
     AuthName This and That
   
</pre>
        you will need to change it to 
<pre>
     AuthName "This and That"
   
</pre>
        This change was made for consistency in the config
        language.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>As of Apache 1.3.1, methods listed in
        <samp>&lt;Limit&gt;</samp> directives must be
        uppercase.</strong> Method names, such as <samp>GET</samp>,
        <samp>POST</samp>, and <samp>PUT</samp> are defined as
        being case-sensitive. That is, a <samp>GET</samp> request
        is different from a <samp>get</samp> request. Prior to
        Apache 1.3.1, the <samp>&lt;Limit&gt;</samp> directive
        parser incorrectly treated both of these as being the same.
        Apache's built-in method limit processing currently only
        understands uppercase method names, so if you've used
        clauses such as
        "<samp>&lt;Limit&nbsp;Get&nbsp;post&gt;</samp>" in your
        configuration files, you need to correct them to use
        uppercase names. 

        <p>Unrecognized method names in the server configuration
        files will result in the server logging an error message
        and failing to start. In <samp>.htaccess</samp> files,
        unknown methods will cause the server to log an error to
        its error log and return an 'Internal Server Error' page to
        the client.</p>
      </li>

      <li><strong>The default Apache ServerRoot directory
      changed</strong> from the NCSA-compatible
      <samp>/usr/local/etc/httpd/</samp> to
      <samp>/usr/local/apache/</samp>. This change covers only the
      default setting (and the documentation); it is of course
      possible to override it using the <em>-d ServerRoot</em> and
      <em>-f httpd.conf</em> switches when starting apache.</li>

      <li>Folks using HTTP/1.1-style virtual hosting will need to
      list the ip:port pairs that are supposed to have
      HTTP/1.1-style virtual hosting via the <a
      href="mod/core.html#namevirtualhost"><code>NameVirtualHost</code></a>
      directive (one directive per pair). Previously this support
      was given implicitly on the "main server address". Now it has
      to be explicitly listed so as to avoid many problems that
      users had. Please see the <a href="vhosts/">Apache Virtual
      Host documentation</a> for further details on
      configuration.</li>

      <li>The precedence of virtual hosts has been reversed
      (applies mainly to vhosts using HTTP/1.1 Host: headers, and
      the <a href="mod/core.html#serverpath">ServerPath</a>
      directive). Now the earlier vhosts in the file have
      precedence over the later vhosts.</li>

      <li><code>HostnameLookups</code> defaults to Off.</li>

      <li><strong><samp>REMOTE_HOST</samp> CGI variable
      changed.</strong> In Apache 1.2 and earlier, the
      <samp>REMOTE_HOST</samp> environment variable made available
      to CGI scripts was set to either the full DNS name of the
      client, or else to the client's IP address if the name was
      not known. This behavior differed from that specified by the
      CGI specification, which defines this variable as being NULL
      if the name isn't known. In Apache 1.3, we have made this
      correction. <samp>REMOTE_ADDR</samp> always contains the
      client's IP address, but <samp>REMOTE_HOST</samp> is only
      defined when the server has been able to determine the
      client's DNS name.</li>

      <li>The undocumented <a
      href="mod/mod_access.html"><code>mod_access</code></a> syntax
      "allow user-agents" was removed. The replacement is the more
      general "allow from env".</li>

      <li>When using wildcards in pathnames (such as * and ?) they
      no longer match / (slash). That is, they more closely behave
      how a UNIX shell behaves. This affects
      <code>&lt;Directory&gt;</code> directives, for example.</li>

      <li>If no <code>TransferLog</code> directive is given then
      nothing will be logged. (Previously it would default to
      <code>logs/access_log</code>.)</li>

      <li>Apache now has <a
      href="mod/core.html#loglevel">configurable error logging
      levels</a>, and the default eliminates some messages that
      earlier versions always generated.</li>

      <li>When booting, Apache will now detach itself from stdin,
      stdout, and stderr. stderr will not be detached until after
      the config files have been read so you will be able to see
      initial error messages. After that all errors are logged in
      the error_log. This makes it more convenient to start Apache
      via rsh, ssh, or crontabs.</li>

      <li>&lt;Files&gt; sections previously could take a full
      pathname, and were matched against the full pathnames. This
      had some inconsistencies, and was removed. To emulate this
      older behavior use a &lt;Files&gt; section nested inside a
      &lt;Directory&gt; section.</li>

      <li>&lt;Location&gt; matching behavior with respect to
      slashes has changed. See the <a
      href="mod/core.html#location">&lt;Location&gt;
      documentation</a> for more info.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Misc Changes</h3>

    <ul>
      <li><code>ServerType inetd</code> has been deprecated. It
      still exists, but bugs are unlikely to be fixed.</li>

      <li><code>httpd_monitor</code> has been deprecated. The
      replacement is to use <code>mod_status</code> and make a
      request to a URL such as
      <code>http://myhost/server-status?refresh=10</code>.</li>

      <li>
        Apache now provides an effectively unbuffered connection
        for CGI scripts. This means that data will be sent to the
        client as soon as the CGI pauses or stops output;
        previously, Apache would buffer the output up to a fixed
        buffer size before sending, which could result in the user
        viewing an empty page until the CGI finished or output a
        complete buffer. It is no longer necessary to use an "nph-"
        CGI to get unbuffered output. Given that most CGIs are
        written in a language that by default does buffering
        (<em>e.g.</em>, perl) this shouldn't have a detrimental
        effect on performance. 

        <p>"nph-" CGIs, which formerly provided a direct socket to
        the client without any server post-processing, were not
        fully compatible with HTTP/1.1 or SSL support. As such they
        would have had to implement the transport details, such as
        encryption or chunking, in order to work properly in
        certain situations. Now, the only difference between nph
        and non-nph scripts is "non-parsed headers".</p>
      </li>

      <li><code>dbmmanage</code> has been overhauled.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Third Party Modules</h3>

    <p>The following changes between the 1.2 and 1.3 API may
    require slight changes in third party modules not maintained by
    Apache.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>To avoid symbol clashes with third-party code compiled
      into the server, the general prefix `<code>ap_</code>' was
      globally applied to the following classes of symbols: Apache
      provided general functions (<em>e.g.</em>,
      <code>ap_cpystrn</code>), public API functions
      (<em>e.g.</em>, <code>palloc</code>, <code>bgets</code>) and
      private functions which can't be made static (because of
      cross-object usage) but should be (<em>e.g.</em>,
      <code>new_connection</code>). For backward source
      compatibility with Apache 1.2 a new header file named
      <code>compat.h</code> was created which provides defines for
      the old symbol names. You'll either have to <code>#include
      compat.h</code> or update the API symbols you use.</li>

      <li>Be sure and examine the <a href="sourcereorg.html">source
      code reorganization page</a> to see whether any item there
      affects you.</li>

      <li>Use of <samp>SERVER_VERSION</samp> definition. If
      third-party modules reference the server version string using
      this symbol, they should be corrected to obtain it by calling
      the new API routine
      <code>const&nbsp;char&nbsp;*ap_get_server_version()</code>.</li>

      <li><code>ap_construct_url</code> prototype change. The
      second parameter was previously a <code>server_rec</code>, it
      has been changed to a <code>request_rec</code>.</li>

      <li>
        The <code>table</code> datatype has been made an opaque
        type. Code which assumes a <code>table</code> is the same
        as an <code>array_header</code> will not compile. This is
        actually a change to enforce the API the way it was
        intended, all versions of Apache have had a
        <code>table_elts()</code> function which is intended for
        code which needs to access the elements of a table. The
        changes required for this are pretty easy, and work with
        all versions of Apache. 

        <p>Suppose <code>t</code> is a table. Whenever code refers
        to <code>t-&gt;elts</code>, replace it with something like
        this:</p>

        <blockquote>
<pre>
    array_header *arr = table_elts(t);
    table_entry *elts = (table_entry *)arr-&gt;elts;
</pre>
        </blockquote>
        Whenever code refers to <code>t-&gt;nelts</code> use
        <code>arr-&gt;nelts</code>. Many examples can be found in
        the standard modules, search for <code>table_elts</code>.
      </li>
    </ul>

    are now combined with the settings of any <SAMP>IndexOptions</SAMP>
    directive already in effect, rather than replacing them.
  </LI>
  <LI><STRONG><SAMP>AuthName</SAMP> strings will need to be quoted</STRONG>
    in <SAMP>.htaccess</SAMP> or server configuration files if they contain
    blank characters (like spaces). For example, if you use
    an <SAMP>AuthName</SAMP> directive like this:
    
    <PRE>
d135 4
a138 5
    </PRE>
    
    you will need to change it to
    
    <PRE>
a139 82
    </PRE>
    
    This change was made for consistency in the config language.
  <LI><STRONG>As of Apache 1.3.1, methods listed in <SAMP>&lt;Limit&gt;</SAMP>
    directives must be uppercase.</STRONG>  Method names, such as
    <SAMP>GET</SAMP>, <SAMP>POST</SAMP>, and <SAMP>PUT</SAMP> are
    defined as being case-sensitive.  That is, a <SAMP>GET</SAMP>
    request is different from a <SAMP>get</SAMP> request.  Prior
    to Apache 1.3.1, the <SAMP>&lt;Limit&gt;</SAMP> directive
    parser incorrectly treated both of these as being the same.
    Apache's built-in method limit processing currently only understands
    uppercase method names, so if you've used clauses such as
    "<SAMP>&lt;Limit&nbsp;Get&nbsp;post&gt;</SAMP>" in your configuration
    files, you need to correct them to use uppercase names.
    <P>
    Unrecognized method names in the server configuration files will
    result in the server logging an error message and failing to start.
    In <SAMP>.htaccess</SAMP> files, unknown methods will cause the
    server to log an error to its error log and return an 'Internal
    Server Error' page to the client.
    </P>
  </LI>
  <LI><STRONG>The default Apache ServerRoot directory changed</STRONG>
    from the NCSA-compatible <SAMP>/usr/local/etc/httpd/</SAMP> to
    <SAMP>/usr/local/apache/</SAMP>. This change covers only the default
    setting (and the documentation); it is of course possible to override it
    using the <EM>-d ServerRoot</EM> and <EM>-f httpd.conf</EM> switches
    when starting apache.

  <LI>Folks using HTTP/1.1-style virtual hosting will need to list the
    ip:port pairs that are supposed to have HTTP/1.1-style virtual hosting
    via the <A HREF="mod/core.html#namevirtualhost"><CODE>
    NameVirtualHost</CODE></A> directive (one directive per pair).
    Previously this support was given implicitly on the "main server
    address".  Now it has to be explicitly listed so as to avoid many
    problems that users had.
    Please see the <A HREF="vhosts/">Apache Virtual Host
    documentation</A> for further details on configuration.

  <LI>The precedence of virtual hosts has been reversed (applies mainly to
    vhosts using HTTP/1.1 Host: headers, and the
    <A HREF="mod/core.html#serverpath">ServerPath</A> directive).  Now
    the earlier vhosts in the file have precedence over the later vhosts.

  <LI><CODE>HostnameLookups</CODE> defaults to Off.

  <LI><STRONG><SAMP>REMOTE_HOST</SAMP> CGI variable changed.</STRONG>
    In Apache 1.2 and earlier, the <SAMP>REMOTE_HOST</SAMP> environment
    variable made available to CGI scripts was set to either the
    full DNS name of the client, or else to the client's IP address
    if the name was not known.  This behaviour differed from that
    specified by the CGI specification, which defines this variable as being
    NULL if the name isn't known.  In Apache 1.3, we have made this correction.
    <SAMP>REMOTE_ADDR</SAMP> always contains the client's IP address,
    but <SAMP>REMOTE_HOST</SAMP> is only defined when the server has
    been able to determine the client's DNS name.
  </LI>

  <LI>The undocumented
    <A HREF="mod/mod_access.html"><CODE>mod_access</CODE></A>
    syntax "allow user-agents" was removed.  The replacement is the
    more general "allow from env".

  <LI>When using wildcards in pathnames (such as * and ?) they no longer
    match / (slash).  That is, they more closely behave how a UNIX shell
    behaves.  This affects <CODE>&lt;Directory&gt;</CODE> directives,
    for example.

  <LI>If no <CODE>TransferLog</CODE> directive is given then nothing will
    be logged.
    (Previously it would default to <CODE>logs/access_log</CODE>.)

  <LI>Apache now has <A HREF="mod/core.html#loglevel">configurable error
    logging levels</A>, and the default eliminates some messages that
    earlier versions always generated.

  <LI>When booting, Apache will now detach itself from stdin, stdout,
     and stderr.  stderr will not be detached until after the config
     files have been read so you will be able to see initial error
     messages.  After that all errors are logged in the error_log.
     This makes it more convenient to start Apache via rsh, ssh,
     or crontabs.

  <LI>&lt;Files&gt; sections previously could take a full pathname, and
     were matched against the full pathnames.  This had some
     inconsistencies, and was removed.  To emulate this older behaviour
     use a &lt;Files&gt; section nested inside a &lt;Directory&gt;
     section.

  <LI>&lt;Location&gt; matching behaviour with respect to slashes has
     changed.  See the <A HREF="mod/core.html#location">&lt;Location&gt;
     documentation</A> for more info.

</UL>

<H3>Misc Changes</H3>

<UL>
  <LI><CODE>ServerType inetd</CODE> has been deprecated.  It still exists,
    but bugs are unlikely to be fixed.

  <LI><CODE>httpd_monitor</CODE> has been deprecated.  The replacement is
    to use <CODE>mod_status</CODE> and make a request to a URL such as
    <CODE>http://myhost/server-status?refresh=10</CODE>.

  <LI>
    Apache now provides an effectively unbuffered connection for
    CGI scripts.  This means that data will be sent to the client
    as soon as the CGI pauses or stops output; previously, Apache would
    buffer the output up to a fixed buffer size before sending, which
    could result in the user viewing an empty page until the CGI finished
    or output a complete buffer.  It is no longer necessary to use an
    "nph-" CGI to get unbuffered output.  Given that most CGIs are written
    in a language that by default does buffering (<EM>e.g.</EM>, perl) this
    shouldn't have a detrimental effect on performance.

    <P>"nph-" CGIs, which formerly provided a direct socket to the client
    without any server post-processing, were not fully compatible with
    HTTP/1.1 or SSL support.  As such they would have had to implement
    the transport details, such as encryption or chunking, in order
    to work properly in certain situations.  Now, the only difference
    between nph and non-nph scripts is "non-parsed headers".

  <LI>
    <CODE>dbmmanage</CODE> has been overhauled.

</UL>

<H3>Third Party Modules</H3>

<P>The following changes between the 1.2 and 1.3 API may require slight
changes in third party modules not maintained by Apache.

<UL>
  <LI>
   To avoid symbol clashes with third-party code compiled into the server, the
   general prefix `<CODE>ap_</CODE>' was globally applied to the following
   classes of symbols: Apache provided general functions (<EM>e.g.</EM>,
   <CODE>ap_cpystrn</CODE>), public API functions (<EM>e.g.</EM>,
   <CODE>palloc</CODE>,
   <CODE>bgets</CODE>) and private functions which can't be made static
   (because of cross-object usage) but should be (<EM>e.g.</EM>,
   <CODE>new_connection</CODE>).  For backward source compatibility with
   Apache 1.2 a new header file named <CODE>compat.h</CODE> was created which
   provides defines for the old symbol names.
   You'll either have to <CODE>#include compat.h</CODE> or update the API
   symbols you use.
  </LI>
  <LI>
   Be sure and examine the <A HREF="sourcereorg.html">source code
   reorganization page</A> to see whether any item there affects you.
  </LI>

  <LI>Use of <SAMP>SERVER_VERSION</SAMP> definition.  If third-party
   modules reference the server version string using this symbol,
   they should be corrected to obtain it by calling the new API routine
   <CODE>const&nbsp;char&nbsp;*ap_get_server_version()</CODE>.
  </LI>

  <LI><CODE>ap_construct_url</CODE> prototype change.  The second parameter
    was previously a <CODE>server_rec</CODE>, it has been changed to
    a <CODE>request_rec</CODE>.

  <LI>The <CODE>table</CODE> datatype has been made an opaque type.
    Code which assumes a <CODE>table</CODE> is the same as an
    <CODE>array_header</CODE> will not compile.  This is actually a
    change to enforce the API the way it was intended, all versions
    of Apache have had a <CODE>table_elts()</CODE> function which
    is intended for code which needs to access the elements of
    a table.  The changes required for this are pretty easy, and
    work with all versions of Apache.

    <P>Suppose <CODE>t</CODE> is a table.  Whenever code refers to
    <CODE>t-&gt;elts</CODE>, replace it with something like this:
d334 2
a335 1
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
d338 8
a345 8
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

    Whenever code refers to <CODE>t-&gt;nelts</CODE> use
    <CODE>arr-&gt;nelts</CODE>.  Many examples can be found in
    the standard modules, search for <CODE>table_elts</CODE>.

    </div>



    <h1 align="CENTER">Upgrading to 1.3 from 1.2</h1>

    <p>In order to assist folks upgrading we are now going to
    maintain a document describing information critical to existing
    Apache users. Note that it only lists differences between
    recent major releases, so for example, folks using Apache 1.1
    or earlier will have to figure out what changed up to Apache
    1.2 before this document can be considered relevant. Old users
    could look at the <code>src/CHANGES</code> file which tracks
    code changes.</p>

    <p>These are intended to be brief notes, and you should be able
    to find more information in either the <a
    href="new_features_1_3.html">New Features</a> document, or in
    the <code>src/CHANGES</code> file.</p>

    <h3>Compile-Time Configuration Changes</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>The source code has been <a
      href="sourcereorg.html">reorganized</a>, which affects anyone
      with custom modules or modifications. But also, the
      <code>Module</code> directive has been changed to the
      <code>AddModule</code> directive.</li>

      <li>The <code>Configuration</code> variable
      <code>EXTRA_LFLAGS</code> has been renamed
      <code>EXTRA_LDFLAGS</code>.</li>

      <li>The <code>-DMAXIMUM_DNS</code> definition has been
      obsoleted by changes to <code>mod_access</code> enforcing
      double-reverse DNS lookups when necessary.</li>

      <li>The <code>-DSERVER_SUBVERSION=\"string\"</code>
      compile-time option has been replaced with the run-time API
      call <code>ap_add_version_component()</code>. Compile-time
      modification of the server identity by the configuration
      scripts is no longer supported.</li>

      <li><code>mod_dir</code> has been split into two pieces
      <code><a
      href="mod/mod_autoindex.html">mod_autoindex</a></code>, and
      <code><a href="mod/mod_dir.html">mod_dir</a></code>.</li>

      <li><a
      href="mod/mod_browser.html"><code>mod_browser</code></a> has
      been replaced by <a
      href="mod/mod_setenvif.html"><code>mod_setenvif</code></a>.</li>

      <li>IRIX systems with untrusted users who can write CGIs
      which execute as the same uid as httpd should consider using
      <code>suexec</code>, or adding
      <code>-DUSE_FCNTL_SERIALIZED_ACCEPT</code> to
      <code>EXTRA_CFLAGS</code>. This is slower, more information
      is available on the <a
      href="misc/perf-tuning.html#serialize">performance tuning
      page</a>. There is a mild denial of service attack possible
      with the default config, but the default config is an order
      of magnitude faster.</li>

      <li><code>mod_auth_msql</code> has been removed from the
      distribution.</li>

      <li>The new Apache Autoconf-style Interface (APACI) was added
      to the top-level to provide a real out-of-the-box build and
      installation procedure for the complete Apache package.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Run-Time Configuration Changes</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>
        There have been numerous changes to the default config
        files. Ensure that you compare your existing configuration
        files with the new ones to ensure there aren't any
        undesired differences. In particular: 

        <ul>
          <li>As of Apache 1.3.0, the current config files apply
          different <a href="mod/core.html#options">Options</a> and
          <a href="mod/core.html#allowoverride">AllowOverride</a>
          settings to various directories than were used in
          1.2.</li>

          <li>As of the release following Apache 1.3.3, the three
          config file templates have been merged into
          <samp>httpd.conf-dist</samp> and the order of the
          directives changed.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>As of 1.3.2, <a
      href="mod/mod_expires.html"><code>mod_expires</code></a> will
      add Expires headers to content that does not come from a file
      on disk, unless you are using a modification time based
      setting. Previously, it would never add an Expires header
      unless content came from a file on disk. This could result in
      Expires headers being added in places where they were not
      previously added.</li>

      <li>Standalone <strong><samp>FancyIndexing</samp></strong>
      directives are now combined with the settings of any
      <samp>IndexOptions</samp> directive already in effect, rather
      than replacing them.</li>

      <li>
        <strong><samp>AuthName</samp> strings will need to be
        quoted</strong> in <samp>.htaccess</samp> or server
        configuration files if they contain blank characters (like
        spaces). For example, if you use an <samp>AuthName</samp>
        directive like this: 
<pre>
d98 5
a102 4
   
</pre>
        you will need to change it to 
<pre>
d104 82
d187 91
a277 192
</pre>
        This change was made for consistency in the config
        language.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>As of Apache 1.3.1, methods listed in
        <samp>&lt;Limit&gt;</samp> directives must be
        uppercase.</strong> Method names, such as <samp>GET</samp>,
        <samp>POST</samp>, and <samp>PUT</samp> are defined as
        being case-sensitive. That is, a <samp>GET</samp> request
        is different from a <samp>get</samp> request. Prior to
        Apache 1.3.1, the <samp>&lt;Limit&gt;</samp> directive
        parser incorrectly treated both of these as being the same.
        Apache's built-in method limit processing currently only
        understands uppercase method names, so if you've used
        clauses such as
        "<samp>&lt;Limit&nbsp;Get&nbsp;post&gt;</samp>" in your
        configuration files, you need to correct them to use
        uppercase names. 

        <p>Unrecognized method names in the server configuration
        files will result in the server logging an error message
        and failing to start. In <samp>.htaccess</samp> files,
        unknown methods will cause the server to log an error to
        its error log and return an 'Internal Server Error' page to
        the client.</p>
      </li>

      <li><strong>The default Apache ServerRoot directory
      changed</strong> from the NCSA-compatible
      <samp>/usr/local/etc/httpd/</samp> to
      <samp>/usr/local/apache/</samp>. This change covers only the
      default setting (and the documentation); it is of course
      possible to override it using the <em>-d ServerRoot</em> and
      <em>-f httpd.conf</em> switches when starting apache.</li>

      <li>Folks using HTTP/1.1-style virtual hosting will need to
      list the ip:port pairs that are supposed to have
      HTTP/1.1-style virtual hosting via the <a
      href="mod/core.html#namevirtualhost"><code>NameVirtualHost</code></a>
      directive (one directive per pair). Previously this support
      was given implicitly on the "main server address". Now it has
      to be explicitly listed so as to avoid many problems that
      users had. Please see the <a href="vhosts/">Apache Virtual
      Host documentation</a> for further details on
      configuration.</li>

      <li>The precedence of virtual hosts has been reversed
      (applies mainly to vhosts using HTTP/1.1 Host: headers, and
      the <a href="mod/core.html#serverpath">ServerPath</a>
      directive). Now the earlier vhosts in the file have
      precedence over the later vhosts.</li>

      <li><code>HostnameLookups</code> defaults to Off.</li>

      <li><strong><samp>REMOTE_HOST</samp> CGI variable
      changed.</strong> In Apache 1.2 and earlier, the
      <samp>REMOTE_HOST</samp> environment variable made available
      to CGI scripts was set to either the full DNS name of the
      client, or else to the client's IP address if the name was
      not known. This behavior differed from that specified by the
      CGI specification, which defines this variable as being NULL
      if the name isn't known. In Apache 1.3, we have made this
      correction. <samp>REMOTE_ADDR</samp> always contains the
      client's IP address, but <samp>REMOTE_HOST</samp> is only
      defined when the server has been able to determine the
      client's DNS name.</li>

      <li>The undocumented <a
      href="mod/mod_access.html"><code>mod_access</code></a> syntax
      "allow user-agents" was removed. The replacement is the more
      general "allow from env".</li>

      <li>When using wildcards in pathnames (such as * and ?) they
      no longer match / (slash). That is, they more closely behave
      how a UNIX shell behaves. This affects
      <code>&lt;Directory&gt;</code> directives, for example.</li>

      <li>If no <code>TransferLog</code> directive is given then
      nothing will be logged. (Previously it would default to
      <code>logs/access_log</code>.)</li>

      <li>Apache now has <a
      href="mod/core.html#loglevel">configurable error logging
      levels</a>, and the default eliminates some messages that
      earlier versions always generated.</li>

      <li>When booting, Apache will now detach itself from stdin,
      stdout, and stderr. stderr will not be detached until after
      the config files have been read so you will be able to see
      initial error messages. After that all errors are logged in
      the error_log. This makes it more convenient to start Apache
      via rsh, ssh, or crontabs.</li>

      <li>&lt;Files&gt; sections previously could take a full
      pathname, and were matched against the full pathnames. This
      had some inconsistencies, and was removed. To emulate this
      older behavior use a &lt;Files&gt; section nested inside a
      &lt;Directory&gt; section.</li>

      <li>&lt;Location&gt; matching behavior with respect to
      slashes has changed. See the <a
      href="mod/core.html#location">&lt;Location&gt;
      documentation</a> for more info.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Misc Changes</h3>

    <ul>
      <li><code>ServerType inetd</code> has been deprecated. It
      still exists, but bugs are unlikely to be fixed.</li>

      <li><code>httpd_monitor</code> has been deprecated. The
      replacement is to use <code>mod_status</code> and make a
      request to a URL such as
      <code>http://myhost/server-status?refresh=10</code>.</li>

      <li>
        Apache now provides an effectively unbuffered connection
        for CGI scripts. This means that data will be sent to the
        client as soon as the CGI pauses or stops output;
        previously, Apache would buffer the output up to a fixed

        and non-nph scripts is "non-parsed headers".</p>
      </li>

      <li><code>dbmmanage</code> has been overhauled.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Third Party Modules</h3>

    <p>The following changes between the 1.2 and 1.3 API may
    require slight changes in third party modules not maintained by
    Apache.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>To avoid symbol clashes with third-party code compiled
      into the server, the general prefix `<code>ap_</code>' was
      globally applied to the following classes of symbols: Apache
      provided general functions (<em>e.g.</em>,
      <code>ap_cpystrn</code>), public API functions
      (<em>e.g.</em>, <code>palloc</code>, <code>bgets</code>) and
      private functions which can't be made static (because of
      cross-object usage) but should be (<em>e.g.</em>,
      <code>new_connection</code>). For backward source
      compatibility with Apache 1.2 a new header file named
      <code>compat.h</code> was created which provides defines for
      the old symbol names. You'll either have to <code>#include
      compat.h</code> or update the API symbols you use.</li>

      <li>Be sure and examine the <a href="sourcereorg.html">source
      code reorganization page</a> to see whether any item there
      affects you.</li>

      <li>Use of <samp>SERVER_VERSION</samp> definition. If
      third-party modules reference the server version string using
      this symbol, they should be corrected to obtain it by calling
      the new API routine
      <code>const&nbsp;char&nbsp;*ap_get_server_version()</code>.</li>

      <li><code>ap_construct_url</code> prototype change. The
      second parameter was previously a <code>server_rec</code>, it
      has been changed to a <code>request_rec</code>.</li>

        The <code>table</code> datatype has been made an opaque
        type. Code which assumes a <code>table</code> is the same
        as an <code>array_header</code> will not compile. This is
        actually a change to enforce the API the way it was
        intended, all versions of Apache have had a
        <code>table_elts()</code> function which is intended for
        code which needs to access the elements of a table. The
        changes required for this are pretty easy, and work with
        all versions of Apache. 

        <p>Suppose <code>t</code> is a table. Whenever code refers
        to <code>t-&gt;elts</code>, replace it with something like
        this:</p>

        <blockquote>
<pre>
d282 8
a289 8
</pre>
        </blockquote>
        Whenever code refers to <code>t-&gt;nelts</code> use
        <code>arr-&gt;nelts</code>. Many examples can be found in
        the standard modules, search for <code>table_elts</code>.
