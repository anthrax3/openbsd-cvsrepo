      <h3>Apache HTTP Server</h3>
    </div>



    <h1 align="CENTER">Overview of new features</h1>

    <h2>API Changes</h2>

    <p>Some non-compatible changes were made to the Apache API in
    order to deal with HTTP/1.1 compatibility. It is possible that
    some modules will no longer work (specifically, those that
    process input using the POST or PUT methods). If you encounter
    a module that does not work, please contact the author. A <a
    href="misc/client_block_api.html">programmer's note</a> on the
    subject is available.</p>

    <p>Additionally, some changes were made to the CGI environment
    that may cause some CGI scripts to work incorrectly. If you are
    experiencing trouble with a CGI that worked fine under Apache
    1.1.1, please see <a href="cgi_path.html">our explanation of
    the changes.</a></p>

    <h2>New Features with Apache 1.2</h2>

    <p>New features with this release, as extensions of the Apache
    functionality. Because the core code has changed so
    significantly, there are certain liberties that earlier
    versions of Apache (and the NCSA daemon) took that recent
    Apache versions are pickier about - please check the <a
    href="misc/compat_notes.html">compatibility notes</a> if you
    have any problems.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>In addition to a number of bug fixes and internal
    performance enhancements, <a
    href="http://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/">Apache 1.2</a> has the
    following specific new user features:</p>

    <ul>
      <!-- change the "name" to an "href" if/when there's such a document -->

      <li><strong><a id="http11.html" name="http11.html">HTTP/1.1
      Compliance</a></strong> [Documentation to be written]<br />
       Aside from the optional proxy module (which operates as
      HTTP/1.0), Apache is conditionally compliant with the
      HTTP/1.1 proposed standard, as approved by the IESG and the
      <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/http/">IETF HTTP
      working group</a>. HTTP/1.1 provides a much-improved
      protocol, and should allow for greater performance and
      efficiency when transferring files. Apache does, however,
      still work great with HTTP/1.0 browsers. We are very close to
      being unconditionally compliant; if you note any deviance
      from the proposed standard, please report it as a bug.</li>

      <li><strong><a href="mod/mod_include.html">eXtended Server
      Side Includes (XSSI)</a></strong><br />
       A new set of server-side include directives allows the user
      to better create WWW pages. This includes number of powerful
      new features, such as the ability to set variables and use
      conditional HTML.</li>

      <li><strong><a href="mod/core.html#files">File-based and
      Regex-enabled Directive Sections</a></strong><br />
       The new <a
      href="mod/core.html#files"><code>&lt;Files&gt;</code></a>
      section allows directives to be enabled based on full
      filename, not just directory and URL. In addition,
      <code>&lt;Files&gt;</code> sections can appear in
      <code>.htaccess</code> files. <code>&lt;Files&gt;</code>,
      along with <a
      href="mod/core.html#directory"><code>&lt;Directory&gt;</code></a>
      and <a
      href="mod/core.html#location"><code>&lt;Location&gt;</code></a>,
      can also now be based on regular expressions, not just simple
      prefix matching.</li>

      <li><strong><a href="mod/mod_browser.html">Browser-based
      Environment Variables</a></strong><br />
       Environment variables can now be set based on the
      <code>User-Agent</code> string of the browser. Combined with
      <a href="mod/mod_include.html">XSSI</a>, this allows you to
      write browser-based conditional HTML documents.</li>

      <li><strong><a href="suexec.html">SetUID CGI
      Execution</a></strong><br />
       Apache now supports the execution of CGI scripts as users
      other than the server user. A number of security checks are
      built in to try and make this as safe as possible.</li>

      <li><strong><a href="mod/mod_rewrite.html">URL Rewriting
      Module</a></strong><br />
       The optional <code>mod_rewrite</code> module is now
      included. This module can provide powerful URL mapping, using
      regular expressions. There's nothing this module can't
      do!</li>

      <li><strong><a href="mod/mod_log_config.html">Enhanced,
      Configurable Logging</a></strong><br />
       The optional <code>mod_log_config</code> included with
      earlier versions of Apache is now standard, and has been
      enhanced to allow logging of much more detail about the
      transaction, and can be used to open <a
      href="multilogs.html">more than one log file</a> at once
      (each of which can have a different log format). If you have
      Apache write any logs to a directory which is writable by
      anyone other than the user that starts the server, see the <a
      href="misc/security_tips.html">security tips</a> document to
      be sure you aren't putting the security of your server at
      risk.</li>

      <li><strong><a href="mod/mod_usertrack.html">User Tracking
      (Cookies) Revisions</a></strong><br />
       The <code>mod_cookies</code> included with previous versions
      of Apache has been renamed <code>mod_usertrack</code>, to
      more accurately reflect its function (some people
      inadvertently thought it enabled cookie support in Apache,
      which is not true - Apache supports the use of cookies
      directly). It is also now possible to disable the generation
      of cookies, even when the cookie module is compiled in. Also,
      an expiry time can be set on the cookies.</li>

      <li><strong><a
      href="mod/core.html#virtualhost">&lt;VirtualHost&gt;
      Enhancements</a></strong><br />
       The &lt;VirtualHost&gt; directive can now take more than one
      IP address or hostname. This lets a single vhost handles
      requests for multiple IPs or hostnames. Also the special
      section &lt;VirtualHost _default_&gt; can be used to handle
      requests normally left for the main server
      configuration.</li>

      <li><strong><a href="mod/mod_cgi.html#cgi_debug">CGI
      Debugging Environment</a></strong><br />
       <code>ScriptLog</code> allows you to now set up a log that
      records all input and output to failed CGI scripts. This
      includes environment variables, input headers, POST data,
      output, and more. This makes CGI scripts much easier to
      debug.</li>

      <li><strong><a href="mod/core.html#rlimit">Resource Limits
      for CGI Scripts</a></strong><br />
       New directives allow the limiting of resources used by CGI
      scripts (<em>e.g.</em>, max CPU time). This is helpful in
      preventing 'runaway' CGI processes.</li>

      <li><strong><a href="mod/mod_alias.html">Redirect Directive
      Can Return Alternate Status</a></strong><br />
       The Redirect directive can return permanent or temporary
      redirects, "Gone" or "See Other" HTTP status. For
      NCSA-compatibility, RedirectTemp and RedirectPermanent are
      also implemented.</li>

      <li><strong><a href="install.html">Simplified
      Compilation</a></strong><br />
       The process of configuring Apache for compilation has been
      simplified.</li>

      <li><strong><a href="mod/core.html#options">Add or Remove
      Options</a></strong><br />
       The <code>Options</code> directive can now add or remove
      options from those currently in force, rather than always
      replacing them.</li>

      <li><strong><a href="invoking.html#help">Command-line
      Help</a></strong><br />
       The <code>-h</code> command-line option now lists all the
      available directives.</li>

      <li><strong><a href="mod/mod_headers.html">Optional Headers
      Module to Set or Remove HTTP Headers</a></strong><br />
       The optional <code>mod_headers</code> module can be used to
      set custom headers in the HTTP response. It can append to
      existing headers, replace them, or remove headers from the
      response.</li>

      <li><strong><a href="mod/core.html#ifmodule">Conditional
      Config Directives</a></strong><br />
       A new <code>&lt;IfModule&gt;</code> section allows
      directives to be enabled only if a given module is loaded
      into the server.</li>

      <li><strong><a href="mod/core.html#satisfy">NCSA Satisfy
      authentication directive now implemented</a></strong><br />
       <code>Satisfy</code> allows for more flexible access control
      configurations.</li>

      <li><strong>Better NCSA Compatibility</strong><br />
       Apache directives are now more compatible with NCSA 1.5 to
      make moving between servers easier. In particular, Apache now
      implements the <a
      href="mod/core.html#satisfy"><code>Satisfy</code></a>, <a
      href="mod/core.html#maxkeepaliverequests">MaxKeepAliveRequests</a>,
      <a
      href="mod/mod_alias.html#redirectperm">RedirectPermanent</a>
      and <a
      href="mod/mod_alias.html#redirecttemp">RedirectTemp</a>,
      directives, and the following directives are now
      syntax-compatible with NCSA: <a
      href="mod/mod_auth.html#authuserfile">AuthUserFile</a>, <a
      href="mod/mod_auth.html#authgroupfile">AuthGroupFile</a>, <a
      href="mod/mod_digest.html#authdigestfile">AuthDigestFile</a>,
      <a href="mod/core.html#keepalive">KeepAlive</a> and <a
      href="mod/core.html#keepalivetimeout">KeepAliveTimeout</a>.</li>

      <li>
        <strong><a href="mod/mod_proxy.html">Optional proxy
        module</a></strong><br />
         An improved FTP, HTTP, and CONNECT mode SSL proxy is
        included with Apache 1.2. Some of the changes visible to
        users: 

        <dl>
          <dd>
            <dl>
              <dt>- Improved FTP proxy supporting PASV mode</dt>

              <dt>- ProxyBlock directive for excluding sites to
              proxy</dt>

              <dt>- NoCache * directive for disabling proxy
              caching</dt>

              <dt>- Numerous bug fixes</dt>
            </dl>

    <h1 align="CENTER">Overview of new features</h1>

    <h2>API Changes</h2>

    <p>Some non-compatible changes were made to the Apache API in
    order to deal with HTTP/1.1 compatibility. It is possible that
    some modules will no longer work (specifically, those that
    process input using the POST or PUT methods). If you encounter
    a module that does not work, please contact the author. A <a
    href="misc/client_block_api.html">programmer's note</a> on the
    subject is available.</p>

    <p>Additionally, some changes were made to the CGI environment
    that may cause some CGI scripts to work incorrectly. If you are
    experiencing trouble with a CGI that worked fine under Apache
    1.1.1, please see <a href="cgi_path.html">our explanation of
    the changes.</a></p>

    <h2>New Features with Apache 1.2</h2>

    <p>New features with this release, as extensions of the Apache
    functionality. Because the core code has changed so
    significantly, there are certain liberties that earlier
    versions of Apache (and the NCSA daemon) took that recent
    Apache versions are pickier about - please check the <a
    href="misc/compat_notes.html">compatibility notes</a> if you
    have any problems.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>In addition to a number of bug fixes and internal
    performance enhancements, <a
    href="http://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/">Apache 1.2</a> has the
    following specific new user features:</p>

    <ul>
      <!-- change the "name" to an "href" if/when there's such a document -->

      <li><strong><a id="http11.html" name="http11.html">HTTP/1.1
      Compliance</a></strong> [Documentation to be written]<br />
       Aside from the optional proxy module (which operates as
      HTTP/1.0), Apache is conditionally compliant with the
      HTTP/1.1 proposed standard, as approved by the IESG and the
      <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/http/">IETF HTTP
      working group</a>. HTTP/1.1 provides a much-improved
      protocol, and should allow for greater performance and
      efficiency when transferring files. Apache does, however,
      still work great with HTTP/1.0 browsers. We are very close to
      being unconditionally compliant; if you note any deviance
      from the proposed standard, please report it as a bug.</li>

      <li><strong><a href="mod/mod_include.html">eXtended Server
      Side Includes (XSSI)</a></strong><br />
       A new set of server-side include directives allows the user
      to better create WWW pages. This includes number of powerful
      new features, such as the ability to set variables and use
      conditional HTML.</li>

      <li><strong><a href="mod/core.html#files">File-based and
      Regex-enabled Directive Sections</a></strong><br />
       The new <a
      href="mod/core.html#files"><code>&lt;Files&gt;</code></a>
      section allows directives to be enabled based on full
      filename, not just directory and URL. In addition,
      <code>&lt;Files&gt;</code> sections can appear in
      <code>.htaccess</code> files. <code>&lt;Files&gt;</code>,
      along with <a
      href="mod/core.html#directory"><code>&lt;Directory&gt;</code></a>
      and <a
      href="mod/core.html#location"><code>&lt;Location&gt;</code></a>,
      can also now be based on regular expressions, not just simple
      prefix matching.</li>

      <li><strong><a href="mod/mod_browser.html">Browser-based
      Environment Variables</a></strong><br />
       Environment variables can now be set based on the
      <code>User-Agent</code> string of the browser. Combined with
      <a href="mod/mod_include.html">XSSI</a>, this allows you to
      write browser-based conditional HTML documents.</li>

      <li><strong><a href="suexec.html">SetUID CGI
      Execution</a></strong><br />
       Apache now supports the execution of CGI scripts as users
      other than the server user. A number of security checks are
      built in to try and make this as safe as possible.</li>

      <li><strong><a href="mod/mod_rewrite.html">URL Rewriting
      Module</a></strong><br />
       The optional <code>mod_rewrite</code> module is now
      included. This module can provide powerful URL mapping, using
      regular expressions. There's nothing this module can't
      do!</li>

      <li><strong><a href="mod/mod_log_config.html">Enhanced,
      Configurable Logging</a></strong><br />
       The optional <code>mod_log_config</code> included with
      earlier versions of Apache is now standard, and has been
      enhanced to allow logging of much more detail about the
      transaction, and can be used to open <a
      href="multilogs.html">more than one log file</a> at once
      (each of which can have a different log format). If you have
      Apache write any logs to a directory which is writable by
      anyone other than the user that starts the server, see the <a
      href="misc/security_tips.html">security tips</a> document to
      be sure you aren't putting the security of your server at
      risk.</li>

      <li><strong><a href="mod/mod_usertrack.html">User Tracking
      (Cookies) Revisions</a></strong><br />
       The <code>mod_cookies</code> included with previous versions
      of Apache has been renamed <code>mod_usertrack</code>, to
      more accurately reflect its function (some people
      inadvertently thought it enabled cookie support in Apache,
      which is not true - Apache supports the use of cookies
      directly). It is also now possible to disable the generation
      of cookies, even when the cookie module is compiled in. Also,
      an expiry time can be set on the cookies.</li>

      <li><strong><a
      href="mod/core.html#virtualhost">&lt;VirtualHost&gt;
      Enhancements</a></strong><br />
       The &lt;VirtualHost&gt; directive can now take more than one
      IP address or hostname. This lets a single vhost handles
      requests for multiple IPs or hostnames. Also the special
      section &lt;VirtualHost _default_&gt; can be used to handle
      requests normally left for the main server
      configuration.</li>

      <li><strong><a href="mod/mod_cgi.html#cgi_debug">CGI
      Debugging Environment</a></strong><br />
       <code>ScriptLog</code> allows you to now set up a log that
      records all input and output to failed CGI scripts. This
      includes environment variables, input headers, POST data,
      output, and more. This makes CGI scripts much easier to
      debug.</li>

      <li><strong><a href="mod/core.html#rlimit">Resource Limits
      for CGI Scripts</a></strong><br />
       New directives allow the limiting of resources used by CGI
      scripts (<em>e.g.</em>, max CPU time). This is helpful in
      preventing 'runaway' CGI processes.</li>

      <li><strong><a href="mod/mod_alias.html">Redirect Directive
      Can Return Alternate Status</a></strong><br />
       The Redirect directive can return permanent or temporary
      redirects, "Gone" or "See Other" HTTP status. For
      NCSA-compatibility, RedirectTemp and RedirectPermanent are
      also implemented.</li>

      <li><strong><a href="install.html">Simplified
      Compilation</a></strong><br />
       The process of configuring Apache for compilation has been
      simplified.</li>

      <li><strong><a href="mod/core.html#options">Add or Remove
      Options</a></strong><br />
       The <code>Options</code> directive can now add or remove
      options from those currently in force, rather than always
      replacing them.</li>

      <li><strong><a href="invoking.html#help">Command-line
      Help</a></strong><br />
       The <code>-h</code> command-line option now lists all the
      available directives.</li>

      <li><strong><a href="mod/mod_headers.html">Optional Headers
      Module to Set or Remove HTTP Headers</a></strong><br />
       The optional <code>mod_headers</code> module can be used to
      set custom headers in the HTTP response. It can append to
      existing headers, replace them, or remove headers from the

      <li><strong><a href="mod/core.html#ifmodule">Conditional
      Config Directives</a></strong><br />
       A new <code>&lt;IfModule&gt;</code> section allows
      directives to be enabled only if a given module is loaded
      into the server.</li>

      <li><strong><a href="mod/core.html#satisfy">NCSA Satisfy
      authentication directive now implemented</a></strong><br />
       <code>Satisfy</code> allows for more flexible access control
      configurations.</li>

      <li><strong>Better NCSA Compatibility</strong><br />
       Apache directives are now more compatible with NCSA 1.5 to
      make moving between servers easier. In particular, Apache now
      implements the <a
      href="mod/core.html#satisfy"><code>Satisfy</code></a>, <a
      href="mod/core.html#maxkeepaliverequests">MaxKeepAliveRequests</a>,
      <a
      href="mod/mod_alias.html#redirectperm">RedirectPermanent</a>
      and <a
      href="mod/mod_alias.html#redirecttemp">RedirectTemp</a>,
      directives, and the following directives are now
      syntax-compatible with NCSA: <a
      href="mod/mod_auth.html#authuserfile">AuthUserFile</a>, <a
      href="mod/mod_auth.html#authgroupfile">AuthGroupFile</a>, <a
      href="mod/mod_digest.html#authdigestfile">AuthDigestFile</a>,
      <a href="mod/core.html#keepalive">KeepAlive</a> and <a
      href="mod/core.html#keepalivetimeout">KeepAliveTimeout</a>.</li>
