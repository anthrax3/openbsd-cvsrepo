    <h1 align="CENTER">Overview of New Features in Apache 1.3</h1>

    <p>New features with this release, as extensions of the Apache
    functionality. Because the core code has changed so
    significantly, there are certain liberties that earlier
    versions of Apache (and the NCSA daemon) took that recent
    Apache versions are pickier about - please check the <a
    href="misc/compat_notes.html">compatibility notes</a> if you
    have any problems.</p>

    <p>If you're upgrading from Apache 1.2, you may wish to read
    the <a href="upgrading_to_1_3.html">upgrade notes</a>.</p>

    <h2><a id="core" name="core">Core Enhancements:</a></h2>

    <dl>
      <dt><strong><a href="dso.html">Dynamic Shared Object (DSO)
      support</a></strong></dt>

      <dd>Apache modules may now be loaded at runtime; this means
      that modules can be loaded into the server process space only
      when necessary, thus overall memory usage by Apache will be
      significantly reduced. DSO currently is supported on FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD, NetBSD, Linux, Solaris, SunOS, Digital UNIX, IRIX,
      HP/UX, UnixWare, NetWare, AIX, ReliantUnix and generic SVR4
      platforms.</dd>

      <dt><strong><a href="windows.html">Support for Windows
      NT/95</a></strong></dt>

      <dd>Apache now supports the Windows NT and Windows 2000
      operating systems. While Apache may run on Windows 95, 98, or
      ME, these consumer products are never recommended for
      production environments, and their use remains experimental.
      All versions of Apache running on Windows prior to 1.3.15
      should be considered beta quality releases.</dd>

      <dt><strong><a href="cygwin.html">Support for
      Cygwin</a></strong></dt>

      <dd>Apache now supports the Cygwin platform for the Windows
      NT and Windows 2000 operating systems. The Cygwin versions
      should be considered as stable and reliable as the <a
      href="windows.html">Windows</a> native counterpart.</dd>

      <dt><strong><a href="netware.html">Support for NetWare
      5.x</a></strong></dt>

      <dd>Apache now supports NetWare 5.x and above
      operating systems.</dd>

      <dt><strong><a href="sourcereorg.html">Re-organized
      Sources</a></strong></dt>

      <dd>The source files for Apache have been re-organized. The
      main difference for Apache users is that the "Module" lines
      in <code>Configuration</code> have been replaced with
      "AddModule" with a slightly different syntax. For module
      authors there are some changes designed to make it easier for
      users to add their module.</dd>

      <dt><strong>Reliable Piped Logs</strong></dt>

      <dd>On almost all Unix architectures Apache now implements
      "reliable" piped logs in <a
      href="mod/mod_log_config.html">mod_log_config</a>. Where
      reliable means that if the logging child dies for whatever
      reason, Apache will recover and respawn it without having to
      restart the entire server. Furthermore if the logging child
      becomes "stuck" and isn't reading its pipe frequently enough
      Apache will also restart it. This opens up more opportunities
      for log rotation, hit filtering, real-time splitting of
      multiple vhosts into separate logs, and asynchronous DNS
      resolving on the fly.</dd>
    </dl>
    <hr />

    <h2><a id="performance" name="performance">Performance
    Improvements</a></h2>

    <ul>
      <li>IP-based virtual hosts are looked up via hash table.</li>

      <li>&lt;Directory&gt; parsing speedups.</li>

      <li>The critical path for static requests has fewer system
      calls. This generally helps all requests. (45 syscalls for a
      static request in 1.2 versus 22 in 1.3 in a well tuned
      configuration).</li>

      <li><a
      href="mod/mod_proxy.html#proxyreceivebuffersize"><code>ProxyReceiveBufferSize</code></a>
      directive gives <code>mod_proxy</code>'s outgoing connections
      larger network buffers, for increased throughput.</li>

      <li>The low level I/O routines use <code>writev</code> (where
      available) to issue multiple writes with a single system
      call. They also avoid copying memory into buffers as much as
      possible. The result is less CPU time spent on transferring
      large files.</li>

      <li>Static requests are served using <code>mmap</code>, which
      means bytes are only copied from the disk buffer to the
      network buffer directly by the kernel. The program never
      copies bytes around, which reduces CPU time. (Only where
      available/tested.)</li>

      <li>When presented with a load spike, the server quickly
      adapts by spawning children at faster rates.</li>

      <li>The code which dispatches modules was optimized to avoid
      repeatedly skipping over modules that don't implement certain
      phases of the API. (This skipping showed up as 5% of the CPU
      time on profiles of a server with the default module
      mix.)</li>

      <li>Revamp of the Unix scoreboard management code so that
      less time is spent counting children in various states.
      Previously a scan was performed for each hit, now it is
      performed only once per second. This should be noticeable on
      servers running with hundreds of children and high
      loads.</li>

      <li>New serialization choices improve performance on Linux,
      and IRIX.</li>

      <li><code><a
      href="mod/mod_log_config.html">mod_log_config</a></code> can
      be compile-time configured to buffer writes.</li>

      <li>Replaced <code>strncpy()</code> with
      <code>ap_cpystrn()</code>, a routine which doesn't have to
      zero-fill the entire result. This has dramatic effects on
      <code>mod_include</code> speed.</li>

      <li>Additions to the internal "table" API (used for keeping
      lists of key/value string pairs) provide for up to 20%
      performance improvement in many situations.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>See <a href="misc/perf-tuning.html">the new performance
    documentation</a> for more information.</p>

    <h2><a id="config" name="config">Configuration
    Enhancements</a></h2>

    <dl>
      <dt><strong>Unified Server Configuration Files</strong></dt>

      <dd><em>(Apache 1.3.4)</em> The contents of the three server
      configuration files (<samp>httpd.conf</samp>,
      <samp>srm.conf</samp>, and <samp>access.conf</samp>) have
      been merged into a single <samp>httpd.conf</samp> file. The
      <samp>srm.conf</samp> and <samp>access.conf</samp> files are
      now empty except for comments directing the Webmaster to look
      in <samp>httpd.conf</samp>. In addition, the merged
      <samp>httpd.conf</samp> file has been restructured to allow
      directives to appear in a hopefully more intuitive and
      meaningful order.</dd>

      <dt><strong>Continuation Lines in config files</strong></dt>

      <dd>Directive lines in the server configuration files may now
      be split onto multiple lines by using the canonical Unix
      continuation mechanism, namely a '\' as the last non-blank
      character on the line to indicate that the next line should
      be concatenated.</dd>

      <dt><strong>Apache Autoconf-style Interface
      (APACI)</strong></dt>

      <dd>Until Apache 1.3 there was no real out-of-the-box
      batch-capable build and installation procedure for the
      complete Apache package. This is now provided by a top-level
      <code>configure</code> script and a corresponding top-level
      <code>Makefile.tmpl</code> file. The goal is to provide a GNU
      Autoconf-style frontend which is capable to both drive the
      old <code>src/Configure</code> stuff in batch and
      additionally installs the package with a GNU-conforming
      directory layout. Any options from the old configuration
      scheme are available plus a lot of new options for flexibly
      customizing Apache.<br />
       <strong>Note:</strong> The default installation layout has
      changed for Apache 1.3.4. See the files
      <code>README.configure</code> and <code>INSTALL</code> for
      more information.</dd>

      <dt><strong>APache eXtenSion (APXS) support
      tool</strong></dt>

      <dd>Now that Apache provides full support for loading modules
      under runtime from dynamic shared object (DSO) files, a new
      support tool <code>apxs</code> was created which provides
      off-source building, installing and activating of those
      DSO-based modules. It completely hides the platform-dependent
      DSO-build commands from the user and provides an easy way to
      build modules outside the Apache source tree. To achieve this
      APACI installs the Apache C header files together with the
      <code>apxs</code> tool.</dd>

      <dt><a href="install.html#installing"><strong>Default Apache
      directory path changed to
      <code>/usr/local/apache/</code></strong></a><br />
      </dt>

      <dd>The default directory for the Apache ServerRoot changed
      from the NCSA-compatible <code>/usr/local/etc/httpd/</code>
      to <code>/usr/local/apache/</code>. This change covers only
      the default setting (and the documentation); it is of course
      possible to override it using the <a href="invoking.html">-d
      <em>ServerRoot</em> and -f <em>httpd.conf</em></a> switches
      when starting apache.</dd>

      <dt><strong>Improved HTTP/1.1-style Virtual
      Hosts</strong></dt>

      <dd>The new <a
      href="mod/core.html#namevirtualhost"><code>NameVirtualHost</code></a>
      directive is used to list IP address:port pairs on which
      HTTP/1.1-style virtual hosting occurs. This is vhosting based
      on the <code>Host:</code> header from the client. Previously
      this address was implicitly the same as the "main address" of
      the machine, and this caused no end of problems for users,
      and was not powerful enough. Please see the <a
      href="vhosts/">Apache Virtual Host documentation</a> for
      further details on configuration.</dd>

      <dt><strong><code>Include</code> directive</strong></dt>

      <dd>The <a
      href="mod/core.html#include"><code>Include</code></a>
      directive includes other config files immediately at that
      point in parsing.</dd>

      <dt><strong>-S command line option for debugging vhost
      setup</strong></dt>

      <dd>If Apache is invoked with the <code>-S</code> command
      line option it will dump out information regarding how it
      parsed the <code>VirtualHost</code> sections. This is useful
      for folks trying to debug their virtual host
      configuration.</dd>

      <dt><strong>Control of HTTP methods</strong></dt>

      <dd><a href="mod/core.html#limitexcept">&lt;LimitExcept&gt;
      and &lt;/LimitExcept&gt;</a> are used to enclose a group of
      access control directives which will then apply to any HTTP
      access method not listed in the arguments; i.e., it is the
      opposite of a &lt;Limit&gt; section and can be used to
      control both standard and nonstandard/unrecognized
      methods.</dd>
    </dl>
    <hr />

    <h3><a id="mod" name="mod">Module Enhancements</a></h3>

    <dl>
      <dt><a href="mod/mod_negotiation.html"><strong>Improved
      mod_negotiation</strong></a><br />
      </dt>

      <dd>The optional content negotiation (MultiViews) module has
      been completely overhauled for Apache 1.3.4, incorporating
      the latest HTTP/1.1 revisions and the experimental
      Transparent Content Negotion features of RFC 2295 and RFC
      2296.</dd>

      <dt><a href="mod/mod_speling.html"><strong>NEW - Spelling
      correction module</strong></a><br />
      </dt>

      <dd>This optional module corrects frequently occurring
      spelling and capitalization errors in document names
      requested from the server.</dd>

      <dt><a href="mod/mod_setenvif.html"><strong>NEW - Conditional
      setting of environment variables</strong></a><br />
      </dt>

      <dd>The addition of <a
      href="mod/mod_setenvif.html#setenvif"><code>SetEnvIf</code></a>
      and <a
      href="mod/mod_setenvif.html#setenvifnocase"><code>SetEnvIfNoCase</code></a>.
      These allow you to set environment variables for server and
      CGI use based upon attributes of the request.</dd>

      <dt><strong><a href="mod/mod_mime_magic.html">NEW - "Magic"
      MIME-typing</a></strong></dt>

      <dd>The optional <code>mod_mime_magic</code> has been added.
      It uses "magic numbers" and other hints from a file's
      contents to figure out what the contents are. It then uses
      this information to set the file's media type, if it cannot
      be determined by the file's extension.</dd>

      <dt><strong><a href="mod/mod_unique_id.html">NEW - Unique
      Request Identifiers</a></strong></dt>

      <dd><a href="mod/mod_unique_id.html">mod_unique_id</a> can be
      included to generate a unique identifier that distinguishes a
      hit from every other hit. ("Unique" has some restrictions on
      it.) The identifier is available in the environment variable
      <code>UNIQUE_ID</code>.</dd>

      <dt><strong>mod_proxy enhancements:</strong></dt>

      <dd>
        <ul>
          <li>Easier and safer authentication for ftp proxy logins:
          When no ftp user name and/or password is specified in the
          URL, but the destination ftp server requires one, Apache
          now returns a "[401] Authorization Required" status. This
          status code usually makes the client browser pop up an
          "Enter user name and password" dialog, and the request is
          retried with the given user authentification. That is
          slightly more secure than specifying the authentication
          information as part of the request URL, where it could be
          logged in plaintext by older proxy servers.</li>

          <li>The new <samp>AllowCONNECT</samp> directive allows
          configuration of the port numbers to which the proxy
          CONNECT method may connect. That allows proxying to
          https://some.server:8443/ which resulted in an error
          message prior to Apache version 1.3.2.</li>

          <li>The proxy now supports the HTTP/1.1 "Via:" header as
          specified in RFC2068. The new <a
          href="mod/mod_proxy.html#proxyvia"><code>ProxyVia</code></a>
          directive allows switching "Via:" support off or on, or
          suppressing outgoing "Via:" header lines altogether for
          privacy reasons.</li>

          <li>The "Max-Forwards:" TRACE header specified in
          HTTP/1.1 is now supported. With it, you can trace the
          path of a request along a chain of proxies (if they, too,
          support it).</li>

          <li><a
          href="mod/mod_proxy.html#noproxy"><code>NoProxy</code></a>
          and <a
          href="mod/mod_proxy.html#proxydomain"><code>ProxyDomain</code></a>
          directives added to proxy, useful for intranets.</li>

          <li>New <code><a
          href="mod/mod_proxy.html#proxypassreverse">ProxyPassReverse</a></code>
          directive. It lets Apache adjust the URL in the
          <tt>Location</tt> header on HTTP redirect responses.</li>

          <li>Easier navigation in ftp server directory trees.</li>
        </ul>
      </dd>

      <dt><a href="mod/mod_include.html#flowctrl"><strong>Enhanced
      <code>mod_include</code> string
      comparisons</strong></a><br />
      </dt>

      <dd>The string-based server-side include (SSI) flow-control
      directives now include comparison for less-than (&lt;),
      less-than-or-equal (&lt;=), greater-than (&gt;), and
      greater-than-or-equal (&gt;=). Previously comparisons could
      only be made for equality or inequality.</dd>

      <dt><strong>ServerRoot relative auth filenames</strong></dt>

      <dd>Auth filenames for the various authentication modules are
      now treated as relative to the ServerRoot if they are not
      full paths.</dd>

      <dt><a href="mod/mod_autoindex.html"><strong>Enhancements to
      directory indexing:</strong></a></dt>

      <dd>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Code split:</strong>The <code>mod_dir</code>
          module has been split in two, with <a
          href="mod/mod_dir.html">mod_dir</a> handling directory
          index files, and <a
          href="mod/mod_autoindex.html">mod_autoindex</a> creating
          directory listings. Thus allowing folks to remove the
          indexing function from critical servers.</li>

          <li><strong>Sortable:</strong> Clicking on a column title
          will now sort the listing in order by the values in that
          column. This feature can be disabled using the
          <code>SuppressColumnSorting</code> <a
          href="mod/mod_autoindex.html#indexoptions">IndexOptions</a>
          keyword.</li>

          <li><a
          href="mod/mod_autoindex.html#indexoptions:suppresshtmlpreamble">
          <code><strong>SuppressHTMLPreamble</strong></code></a>
          can be used if your README.html file includes its own
          HTML header.</li>

          <li>The <a
          href="mod/mod_autoindex.html#indexoptions"><code><strong>IndexOptions</strong></code></a>
          directive now allows the use of incremental prefixes (+/-
          to add/remove the respective keyword feature, as was
          already possible for the <a
          href="mod/core.html#options">Options</a> directive) to
          its keyword arguments. Multiple IndexOptions directives
          applying to the same directory will now be merged.</li>

          <li><a
          href="mod/mod_autoindex.html#indexoptions:iconheight"><strong>
          <code>IconHeight</code></strong></a> and <a
          href="mod/mod_autoindex.html#indexoptions:iconwidth"><strong>
          <code>IconWidth</code></strong></a> let you set height
          and width attributes to the <code>&lt;IMG&gt;</code> tag
          in directory listings.</li>

          <li>The new <a
          href="mod/mod_autoindex.html#indexoptions:namewidth"><strong>
          <code>NameWidth</code></strong></a> keyword to the <a
          href="mod/mod_autoindex.html#indexoptions">IndexOptions</a>
          directive lets you set the number of columns for <a
          href="mod/mod_autoindex.html#indexoptions:fancyindexing">"fancy"
          directory listings</a>. If set to an '*' asterisk, the
          name width will be adjusted automatically.</li>

          <li>The <a
          href="mod/mod_autoindex.html#fancyindexing"><samp>FancyIndexing</samp></a>
          directive now correctly has the same impact as <a
          href="mod/mod_autoindex.html#indexoptions:fancyindexing"><samp>
          IndexOptions&nbsp;FancyIndexing</samp></a> without
          replacing the effect of any existing
          <samp>IndexOptions</samp> directive.</li>

          <li>Starting with 1.3.15, the server will satisfy

          href="mod/mod_autoindex.html#indexoptions:trackmodified"><samp>TrackModified</samp></a>
          directive. The server will not need to generate the
          listing if the client determines the request has not
          changed, improving performance. Due to its experimental
          nature, this feature is not enabled by default.</li>

      <dt><strong>Less Buffering of CGI Script Output</strong></dt>

      <dd>In previous versions of Apache, the output from CGI
      scripts would be internally buffered by the server, and
      wouldn't be forwarded to the client until either the buffers
      were full or the CGI script completed. As of Apache 1.3, the
      buffer to the client is flushed any time it contains
      something and the server is waiting for more information from
      the script. This allows CGI script to provide partial status
      reports during long processing operations.</dd>

      <dd>The <a

    <h3><a id="api" name="api">API Additions and Changes</a></h3>

    <p>For all those module writers and code hackers:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt><strong><code>child_init</code></strong></dt>

      <dd>A new phase for Apache's API is called once per
      "heavy-weight process," before any requests are handled. This
      allows the module to set up anything that need to be done
      once per processes. For example, connections to
      databases.</dd>

      <dt><strong><code>child_exit</code></strong></dt>

      <dd>A new phase called once per "heavy-weight process," when
      it is terminating. Note that it can't be called in some fatal
      cases (such as segfaults and kill -9). The
      <code>child_init</code> and <code>child_exit</code> functions
      are passed a pool whose lifetime is the same as the lifetime
      of the child (modulo completely fatal events in which Apache
      has no hope of recovering). In contrast, the module
      <code>init</code> function is passed a pool whose lifetime
      ends when the parent exits or restarts.</dd>

      <dt><strong><code>child_terminate</code></strong></dt>

      <dd>Used in the child to indicate the child should exit after
      finishing the current request.</dd>

      <dt><strong><code>register_other_child</code></strong></dt>

      <dd>See <code>http_main.h</code>. This is used in the parent
      to register a child for monitoring. The parent will report
      status to a supplied callback function. This allows modules
      to create their own children which are monitored along with
      the httpd children.</dd>

      <dt><strong><code>piped_log</code></strong></dt>

      <dd>See <code>http_log.h</code>. This API provides the common
      code for implementing piped logs. In particular it implements
      a reliable piped log on architectures supporting it
      (<em>i.e.</em>, Unix at the moment).</dd>

      <dt><strong>scoreboard format changed</strong></dt>

      <dd>The scoreboard format is quite different. It is
      considered a "private" interface in general, so it's only
      mentioned here as an FYI.</dd>

      <dt><strong><code>set_last_modified</code> split into
      three</strong></dt>

      <dd>The old function <code>set_last_modified</code> performed
      multiple jobs including the setting of the
      <code>Last-Modified</code> header, the <code>ETag</code>
      header, and processing conditional requests (such as IMS).
      These functions have been split into three functions:
      <code>set_last_modified</code>, <code>set_etag</code>, and
      <code>meets_conditions</code>. The field <code>mtime</code>
      has been added to <code>request_rec</code> to facilitate
      <code>meets_conditions</code>.</dd>

      <dt><strong>New error logging function:
      <code>ap_log_error</code></strong></dt>

      <dd>All old logging functions are deprecated, we are in the
      process of replacing them with a single function called
      <code>ap_log_error</code>. This is still a work in
      progress.</dd>

      <dt><strong><code>set_file_slot</code> for config
      parsing</strong></dt>

      <dd>The <code>set_file_slot</code> routine provides a
      standard routine that prepends ServerRoot to non-absolute
      paths.</dd>

      <dt><strong><code>post_read_request</code> module
      API</strong></dt>

      <dd>This request phase occurs immediately after reading the
      request (headers), and immediately after creating an internal
      redirect. It is most useful for setting environment variables
      to affect future phases.</dd>

      <dt><strong><code>psocket</code>, and
      <code>popendir</code></strong></dt>

      <dd>The <code>psocket</code> and <code>pclosesocket</code>
      functions allow for race-condition free socket creation with
      resource tracking. Similarly <code>popendir</code> and
      <code>pclosedir</code> protect directory reading.</dd>

      <dt><strong><code>is_initial_req</code></strong></dt>

      <dd>Test if the request is the initial request
      (<em>i.e.</em>, the one coming from the client).</dd>

      <dt><strong><code>kill_only_once</code></strong></dt>

      <dd>An option to <code>ap_spawn_child</code> functions which
      prevents Apache from aggressively trying to kill off the
      child.</dd>

      <dt><strong><code>alloc debugging code</code></strong></dt>

      <dd>Defining <code>ALLOC_DEBUG</code> provides a rudimentary
      memory debugger which can be used on live servers with low
      impact -- it sets all allocated and freed memory bytes to
      0xa5. Defining <code>ALLOC_USE_MALLOC</code> will cause the
      alloc code to use <code>malloc()</code> and
      <code>free()</code> for each object. This is far more
      expensive and should only be used for testing with tools such
      as Electric Fence and Purify. See <code>main/alloc.c</code>
      for more details.</dd>

      <dt><strong><code>ap_cpystrn</code></strong></dt>

      <dd>The new <code>strncpy</code> "lookalike", with slightly
      different semantics is much faster than <code>strncpy</code>
      because it doesn't have to zero-fill the entire buffer.</dd>

      <dt><strong><code>table_addn</code>, <code>table_setn</code>,
      <code>table_mergen</code></strong></dt>

      <dd>These new functions do <strong>not</strong> call
      <code>pstrdup</code> on their arguments. This provides for
      big speedups. There is also some debugging support to ensure
      code uses them properly. See <code>src/CHANGES</code> for
      more information.</dd>

      <dt><strong><code>construct_url</code></strong></dt>

      <dd>The function prototype for this changed from taking a
      <code>server_rec *</code> to taking a <code>request_rec
      *</code>.</dd>

      <dt><strong><code>get_server_name</code>,
      <code>get_server_port</code></strong></dt>

      <dd>These are wrappers which deal with the <a
      href="mod/core.html#usecanonicalname">UseCanonicalName</a>
      directive when retrieving the server name and port for a
      request.</dd>

      <dt><strong>Change to prototype for
      <code>ap_bspawn_child</code> and
      <code>ap_call_exec</code></strong></dt>

      <dd>Added a <code>child_info *</code> to <code>spawn</code>
      function (as passed to <code>ap_bspawn_child</code>) and to
      <code>ap_call_exec</code> to allow children to work correctly
      on Win32. We also cleaned up the nomenclature a bit,
      replacing <code>spawn_child_err</code> with simply
      <code>ap_spawn_child</code> and
      <code>spawn_child_err_buff</code> with simply
      <code>ap_bspawn_child</code>.</dd>

      <dt>
      <strong><code>ap_add_version_component()</code></strong></dt>

      <dd>This API function allows for modules to add their own
      additional server tokens which are printed on the on the
      <code>Server:</code> header line. Previous 1.3beta versions
      had used a <code>SERVER_SUBVERSION</code> compile-time
      <code>#define</code> to perform this function. Whether the
      tokens are actually displayed is controlled by the new
      <code>ServerTokens</code> directive.</dd>

      <dt><strong><a href="ebcdic.html">Port to EBCDIC mainframe
      machine running BS2000/OSD</a></strong></dt>

      <dd>As a premiere, this version of Apache comes with a beta
      version of a port to a mainframe machine which uses the
      EBCDIC character set as its native codeset (It is the SIEMENS
      family of mainframes running the BS2000/OSD operating system
      on a IBM/390 compatible processor. This mainframe OS nowadays
      features a SVR4-like POSIX subsystem).</dd>

      <dt><strong><a
      href="mod/core.html#accessfilename"><code>AccessFileName</code>
      Enhancement</a></strong></dt>

      <dd>The <code>AccessFileName</code> directive can now take
      more than one filename. This lets sites serving pages from
      network file systems and more than one Apache web server,
      configure access based on the server through which shared
      pages are being served.</dd>

      <dt><strong><code>HostnameLookups</code> now defaults to
      "Off"</strong></dt>

      <dd>The <a
      href="mod/core.html#hostnamelookups"><code>HostnameLookups</code></a>
      directive now defaults to "Off". This means that, unless
      explicitly turned on, the server will not resolve IP
      addresses into names. This was done to spare the Internet
      from unnecessary DNS traffic.</dd>

      <dt><strong>Double-Reverse DNS enforced</strong></dt>

      <dd>The <a
      href="mod/core.html#hostnamelookups"><code>HostnameLookups</code></a>
      directive now supports double-reverse DNS. (Known as
      <em>PARANOID</em> in the terminology of tcp_wrappers.) An IP
      address passes a double-reverse DNS test if the forward map
      of the reverse map includes the original IP. Regardless of
      the HostnameLookups setting, <a
      href="mod/mod_access.html">mod_access</a> access lists using
      DNS names <strong>require</strong> all names to pass a
      double-reverse DNS test. (Prior versions of Apache required a
      compile-time switch to enable double-reverse DNS.)</dd>

      <dt><strong>LogLevel and syslog support</strong></dt>

      <dd>Apache now has <a
      href="mod/core.html#loglevel">configurable error logging
      levels</a> and supports <a
      href="mod/core.html#errorlog">error logging via
      syslogd(8)</a>.</dd>

      <dt><strong>Detaching from stdin/out/err</strong></dt>

      <dd>On boot Apache will now detach from stdin, stdout, and
      stderr. It does not detach from stderr until it has
      successfully read the config files. So you will see errors in
      the config file. This should make it easier to start Apache
      via rsh or crontab.</dd>

      <dt><a id="y2k" name="y2k"><strong>Year-2000
      Improvements</strong></a></dt>

      <dd>The default <code>timefmt</code> string used by <a
      href="mod/mod_include.html"><code>mod_include</code></a> has
      been modified to display the year using four digits rather
      than the two-digit format used previously. The <a
      href="mod/mod_autoindex.html"><code>mod_autoindex</code></a>
      module has also been modified to display years using four
      digits in FancyIndexed directory listings.</dd>

      <dt><strong>Common routines Moving to a Separate
      Library</strong></dt>

      <dd>There are a number of functions and routines that have
      been developed for the Apache project that supplement or
      supersede library routines that differ from one operating
      system to another. While most of these are used only by the
      Apache server itself, some are referenced by supporting
      applications (such as <code>htdigest</code>), and these other
      applications would fail to build because the routines were
      built only into the server. These routines are now being
      migrated to a separate subdirectory and library so they can
      be used by other applications than just the server. See the
      <code>src/ap/</code> subdirectory.</dd>

      <dt><strong>New <code><a
      href="mod/core.html#serversignature">ServerSignature</a></code>
      directive</strong></dt>

      <dd>This directive optionally adds a line containing the
      server version and virtual host name to server-generated
      pages (error documents, ftp directory listings, mod_info
      output <em>etc.</em>). This makes it easier for users to tell
      which server produced the error message, especially in a
      proxy chain (often found in intranet environments).</dd>

      <dt><strong>New <code><a
      href="mod/core.html#usecanonicalname">UseCanonicalName</a></code>
      directive</strong></dt>

      <dd>This directive gives control over how Apache creates
      self-referential URLs. Previously Apache would always use the
      <a href="mod/core.html#servername">ServerName</a> and <a
      href="mod/core.html#port">Port</a> directives to construct a
      "canonical" name for the server. With <code>UseCanonicalName
      off</code> Apache will use the hostname and port supplied by
      the client, if available.</dd>

      <dt><strong><code>SERVER_VERSION</code> definition
      abstracted, and server build date added</strong></dt>

      <dd>In earlier versions, the Apache server version was
      available to modules through the <code>#define</code>d value
      for <code>SERVER_VERSION</code>. In order to keep this value
      consistent when modules and the core server are compiled at
      different times, this information is now available through
      the core API routine <code>ap_get_server_version()</code>.
      The use of the <code>SERVER_VERSION</code> symbol is
      deprecated. Also, <code>ap_get_server_built()</code> returns
      a string representing the time the core server was
      linked.</dd>

      the operating system in the server
      identity</strong></a><br />
      </dt>

      <dd>A new directive, <code>ServerTokens</code>, allows the
      Webmaster to change the value of the <code>Server</code>
      response header field which is sent back to clients. The
      <code>ServerTokens</code> directive controls whether the
      server will include a non-specific note in the server
      identity about the type of operating system on which the
      server is running as well as included module information. As
      of Apache 1.3, this additional information is included by
      default.<br />

      password schemes where the password is encrypted using SHA1
      (as opposed to Apache's built in MD5 and/or the OS specific
      crypt(3) function ) passwords prefixed with with
      <code>{SHA1}</code> are taken as Base64 encoded SHA1

significantly, there are certain liberties that earlier versions of
Apache (and the NCSA daemon) took that recent Apache versions are
pickier about - please check the

problems.</P>

<H2><A NAME="core">Core Enhancements:</A></H2>

<DL>
<DT><STRONG><A HREF="dso.html">Dynamic Shared Object (DSO) support</A></STRONG>
<DD>Apache modules may now be loaded at runtime; this means that
    modules can be loaded into the server process space only when necessary,
    thus overall memory usage by Apache will be significantly reduced.  DSO
    currently is supported on FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, Linux, Solaris, SunOS,
    Digital UNIX, IRIX, HP/UX, UnixWare, NetWare, AIX, ReliantUnix and generic
    SVR4 platforms.

<DT><STRONG><A HREF="windows.html">Support for Windows NT/95</A></STRONG>
<DD>Apache now supports the Windows NT and Windows 2000 operating systems.
    While Apache may run on Windows 95, 98, or ME, these consumer products
    are never recommended for production environments, and their use
    remains experimental.  All versions of Apache running on Windows prior 
    to 1.3.15 should be considered beta quality releases.

<DT><STRONG><A HREF="netware.html">Support for NetWare 5.x</A></STRONG>
<DD>Apache now experimentally supports the NetWare 5.x operating systems.

<DT><STRONG><A HREF="sourcereorg.html">Re-organized 
    Sources</A></STRONG>
<DD>The source files for Apache have been re-organized. The main
    difference for Apache users is that the "Module" lines in
    <CODE>Configuration</CODE> have been replaced with "AddModule"
    with a slightly different syntax.  For module authors there are
    some changes designed to make it easier for users to add their
    module.

<DT><STRONG>Reliable Piped Logs</STRONG>
<DD>On almost all Unix architectures Apache now implements "reliable"
    piped logs in <A
    HREF="mod/mod_log_config.html">mod_log_config</A>.  Where reliable
    means that if the logging child dies for whatever reason, Apache
    will recover and respawn it without having to restart the entire
    server.  Furthermore if the logging child becomes "stuck" and
    isn't reading its pipe frequently enough Apache will also restart
    it.  This opens up more opportunities for log rotation, hit
    filtering, real-time splitting of multiple vhosts into separate
    logs, and asynchronous DNS resolving on the fly.

<H2><A NAME="performance">Performance Improvements</A></H2>

<UL>
 <LI>IP-based virtual hosts are looked up via hash table.
 <LI>&lt;Directory&gt; parsing speedups.
 <LI>The critical path for static requests has fewer system calls.
     This generally helps all requests.  (45 syscalls for a static
     request in 1.2 versus 22 in 1.3 in a well tuned
     configuration).
 <LI><A HREF="mod/mod_proxy.html#proxyreceivebuffersize">

 <LI>The low level I/O routines use <CODE>writev</CODE> (where
     available) to issue multiple writes with a single system call.
     They also avoid copying memory into buffers as much as
     possible.  The result is less CPU time spent on transferring
     large files.
 <LI>Static requests are served using <CODE>mmap</CODE>, which
     means bytes are only copied from the disk buffer to the
     network buffer directly by the kernel.  The program never
     copies bytes around, which reduces CPU time.  (Only where
     available/tested.)
 <LI>When presented with a load spike, the server quickly adapts by
     spawning children at faster rates.
 <LI>The code which dispatches modules was optimized to avoid
     repeatedly skipping over modules that don't implement certain
     phases of the API.  (This skipping showed up as 5% of the CPU
     time on profiles of a server with the default module mix.)
 <LI>Revamp of the Unix scoreboard management code so that less
     time is spent counting children in various states.  Previously
     a scan was performed for each hit, now it is performed only
     once per second.  This should be noticeable on servers running
     with hundreds of children and high loads.
 <LI>New serialization choices improve performance on Linux, and
     IRIX.
 <LI><CODE><A
     HREF="mod/mod_log_config.html">mod_log_config</A></CODE> can
     be compile-time configured to buffer writes.
 <LI>Replaced <CODE>strncpy()</CODE> with
     <CODE>ap_cpystrn()</CODE>, a routine which doesn't have to
     zero-fill the entire result.  This has dramatic effects on
     <CODE>mod_include</CODE> speed.
 <LI>Additions to the internal "table" API (used for keeping lists
     of key/value string pairs) provide for up to 20% performance
     improvement in many situations.

<H2><A NAME="config">Configuration Enhancements</A></H2>

<DL>
<DT><STRONG>Unified Server Configuration Files</STRONG></DT>
<DD><EM>(Apache 1.3.4)</EM> The contents of the three
    server configuration files (<SAMP>httpd.conf</SAMP>,
    <SAMP>srm.conf</SAMP>, and <SAMP>access.conf</SAMP>) have
    been merged into a single <SAMP>httpd.conf</SAMP> file.
    The <SAMP>srm.conf</SAMP> and <SAMP>access.conf</SAMP> files
    are now empty except for comments directing the Webmaster
    to look in <SAMP>httpd.conf</SAMP>.  In addition, the
    merged <SAMP>httpd.conf</SAMP> file has been restructured
    to allow directives to appear in a hopefully more
    intuitive and meaningful order.
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Continuation Lines in config files</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Directive lines in the server configuration files may now be
    split onto multiple lines by using the canonical Unix continuation
    mechanism, namely a '\' as the last non-blank character on the
    line to indicate that the next line should be concatenated.
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Apache Autoconf-style Interface (APACI)</STRONG>
<DD>Until Apache 1.3 there was no real out-of-the-box batch-capable
    build and installation procedure for the complete Apache
    package. This is now provided by a top-level
    <CODE>configure</CODE> script and a corresponding top-level
    <CODE>Makefile.tmpl</CODE> file. The goal is to provide a GNU
    Autoconf-style frontend which is capable to both drive the old
    <CODE>src/Configure</CODE> stuff in batch and additionally
    installs the package with a GNU-conforming directory layout.  Any
    options from the old configuration scheme are available plus a lot
    of new options for flexibly customizing Apache.<BR>
    <STRONG>Note:</STRONG> The default installation layout has changed
    for Apache 1.3.4.  See the files <CODE>README.configure</CODE> and
    <CODE>INSTALL</CODE> for more information.

<DT><STRONG>APache eXtenSion (APXS) support tool</STRONG>
<DD>Now that Apache provides full support for loading modules under
    runtime from dynamic shared object (DSO) files, a new support tool
    <CODE>apxs</CODE> was created which provides off-source building,
    installing and activating of those DSO-based modules. It
    completely hides the platform-dependent DSO-build commands from
    the user and provides an easy way to build modules outside the
    Apache source tree. To achieve this APACI installs the Apache C
    header files together with the <CODE>apxs</CODE> tool.
 
<DT><A HREF="install.html#install"><STRONG>Default Apache directory 
    path changed to <CODE>/usr/local/apache/</CODE></STRONG></A><BR>
<DD>The default directory for the Apache ServerRoot changed from the
    NCSA-compatible <CODE>/usr/local/etc/httpd/</CODE> to
    <CODE>/usr/local/apache/</CODE>.  This change covers only the
    default setting (and the documentation); it is of course possible
    to override it using the <A HREF="invoking.html"> -d
    <EM>ServerRoot</EM> and -f <EM>httpd.conf</EM></A> switches when
    starting apache.

<DT><STRONG>Improved HTTP/1.1-style Virtual Hosts</STRONG>
<DD>The new <A
    HREF="mod/core.html#namevirtualhost"><CODE>NameVirtualHost</CODE></A>
    directive is used to list IP address:port pairs on which
    HTTP/1.1-style virtual hosting occurs.  This is vhosting based on
    the <CODE>Host:</CODE> header from the client.  Previously this
    address was implicitly the same as the "main address" of the
    machine, and this caused no end of problems for users, and was not
    powerful enough.  Please see the <A
    HREF="vhosts/">Apache Virtual Host documentation</A> for
    further details on configuration.

<DT><STRONG><CODE>Include</CODE> directive</STRONG>
<DD>The <A HREF="mod/core.html#include" ><CODE>Include</CODE></A>
    directive includes other config files immediately at that point in
    parsing.

<DT><STRONG>-S command line option for debugging vhost setup</STRONG>
<DD>If Apache is invoked with the <CODE>-S</CODE> command line option
    it will dump out information regarding how it parsed the
    <CODE>VirtualHost</CODE> sections.  This is useful for folks
    trying to debug their virtual host configuration.

<DT><STRONG>Control of HTTP methods</STRONG>
<DD><A HREF="mod/core.html#limitexcept">&lt;LimitExcept&gt; and
    &lt;/LimitExcept&gt;</A> are used to enclose a group of access control
    directives which will then apply to any HTTP access method not listed in
    the arguments; i.e., it is the opposite of a &lt;Limit&gt; section and can be
    used to control both standard and nonstandard/unrecognized methods.

<H3><A NAME="mod">Module Enhancements</A></H3>

<DL>
<DT><A HREF="mod/mod_negotiation.html"><STRONG>Improved mod_negotiation
    </STRONG></A><BR>
<DD>The optional content negotiation (MultiViews) module has been completely
    overhauled for Apache 1.3.4, incorporating the latest HTTP/1.1
    revisions and the experimental Transparent Content Negotion features
    of RFC 2295 and RFC 2296.

<DT><A HREF="mod/mod_speling.html"><STRONG>NEW - Spelling correction 
    module</STRONG></A><BR>
<DD>This optional module corrects frequently occurring spelling and
    capitalization errors in document names requested from the server.

<DT><A HREF="mod/mod_setenvif.html"><STRONG>NEW - Conditional setting of 
    environment variables</STRONG></A><BR>
<DD>The addition of
    <A HREF="mod/mod_setenvif.html#SetEnvIf">
    <CODE>SetEnvIf</CODE></A> and
    <A HREF="mod/mod_setenvif.html#SetEnvIfNoCase">
    <CODE>SetEnvIfNoCase</CODE></A>.  These allow you to set
    environment variables for server and CGI use based upon attributes
    of the request.

<DT><STRONG><A HREF="mod/mod_mime_magic.html">NEW - "Magic"
MIME-typing</A></STRONG>
<DD>The optional <CODE>mod_mime_magic</CODE> has been
    added. It uses "magic numbers" and other hints from a file's
    contents to figure out what the contents are. It then uses this
    information to set the file's media type, if it cannot be
    determined by the file's extension.

<DT><STRONG><A HREF="mod/mod_unique_id.html">NEW - Unique Request 
    Identifiers</A></STRONG>
<DD><A HREF="mod/mod_unique_id.html">mod_unique_id</A> can be included
    to generate a unique identifier that distinguishes a hit from
    every other hit.  ("Unique" has some restrictions on it.)  The
    identifier is available in the environment variable
    <CODE>UNIQUE_ID</CODE>.

<DT><STRONG>mod_proxy enhancements:</STRONG>
<dd>
<UL>
<LI>Easier and safer authentication for ftp proxy logins:
    When no ftp user name and/or password is specified in the
    URL, but the destination ftp server requires one, Apache now
    returns a "[401] Authorization Required" status. This status code
    usually makes the client browser pop up an "Enter user name and
    password" dialog, and the request is retried with the given user
    authentification. That is slightly more secure than specifying
    the authentication information as part of the request URL,
    where it could be logged in plaintext by older proxy servers.
<LI>The new <SAMP>AllowCONNECT</SAMP> directive allows configuration
    of the port numbers to which the proxy CONNECT method may connect.
    That allows proxying to https://some.server:8443/ which resulted
    in an error message prior to Apache version 1.3.2.
<LI>The proxy now supports the HTTP/1.1 "Via:" header as specified in
    RFC2068. The new
    <A HREF="mod/mod_proxy.html#proxyvia"><CODE>ProxyVia</CODE></A>
    directive allows switching "Via:" support off or on, or
    suppressing outgoing "Via:" header lines altogether for privacy
    reasons.
<LI>The "Max-Forwards:" TRACE header specified in HTTP/1.1 is now
    supported. With it, you can trace the path of a request along a
    chain of proxies (if they, too, support it).
<LI><A
    HREF="mod/mod_proxy.html#noproxy"><CODE>NoProxy</CODE></A> and <A
    HREF="mod/mod_proxy.html#proxydomain"><CODE>ProxyDomain</CODE></A>
    directives added to proxy, useful for intranets.
<LI>New <CODE><A HREF="mod/mod_proxy.html#proxypassreverse">
    ProxyPassReverse</A></CODE> directive.  It lets Apache adjust the
    URL in the <TT>Location</TT> header on HTTP redirect
    responses. 
<LI>Easier navigation in ftp server directory trees.
</UL>

<DT><A HREF="mod/mod_include.html#flowctrl"><STRONG>Enhanced 
    <CODE>mod_include</CODE> string comparisons</STRONG></A><BR>
<DD>The string-based server-side include (SSI) flow-control directives
    now include comparison for less-than (&lt;), less-than-or-equal
    (&lt;=), greater-than (&gt;), and greater-than-or-equal (&gt;=).
    Previously comparisons could only be made for equality or
    inequality.

<DT><STRONG>ServerRoot relative auth filenames</STRONG>
<DD>Auth filenames for the various authentication modules are now
    treated as relative to the ServerRoot if they are not full paths.

<DT><A HREF="mod/mod_autoindex.html"><STRONG>Enhancements to directory
    indexing:</STRONG></A>

<DD><UL>
    <LI><STRONG>Code split:</STRONG>The <CODE>mod_dir</CODE> module has
        been split in two, with <A
        HREF="mod/mod_dir.html">mod_dir</A> handling directory index
        files, and <A HREF="mod/mod_autoindex.html">mod_autoindex</A>
        creating directory listings.  Thus allowing folks to remove the
        indexing function from critical servers.

    <LI><STRONG>Sortable:</STRONG> Clicking on a column title will now sort 
        the  listing in order by the values in that column.  This feature can
        be disabled using the <CODE>SuppressColumnSorting</CODE> <A
        HREF="mod/mod_autoindex.html#indexoptions">IndexOptions</A>
        keyword.

    <LI><A HREF="mod/mod_autoindex.html#indexoptions:suppresshtmlpreamble">
        <CODE><STRONG>SuppressHTMLPreamble</STRONG></CODE></A> can be used if
        your README.html file includes its own HTML header.

    <LI>The <A HREF="mod/mod_autoindex.html#indexoptions">
        <CODE><STRONG>IndexOptions</STRONG></CODE></A> directive now allows
        the use of incremental prefixes (+/- to add/remove the respective
        keyword feature, as was already possible for the
        <A HREF="mod/core.html#options">Options</A> directive) to its
        keyword arguments. Multiple IndexOptions directives applying
        to the same directory will now be merged.

    <LI><A HREF="mod/mod_autoindex.html#indexoptions:iconheight"
        ><STRONG><CODE>IconHeight</CODE></STRONG></A> and
	<A HREF="mod/mod_autoindex.html#indexoptions:iconwidth"
        ><STRONG><CODE>IconWidth</CODE></STRONG></A>
        let you set height and width attributes to the
        <CODE>&lt;IMG&gt;</CODE> tag in directory listings.

    <LI>The new <A HREF="mod/mod_autoindex.html#indexoptions:namewidth"
        ><STRONG><CODE>NameWidth</CODE></STRONG></A> keyword to the
        <A HREF="mod/mod_autoindex.html#indexoptions">IndexOptions</A>
	directive lets you set the number of columns for
	<A HREF="mod/mod_autoindex.html#indexoptions:fancyindexing">"fancy"
	directory listings</A>. If set to an '*' asterisk, the name width
	will be adjusted automatically.

    <LI>The <A HREF="mod/mod_autoindex.html#fancyindexing"
        ><SAMP>FancyIndexing</SAMP></A> directive now correctly has
        the same impact as 
        <A HREF="mod/mod_autoindex.html#indexoptions:fancyindexing"><SAMP>IndexOptions&nbsp;FancyIndexing</SAMP></A>
	without replacing the effect of any existing <SAMP>IndexOptions</SAMP>
	directive.

    <LI>Starting with 1.3.15, the server will satisfy directory requests
        with the cache controls ETag and LastModified, if IndexOptions
        includes the <A HREF="mod/mod_autoindex.html#trackmodified"
        ><SAMP>TrackModified</SAMP></A> directive.  The server will not
        need to generate the listing if the client determines the request
        has not changed, improving performance.  Due to its experimental
        nature, this feature is not enabled by default.

    </UL>

<DT><STRONG>Less Buffering of CGI Script Output</STRONG>
<DD>In previous versions of Apache, the output from CGI scripts would
    be internally buffered by the server, and wouldn't be forwarded to
    the client until either the buffers were full or the CGI script
    completed.  As of Apache 1.3, the buffer to the client is flushed
    any time it contains something and the server is waiting for more
    information from the script.  This allows CGI script to provide
    partial status reports during long processing operations.


<DT><STRONG><A HREF="mod/mod_alias.html">Regular Expression support for
    <CODE>Alias</CODE> and <CODE>Redirect</CODE></A></STRONG>
<DD>New <A HREF="mod/mod_alias.html#aliasmatch"><CODE>AliasMatch</CODE></A>,
    <A HREF="mod/mod_alias.html#scriptaliasmatch"
    ><CODE>ScriptAliasMatch</CODE></A>, and
    <A HREF="mod/mod_alias.html#redirectmatch"><CODE>RedirectMatch</CODE></A>
    directives allow for the use of regular expression matching.
    Additionally, new
    <A HREF="mod/core.html#directorymatch"
    ><CODE>&lt;DirectoryMatch&gt;</CODE></A>,
    <A HREF="mod/core.html#locationmatch"
    ><CODE>&lt;LocationMatch&gt;</CODE></A>,
    and
    <A HREF="mod/core.html#filesmatch"><CODE>&lt;FilesMatch&gt;</CODE></A>
    sections provide a new syntax for regular expression sectioning.

<DT><STRONG><A
    HREF="mod/mod_info.html#addmoduleinfo"><CODE>AddModuleInfo</CODE></A>
    directive added to <A
    HREF="mod/mod_info.html">mod_info</A></STRONG>
<DD>Allows additional information to be listed along with a specified
    module.

<DT><STRONG>Absence of any <CODE>TransferLog</CODE> disables 
    logging</STRONG>
<DD>If no <A HREF="mod/mod_log_config.html#transferlog"
    ><CODE>TransferLog</CODE></A> directive is given then no log is
    written.  This supports co-existence with other logging modules.

<DT><STRONG>Ability to name logging formats</STRONG>
<DD>The <A
    HREF="mod/mod_log_config.html#logformat"><CODE>LogFormat</CODE></A>
    directive has been enhanced to allow you to give nicknames to
    specific logging formats.  You can then use these nicknames in
    other <CODE>LogFormat</CODE> and <A
    HREF="mod/mod_log_config.html#customlog"
    ><CODE>CustomLog</CODE></A> directives, rather than having to
    spell out the complete log format string each time.

<DT><STRONG>Conditional logging</STRONG>
<DD><A HREF="mod/mod_log_config.html#customlog-conditional">mod_log_config</A>
    now supports logging based upon environment variables.
    mod_log_referer and mod_log_agent are now deprecated.

<DT><STRONG>mod_cern_meta configurable per-directory</STRONG>
<DD><A HREF="mod/mod_cern_meta.html">mod_cern_meta</A> is now
    configurable on a per-directory basis.

<DT><STRONG>New map types for
    <A HREF="mod/mod_rewrite.html#RewriteMap"><CODE>RewriteMap</CODE></A>
    directive</STRONG>
<DD>The new map types `Randomized Plain Text' and `Internal Function'
    were added to the <CODE>RewriteMap</CODE> directive of
    mod_rewrite.  They provide two new features: First, you now can
    randomly choose a sub-value from a value which was looked-up in a
    rewriting map (which is useful when choosing between backend
    servers in a Reverse Proxy situation). Second, you now can
    translate URL parts to fixed (upper or lower) case (which is
    useful when doing mass virtual hosting by the help of
    mod_rewrite).

<DT><STRONG>CIDR and Netmask access control</STRONG>
<DD><A HREF="mod/mod_access.html">mod_access</A> directives now
    support CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) style prefixes, and
    netmasks for greater control over IP access lists.

<P><HR>

<H3><A NAME="api">API Additions and Changes</A></H3>

<P>For all those module writers and code hackers:

<DL>
<DT><STRONG><CODE>child_init</CODE></STRONG>
<DD>A new phase for Apache's API is called once per "heavy-weight process,"
    before any requests are handled. This allows the module to set up
    anything that need to be done once per processes. For example,
    connections to databases.

<DT><STRONG><CODE>child_exit</CODE></STRONG>
<DD>A new phase called once per "heavy-weight process," when it is
    terminating.  Note that it can't be called in some fatal cases (such
    as segfaults and kill -9).  The <CODE>child_init</CODE> and
    <CODE>child_exit</CODE> functions are passed a pool whose lifetime is
    the same as the lifetime of the child (modulo completely fatal
    events in which Apache has no hope of recovering).  In contrast,
    the module <CODE>init</CODE> function is passed a pool whose lifetime
    ends when the parent exits or restarts.

<DT><STRONG><CODE>child_terminate</CODE></STRONG>
<DD>Used in the child to indicate the child should exit after finishing
    the current request.

<DT><STRONG><CODE>register_other_child</CODE></STRONG>
<DD>See <CODE>http_main.h</CODE>.  This is used in the parent to register
    a child for monitoring.  The parent will report status to a supplied
    callback function.  This allows modules to create their own children
    which are monitored along with the httpd children.

<DT><STRONG><CODE>piped_log</CODE></STRONG>
<DD>See <CODE>http_log.h</CODE>.  This API provides the common code for
    implementing piped logs.  In particular it implements a reliable piped
    log on architectures supporting it (<EM>i.e.</EM>, Unix at the moment).

<DT><STRONG>scoreboard format changed</STRONG>
<DD>The scoreboard format is quite different.  It is considered a
    "private" interface in general, so it's only mentioned here as an FYI.

<DT><STRONG><CODE>set_last_modified</CODE> split into three</STRONG>
<DD>The old function <CODE>set_last_modified</CODE> performed multiple
    jobs including the setting of the <CODE>Last-Modified</CODE> header, the
    <CODE>ETag</CODE> header, and processing conditional requests (such as
    IMS).  These functions have been split into three functions:
    <CODE>set_last_modified</CODE>, <CODE>set_etag</CODE>, and
    <CODE>meets_conditions</CODE>.  The field <CODE>mtime</CODE> has been
    added to <CODE>request_rec</CODE> to facilitate
    <CODE>meets_conditions</CODE>.

<DT><STRONG>New error logging function: <CODE>ap_log_error</CODE></STRONG>
<DD>All old logging functions are deprecated, we are in the process of
    replacing them with a single function called <CODE>ap_log_error</CODE>.
    This is still a work in progress.

<DT><STRONG><CODE>set_file_slot</CODE> for config parsing</STRONG>
<DD>The <CODE>set_file_slot</CODE> routine provides a standard routine that
    prepends ServerRoot to non-absolute paths.

<DT><STRONG><CODE>post_read_request</CODE> module API</STRONG>
<DD>This request phase occurs immediately after reading the request (headers),
    and immediately after creating an internal redirect.  It is most useful
    for setting environment variables to affect future phases.

<DT><STRONG><CODE>psocket</CODE>, and <CODE>popendir</CODE></STRONG>
<DD>The <CODE>psocket</CODE> and <CODE>pclosesocket</CODE> functions allow
    for race-condition free socket creation with resource tracking.
    Similarly <CODE>popendir</CODE> and <CODE>pclosedir</CODE> protect
    directory reading.

<DT><STRONG><CODE>is_initial_req</CODE></STRONG>
<DD>Test if the request is the initial request (<EM>i.e.</EM>, the one
    coming from the client).

<DT><STRONG><CODE>kill_only_once</CODE></STRONG>
<DD>An option to <CODE>ap_spawn_child</CODE> functions which prevents Apache
    from aggressively trying to kill off the child.

<DT><STRONG><CODE>alloc debugging code</CODE></STRONG>
<DD>Defining <CODE>ALLOC_DEBUG</CODE> provides a rudimentary memory
    debugger which can be used on live servers with low impact --
    it sets all allocated and freed memory bytes to 0xa5.  Defining
    <CODE>ALLOC_USE_MALLOC</CODE> will cause the alloc code to use
    <CODE>malloc()</CODE> and <CODE>free()</CODE> for each object.  This
    is far more expensive and should only be used for testing with tools
    such as Electric Fence and Purify.  See <CODE>main/alloc.c</CODE>
    for more details.

<DT><STRONG><CODE>ap_cpystrn</CODE></STRONG>
<DD>The new <CODE>strncpy</CODE> "lookalike", with slightly different
    semantics is much faster than <CODE>strncpy</CODE> because it
    doesn't have to zero-fill the entire buffer.

<DT><STRONG><CODE>table_addn</CODE>, <CODE>table_setn</CODE>,
    <CODE>table_mergen</CODE></STRONG>
<DD>These new functions do <STRONG>not</STRONG> call <CODE>pstrdup</CODE>
    on their arguments.  This provides for big speedups.  There is
    also some debugging support to ensure code uses them properly.
    See <CODE>src/CHANGES</CODE> for more information.

<DT><STRONG><CODE>construct_url</CODE></STRONG>
<DD>The function prototype for this changed from taking a
    <CODE>server_rec *</CODE> to taking a <CODE>request_rec *</CODE>.

<DT><STRONG><CODE>get_server_name</CODE>, <CODE>get_server_port</CODE></STRONG>
<DD>These are wrappers which deal with the
    <A HREF="mod/core.html#usecanonicalname">UseCanonicalName</A> directive
    when retrieving the server name and port for a request.

<DT><STRONG>Change to prototype for <CODE>ap_bspawn_child</CODE> and
    <CODE>ap_call_exec</CODE></STRONG>
<DD>Added a <CODE>child_info *</CODE> to <CODE>spawn</CODE> function 
    (as passed to <CODE>ap_bspawn_child</CODE>) and to 
    <CODE>ap_call_exec</CODE> to allow children to work correctly on Win32.
    We also cleaned up the nomenclature a bit, replacing
    <CODE>spawn_child_err</CODE> with simply
    <CODE>ap_spawn_child</CODE> and <CODE>spawn_child_err_buff</CODE>
    with simply <CODE>ap_bspawn_child</CODE>.

<DT><STRONG><CODE>ap_add_version_component()</CODE></STRONG>
<DD>This API function allows for modules to add their own additional
    server tokens which are printed on the on the <CODE>Server:</CODE>
    header line. Previous 1.3beta versions had used a
    <CODE>SERVER_SUBVERSION</CODE> compile-time <CODE>#define</CODE>
    to perform this function. Whether the tokens are actually displayed
    is controlled by the new <CODE>ServerTokens</CODE> directive.

<H3><A NAME="misc">Miscellaneous Enhancements</A></H3>

<DL>
<DT><STRONG><A HREF="ebcdic.html">Port to EBCDIC mainframe machine
    running BS2000/OSD</A></STRONG>
<DD>As a premiere, this version of Apache comes with a beta version of
    a port to a mainframe machine which uses the EBCDIC character set
    as its native codeset (It is the SIEMENS family of mainframes
    running the BS2000/OSD operating system on a IBM/390
    compatible processor. This mainframe OS nowadays features a
    SVR4-like POSIX subsystem).

<DT><STRONG><A HREF="mod/core.html#accessfilename"><CODE>AccessFileName</CODE>
    Enhancement</A></STRONG>
<DD>The <CODE>AccessFileName</CODE> directive can now take more than
    one filename. This lets sites serving pages from network file
    systems and more than one Apache web server, configure access
    based on the server through which shared pages are being served.

<DT><STRONG><CODE>HostNameLookups</CODE> now defaults to "Off"</STRONG>
<DD>The <A
    HREF="mod/core.html#hostnamelookups"><CODE>HostNameLookups</CODE></A>
    directive now defaults to "Off". This means that, unless explicitly
    turned on, the server will not resolve IP addresses into names. This
    was done to spare the Internet from unnecessary DNS traffic.

<DT><STRONG>Double-Reverse DNS enforced</STRONG>
<DD>The <A
    HREF="mod/core.html#hostnamelookups"><CODE>HostnameLookups</CODE></A>
    directive now supports double-reverse DNS.  (Known as
    <EM>PARANOID</EM> in the terminology of tcp_wrappers.)  An IP
    address passes a double-reverse DNS test if the forward map of the
    reverse map includes the original IP.  Regardless of the
    HostnameLookups setting, <A
    HREF="mod/mod_access.html">mod_access</A> access lists using DNS
    names <STRONG>require</STRONG> all names to pass a double-reverse
    DNS test.  (Prior versions of Apache required a compile-time
    switch to enable double-reverse DNS.)

<DT><STRONG>LogLevel and syslog support</STRONG>
<DD>Apache now has <A HREF="mod/core.html#loglevel">configurable error
    logging levels</A> and supports <A
    HREF="mod/core.html#errorlog">error logging via syslogd(8)</A>.
    
<DT><STRONG>Detaching from stdin/out/err</STRONG>
<DD>On boot Apache will now detach from stdin, stdout, and stderr.  It
    does not detach from stderr until it has successfully read the
    config files.  So you will see errors in the config file.  This
    should make it easier to start Apache via rsh or crontab.

<DT><A NAME="y2k"><STRONG>Year-2000 Improvements</STRONG></A>
<DD>The default <CODE>timefmt</CODE> string used by <A
    HREF="mod/mod_include.html"><CODE>mod_include</CODE></A> has been
    modified to display the year using four digits rather than the
    two-digit format used previously.  The <A
    HREF="mod/mod_autoindex.html"><CODE>mod_autoindex</CODE></A>
    module has also been modified to display years using four digits
    in FancyIndexed directory listings.

<DT><STRONG>Common routines Moving to a Separate Library</STRONG>
<DD>There are a number of functions and routines that have been
    developed for the Apache project that supplement or supersede
    library routines that differ from one operating system to another.
    While most of these are used only by the Apache server itself,
    some are referenced by supporting applications (such as
    <CODE>htdigest</CODE>), and these other applications would fail to
    build because the routines were built only into the server.  These
    routines are now being migrated to a separate subdirectory and
    library so they can be used by other applications than just the
    server.  See the <CODE>src/ap/</CODE> subdirectory.

<DT><STRONG>New <CODE><A HREF="mod/core.html#serversignature">
    ServerSignature</A></CODE> directive</STRONG>
<DD>This directive optionally adds a line containing the server
    version and virtual host name to server-generated pages (error
    documents, ftp directory listings, mod_info output <EM>etc.</EM>). This
    makes it easier for users to tell which server produced the error
    message, especially in a proxy chain (often found in intranet
    environments).

<DT><STRONG>New <CODE><A HREF="mod/core.html#usecanonicalname">
    UseCanonicalName</A></CODE> directive</STRONG>
<DD>This directive gives control over how Apache creates
    self-referential URLs.  Previously Apache would always use the <A
    HREF="mod/core.html#servername"> ServerName</A> and <A
    HREF="mod/core.html#port">Port</A> directives to construct a
    "canonical" name for the server.  With <CODE>UseCanonicalName
    off</CODE> Apache will use the hostname and port supplied by the
    client, if available.

<DT><STRONG><CODE>SERVER_VERSION</CODE> definition abstracted, and server
    build date added</STRONG> 
<DD>In earlier versions, the Apache server version was available to
    modules through the <CODE>#define</CODE>d value for
    <CODE>SERVER_VERSION</CODE>.  In order to keep this value
    consistent when modules and the core server are compiled at
    different times, this information is now available through the
    core API routine <CODE>ap_get_server_version()</CODE>.  The use of
    the <CODE>SERVER_VERSION</CODE> symbol is deprecated.  Also,
    <CODE>ap_get_server_built()</CODE> returns a string representing
    the time the core server was linked.
 
<DT><A HREF="mod/core.html#servertokens"><STRONG>Including the operating 
    system in the server identity</STRONG></A><BR>
<DD>A new directive, <CODE>ServerTokens</CODE>, allows the Webmaster
    to change the value of the <CODE>Server</CODE> response header
    field which is sent back to clients.  The <CODE>ServerTokens</CODE>
    directive controls whether the server will include a non-specific
    note in the server identity about the type of operating system on
    which the server is running as well as included module information.
    As of Apache 1.3, this additional information is included by default.

<br><br>

<DT><STRONG>Support for Netscape style SHA1 encrypted passwords</STRONG><BR>
<DD>To facilitate migration or integration of BasicAuth password
    schemes where the password is encrypted using SHA1 (as opposed
    to Apache's built in MD5 and/or the OS specific crypt(3) function
    ) passwords prefixed with with <CODE>{SHA1}</CODE> are taken
    as Base64 encoded SHA1 passwords. More information and
    some utilities to convert Netscape ldap/ldif entries can be
    found in support/SHA1.

    <h1 align="CENTER">Overview of New Features in Apache 1.3</h1>

    <p>New features with this release, as extensions of the Apache
    functionality. Because the core code has changed so
    significantly, there are certain liberties that earlier
    versions of Apache (and the NCSA daemon) took that recent
    Apache versions are pickier about - please check the <a
    href="misc/compat_notes.html">compatibility notes</a> if you
    have any problems.</p>

    <p>If you're upgrading from Apache 1.2, you may wish to read
    the <a href="upgrading_to_1_3.html">upgrade notes</a>.</p>

    <h2><a id="core" name="core">Core Enhancements:</a></h2>

    <dl>
      <dt><strong><a href="dso.html">Dynamic Shared Object (DSO)
      support</a></strong></dt>

      <dd>Apache modules may now be loaded at runtime; this means
      that modules can be loaded into the server process space only
      when necessary, thus overall memory usage by Apache will be
      significantly reduced. DSO currently is supported on FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD, NetBSD, Linux, Solaris, SunOS, Digital UNIX, IRIX,
      HP/UX, UnixWare, NetWare, AIX, ReliantUnix and generic SVR4
      platforms.</dd>

      <dt><strong><a href="windows.html">Support for Windows
      NT/95</a></strong></dt>

      <dd>Apache now supports the Windows NT and Windows 2000
      operating systems. While Apache may run on Windows 95, 98, or
      ME, these consumer products are never recommended for
      production environments, and their use remains experimental.
      All versions of Apache running on Windows prior to 1.3.15
      should be considered beta quality releases.</dd>

      <dt><strong><a href="cygwin.html">Support for
      Cygwin</a></strong></dt>

      <dd>Apache now supports the Cygwin platform for the Windows
      NT and Windows 2000 operating systems. The Cygwin versions
      should be considered as stable and reliable as the <a
      href="windows.html">Windows</a> native counterpart.</dd>

      <dt><strong><a href="netware.html">Support for NetWare
      5.x</a></strong></dt>

      <dd>Apache now supports NetWare 5.x and above
      operating systems.</dd>

      <dt><strong><a href="sourcereorg.html">Re-organized
      Sources</a></strong></dt>

      <dd>The source files for Apache have been re-organized. The
      main difference for Apache users is that the "Module" lines
      in <code>Configuration</code> have been replaced with
      "AddModule" with a slightly different syntax. For module
      authors there are some changes designed to make it easier for
      users to add their module.</dd>

      <dt><strong>Reliable Piped Logs</strong></dt>

      <dd>On almost all Unix architectures Apache now implements
      "reliable" piped logs in <a
      href="mod/mod_log_config.html">mod_log_config</a>. Where
      reliable means that if the logging child dies for whatever
      reason, Apache will recover and respawn it without having to
      restart the entire server. Furthermore if the logging child
      becomes "stuck" and isn't reading its pipe frequently enough
      Apache will also restart it. This opens up more opportunities
      for log rotation, hit filtering, real-time splitting of
      multiple vhosts into separate logs, and asynchronous DNS
      resolving on the fly.</dd>
    </dl>
    <hr />

    <h2><a id="performance" name="performance">Performance
    Improvements</a></h2>

    <ul>
      <li>IP-based virtual hosts are looked up via hash table.</li>

      <li>&lt;Directory&gt; parsing speedups.</li>

      <li>The critical path for static requests has fewer system
      calls. This generally helps all requests. (45 syscalls for a
      static request in 1.2 versus 22 in 1.3 in a well tuned
      configuration).</li>

      <li><a
      href="mod/mod_proxy.html#proxyreceivebuffersize"><code>ProxyReceiveBufferSize</code></a>
      directive gives <code>mod_proxy</code>'s outgoing connections
      larger network buffers, for increased throughput.</li>

      <li>The low level I/O routines use <code>writev</code> (where
      available) to issue multiple writes with a single system
      call. They also avoid copying memory into buffers as much as
      possible. The result is less CPU time spent on transferring
      large files.</li>

      <li>Static requests are served using <code>mmap</code>, which
      means bytes are only copied from the disk buffer to the
      network buffer directly by the kernel. The program never
      copies bytes around, which reduces CPU time. (Only where
      available/tested.)</li>

      <li>When presented with a load spike, the server quickly
      adapts by spawning children at faster rates.</li>

      <li>The code which dispatches modules was optimized to avoid
      repeatedly skipping over modules that don't implement certain
      phases of the API. (This skipping showed up as 5% of the CPU
      time on profiles of a server with the default module
      mix.)</li>

      <li>Revamp of the Unix scoreboard management code so that
      less time is spent counting children in various states.
      Previously a scan was performed for each hit, now it is
      performed only once per second. This should be noticeable on
      servers running with hundreds of children and high
      loads.</li>

      <li>New serialization choices improve performance on Linux,
      and IRIX.</li>

      <li><code><a
      href="mod/mod_log_config.html">mod_log_config</a></code> can
      be compile-time configured to buffer writes.</li>

      <li>Replaced <code>strncpy()</code> with
      <code>ap_cpystrn()</code>, a routine which doesn't have to
      zero-fill the entire result. This has dramatic effects on
      <code>mod_include</code> speed.</li>

      <li>Additions to the internal "table" API (used for keeping
      lists of key/value string pairs) provide for up to 20%
      performance improvement in many situations.</li>
    </ul>

    documentation</a> for more information.</p>

    <h2><a id="config" name="config">Configuration
    Enhancements</a></h2>

    <dl>
      <dt><strong>Unified Server Configuration Files</strong></dt>

      <dd><em>(Apache 1.3.4)</em> The contents of the three server
      configuration files (<samp>httpd.conf</samp>,
      <samp>srm.conf</samp>, and <samp>access.conf</samp>) have
      been merged into a single <samp>httpd.conf</samp> file. The
      <samp>srm.conf</samp> and <samp>access.conf</samp> files are
      now empty except for comments directing the Webmaster to look
      in <samp>httpd.conf</samp>. In addition, the merged
      <samp>httpd.conf</samp> file has been restructured to allow
      directives to appear in a hopefully more intuitive and
      meaningful order.</dd>

      <dt><strong>Continuation Lines in config files</strong></dt>

      <dd>Directive lines in the server configuration files may now
      be split onto multiple lines by using the canonical Unix
      continuation mechanism, namely a '\' as the last non-blank
      character on the line to indicate that the next line should
      be concatenated.</dd>

      <dt><strong>Apache Autoconf-style Interface
      (APACI)</strong></dt>

      <dd>Until Apache 1.3 there was no real out-of-the-box
      batch-capable build and installation procedure for the
      complete Apache package. This is now provided by a top-level
      <code>configure</code> script and a corresponding top-level
      <code>Makefile.tmpl</code> file. The goal is to provide a GNU
      Autoconf-style frontend which is capable to both drive the
      old <code>src/Configure</code> stuff in batch and
      additionally installs the package with a GNU-conforming
      directory layout. Any options from the old configuration
      scheme are available plus a lot of new options for flexibly
      customizing Apache.<br />
       <strong>Note:</strong> The default installation layout has
      changed for Apache 1.3.4. See the files
      <code>README.configure</code> and <code>INSTALL</code> for
      more information.</dd>

      <dt><strong>APache eXtenSion (APXS) support
      tool</strong></dt>

      <dd>Now that Apache provides full support for loading modules
      under runtime from dynamic shared object (DSO) files, a new
      support tool <code>apxs</code> was created which provides
      off-source building, installing and activating of those
      DSO-based modules. It completely hides the platform-dependent
      DSO-build commands from the user and provides an easy way to
      build modules outside the Apache source tree. To achieve this
      APACI installs the Apache C header files together with the
      <code>apxs</code> tool.</dd>

      <dt><a href="install.html#install"><strong>Default Apache
      directory path changed to
      <code>/usr/local/apache/</code></strong></a><br />
      </dt>

      <dd>The default directory for the Apache ServerRoot changed
      from the NCSA-compatible <code>/usr/local/etc/httpd/</code>
      to <code>/usr/local/apache/</code>. This change covers only
      the default setting (and the documentation); it is of course
      possible to override it using the <a href="invoking.html">-d
      <em>ServerRoot</em> and -f <em>httpd.conf</em></a> switches
      when starting apache.</dd>

      <dt><strong>Improved HTTP/1.1-style Virtual
      Hosts</strong></dt>

      <dd>The new <a
      href="mod/core.html#namevirtualhost"><code>NameVirtualHost</code></a>
      directive is used to list IP address:port pairs on which
      HTTP/1.1-style virtual hosting occurs. This is vhosting based
      on the <code>Host:</code> header from the client. Previously
      this address was implicitly the same as the "main address" of
      the machine, and this caused no end of problems for users,
      and was not powerful enough. Please see the <a
      href="vhosts/">Apache Virtual Host documentation</a> for
      further details on configuration.</dd>

      <dt><strong><code>Include</code> directive</strong></dt>

      <dd>The <a
      href="mod/core.html#include"><code>Include</code></a>
      directive includes other config files immediately at that
      point in parsing.</dd>

      <dt><strong>-S command line option for debugging vhost
      setup</strong></dt>

      <dd>If Apache is invoked with the <code>-S</code> command
      line option it will dump out information regarding how it
      parsed the <code>VirtualHost</code> sections. This is useful
      for folks trying to debug their virtual host
      configuration.</dd>

      <dt><strong>Control of HTTP methods</strong></dt>

      <dd><a href="mod/core.html#limitexcept">&lt;LimitExcept&gt;
      and &lt;/LimitExcept&gt;</a> are used to enclose a group of
      access control directives which will then apply to any HTTP
      access method not listed in the arguments; i.e., it is the
      opposite of a &lt;Limit&gt; section and can be used to
      control both standard and nonstandard/unrecognized
      methods.</dd>
    </dl>
    <hr />

    <h3><a id="mod" name="mod">Module Enhancements</a></h3>

    <dl>
      <dt><a href="mod/mod_negotiation.html"><strong>Improved
      mod_negotiation</strong></a><br />
      </dt>

      <dd>The optional content negotiation (MultiViews) module has
      been completely overhauled for Apache 1.3.4, incorporating
      the latest HTTP/1.1 revisions and the experimental
      Transparent Content Negotion features of RFC 2295 and RFC
      2296.</dd>

      <dt><a href="mod/mod_speling.html"><strong>NEW - Spelling
      correction module</strong></a><br />
      </dt>

      <dd>This optional module corrects frequently occurring
      spelling and capitalization errors in document names
      requested from the server.</dd>

      <dt><a href="mod/mod_setenvif.html"><strong>NEW - Conditional
      setting of environment variables</strong></a><br />
      </dt>

      <dd>The addition of <a

      and <a
      href="mod/mod_setenvif.html#SetEnvIfNoCase"><code>SetEnvIfNoCase</code></a>.
      These allow you to set environment variables for server and
      CGI use based upon attributes of the request.</dd>

      <dt><strong><a href="mod/mod_mime_magic.html">NEW - "Magic"
      MIME-typing</a></strong></dt>

      <dd>The optional <code>mod_mime_magic</code> has been added.
      It uses "magic numbers" and other hints from a file's
      contents to figure out what the contents are. It then uses
      this information to set the file's media type, if it cannot
      be determined by the file's extension.</dd>

      <dt><strong><a href="mod/mod_unique_id.html">NEW - Unique
      Request Identifiers</a></strong></dt>

      <dd><a href="mod/mod_unique_id.html">mod_unique_id</a> can be
      included to generate a unique identifier that distinguishes a
      hit from every other hit. ("Unique" has some restrictions on
      it.) The identifier is available in the environment variable
      <code>UNIQUE_ID</code>.</dd>

      <dt><strong>mod_proxy enhancements:</strong></dt>

      <dd>
        <ul>
          <li>Easier and safer authentication for ftp proxy logins:
          When no ftp user name and/or password is specified in the
          URL, but the destination ftp server requires one, Apache
          now returns a "[401] Authorization Required" status. This
          status code usually makes the client browser pop up an
          "Enter user name and password" dialog, and the request is
          retried with the given user authentification. That is
          slightly more secure than specifying the authentication
          information as part of the request URL, where it could be
          logged in plaintext by older proxy servers.</li>

          <li>The new <samp>AllowCONNECT</samp> directive allows
          configuration of the port numbers to which the proxy
          CONNECT method may connect. That allows proxying to
          https://some.server:8443/ which resulted in an error
          message prior to Apache version 1.3.2.</li>

          <li>The proxy now supports the HTTP/1.1 "Via:" header as
          specified in RFC2068. The new <a
          href="mod/mod_proxy.html#proxyvia"><code>ProxyVia</code></a>
          directive allows switching "Via:" support off or on, or
          suppressing outgoing "Via:" header lines altogether for
          privacy reasons.</li>

          <li>The "Max-Forwards:" TRACE header specified in
          HTTP/1.1 is now supported. With it, you can trace the
          path of a request along a chain of proxies (if they, too,
          support it).</li>

          <li><a
          href="mod/mod_proxy.html#noproxy"><code>NoProxy</code></a>
          and <a
          href="mod/mod_proxy.html#proxydomain"><code>ProxyDomain</code></a>
          directives added to proxy, useful for intranets.</li>

          <li>New <code><a
          href="mod/mod_proxy.html#proxypassreverse">ProxyPassReverse</a></code>
          directive. It lets Apache adjust the URL in the
          <tt>Location</tt> header on HTTP redirect responses.</li>

          <li>Easier navigation in ftp server directory trees.</li>
        </ul>
      </dd>

      <dt><a href="mod/mod_include.html#flowctrl"><strong>Enhanced
      <code>mod_include</code> string
      comparisons</strong></a><br />
      </dt>

      <dd>The string-based server-side include (SSI) flow-control
      directives now include comparison for less-than (&lt;),
      less-than-or-equal (&lt;=), greater-than (&gt;), and
      greater-than-or-equal (&gt;=). Previously comparisons could
      only be made for equality or inequality.</dd>

      <dt><strong>ServerRoot relative auth filenames</strong></dt>

      <dd>Auth filenames for the various authentication modules are
      now treated as relative to the ServerRoot if they are not
      full paths.</dd>

      <dt><a href="mod/mod_autoindex.html"><strong>Enhancements to
      directory indexing:</strong></a></dt>

      <dd>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Code split:</strong>The <code>mod_dir</code>
          module has been split in two, with <a
          href="mod/mod_dir.html">mod_dir</a> handling directory
          index files, and <a
          href="mod/mod_autoindex.html">mod_autoindex</a> creating
          directory listings. Thus allowing folks to remove the
          indexing function from critical servers.</li>

          <li><strong>Sortable:</strong> Clicking on a column title
          will now sort the listing in order by the values in that

          href="mod/mod_autoindex.html#indexoptions:fancyindexing">"fancy"
          directory listings</a>. If set to an '*' asterisk, the

          directory requests with the cache controls ETag and

      <dt><strong>Less Buffering of CGI Script Output</strong></dt>

      <dd>In previous versions of Apache, the output from CGI
      scripts would be internally buffered by the server, and
      wouldn't be forwarded to the client until either the buffers
      were full or the CGI script completed. As of Apache 1.3, the
      buffer to the client is flushed any time it contains
      something and the server is waiting for more information from
      the script. This allows CGI script to provide partial status
      reports during long processing operations.</dd>

    <h3><a id="api" name="api">API Additions and Changes</a></h3>

    <p>For all those module writers and code hackers:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt><strong><code>child_init</code></strong></dt>

      <dd>A new phase for Apache's API is called once per
      "heavy-weight process," before any requests are handled. This
      allows the module to set up anything that need to be done
      once per processes. For example, connections to
      databases.</dd>

      <dt><strong><code>child_exit</code></strong></dt>

      <dd>A new phase called once per "heavy-weight process," when
      it is terminating. Note that it can't be called in some fatal
      cases (such as segfaults and kill -9). The
      <code>child_init</code> and <code>child_exit</code> functions
      are passed a pool whose lifetime is the same as the lifetime
      of the child (modulo completely fatal events in which Apache
      has no hope of recovering). In contrast, the module
      <code>init</code> function is passed a pool whose lifetime
      ends when the parent exits or restarts.</dd>

      <dt><strong><code>child_terminate</code></strong></dt>

      <dd>Used in the child to indicate the child should exit after
      finishing the current request.</dd>

      <dt><strong><code>register_other_child</code></strong></dt>

      <dd>See <code>http_main.h</code>. This is used in the parent
      to register a child for monitoring. The parent will report
      status to a supplied callback function. This allows modules
      to create their own children which are monitored along with
      the httpd children.</dd>

      <dt><strong><code>piped_log</code></strong></dt>

      <dd>See <code>http_log.h</code>. This API provides the common
      code for implementing piped logs. In particular it implements
      a reliable piped log on architectures supporting it
      (<em>i.e.</em>, Unix at the moment).</dd>

      <dt><strong>scoreboard format changed</strong></dt>

      <dd>The scoreboard format is quite different. It is
      considered a "private" interface in general, so it's only
      mentioned here as an FYI.</dd>

      <dt><strong><code>set_last_modified</code> split into
      three</strong></dt>

      <dd>The old function <code>set_last_modified</code> performed
      multiple jobs including the setting of the
      <code>Last-Modified</code> header, the <code>ETag</code>
      header, and processing conditional requests (such as IMS).
      These functions have been split into three functions:
      <code>set_last_modified</code>, <code>set_etag</code>, and
      <code>meets_conditions</code>. The field <code>mtime</code>
      has been added to <code>request_rec</code> to facilitate
      <code>meets_conditions</code>.</dd>

      <dt><strong>New error logging function:
      <code>ap_log_error</code></strong></dt>

      <dd>All old logging functions are deprecated, we are in the
      process of replacing them with a single function called
      <code>ap_log_error</code>. This is still a work in
      progress.</dd>

      <dt><strong><code>set_file_slot</code> for config
      parsing</strong></dt>

      <dd>The <code>set_file_slot</code> routine provides a
      standard routine that prepends ServerRoot to non-absolute
      paths.</dd>

      <dt><strong><code>post_read_request</code> module
      API</strong></dt>

      <dd>This request phase occurs immediately after reading the
      request (headers), and immediately after creating an internal
      redirect. It is most useful for setting environment variables
      to affect future phases.</dd>

      <dt><strong><code>psocket</code>, and
      <code>popendir</code></strong></dt>

      <dd>The <code>psocket</code> and <code>pclosesocket</code>
      functions allow for race-condition free socket creation with
      resource tracking. Similarly <code>popendir</code> and
      <code>pclosedir</code> protect directory reading.</dd>

      <dt><strong><code>is_initial_req</code></strong></dt>

      <dd>Test if the request is the initial request
      (<em>i.e.</em>, the one coming from the client).</dd>

      <dt><strong><code>kill_only_once</code></strong></dt>

      <dd>An option to <code>ap_spawn_child</code> functions which
      prevents Apache from aggressively trying to kill off the
      child.</dd>

      <dt><strong><code>alloc debugging code</code></strong></dt>

      <dd>Defining <code>ALLOC_DEBUG</code> provides a rudimentary
      memory debugger which can be used on live servers with low
      impact -- it sets all allocated and freed memory bytes to
      0xa5. Defining <code>ALLOC_USE_MALLOC</code> will cause the
      alloc code to use <code>malloc()</code> and
      <code>free()</code> for each object. This is far more
      expensive and should only be used for testing with tools such
      as Electric Fence and Purify. See <code>main/alloc.c</code>
      for more details.</dd>

      <dt><strong><code>ap_cpystrn</code></strong></dt>

      <dd>The new <code>strncpy</code> "lookalike", with slightly
      different semantics is much faster than <code>strncpy</code>
      because it doesn't have to zero-fill the entire buffer.</dd>

      <dt><strong><code>table_addn</code>, <code>table_setn</code>,
      <code>table_mergen</code></strong></dt>

      <dd>These new functions do <strong>not</strong> call
      <code>pstrdup</code> on their arguments. This provides for
      big speedups. There is also some debugging support to ensure
      code uses them properly. See <code>src/CHANGES</code> for
      more information.</dd>

      <dt><strong><code>construct_url</code></strong></dt>

      <dd>The function prototype for this changed from taking a
      <code>server_rec *</code> to taking a <code>request_rec
      *</code>.</dd>

      <dt><strong><code>get_server_name</code>,
      <code>get_server_port</code></strong></dt>

      <dd>These are wrappers which deal with the <a
      href="mod/core.html#usecanonicalname">UseCanonicalName</a>
      directive when retrieving the server name and port for a
      request.</dd>

      <dt><strong>Change to prototype for
      <code>ap_bspawn_child</code> and
      <code>ap_call_exec</code></strong></dt>

      <dd>Added a <code>child_info *</code> to <code>spawn</code>
      function (as passed to <code>ap_bspawn_child</code>) and to
      <code>ap_call_exec</code> to allow children to work correctly
      on Win32. We also cleaned up the nomenclature a bit,
      replacing <code>spawn_child_err</code> with simply
      <code>ap_spawn_child</code> and
      <code>spawn_child_err_buff</code> with simply
      <code>ap_bspawn_child</code>.</dd>

      <dt>
      <strong><code>ap_add_version_component()</code></strong></dt>

      <dd>This API function allows for modules to add their own
      additional server tokens which are printed on the on the
      <code>Server:</code> header line. Previous 1.3beta versions
      had used a <code>SERVER_SUBVERSION</code> compile-time
      <code>#define</code> to perform this function. Whether the
      tokens are actually displayed is controlled by the new
      <code>ServerTokens</code> directive.</dd>

    <dl>
      <dt><strong><a href="ebcdic.html">Port to EBCDIC mainframe
      machine running BS2000/OSD</a></strong></dt>

      <dd>As a premiere, this version of Apache comes with a beta
      version of a port to a mainframe machine which uses the
      EBCDIC character set as its native codeset (It is the SIEMENS
      family of mainframes running the BS2000/OSD operating system
      on a IBM/390 compatible processor. This mainframe OS nowadays
      features a SVR4-like POSIX subsystem).</dd>

      <dt><strong><a
      href="mod/core.html#accessfilename"><code>AccessFileName</code>
      Enhancement</a></strong></dt>

      <dd>The <code>AccessFileName</code> directive can now take
      more than one filename. This lets sites serving pages from
      network file systems and more than one Apache web server,
      configure access based on the server through which shared
      pages are being served.</dd>

      <dt><strong><code>HostnameLookups</code> now defaults to
      "Off"</strong></dt>

      <dd>The <a
      href="mod/core.html#hostnamelookups"><code>HostnameLookups</code></a>
      directive now defaults to "Off". This means that, unless
      explicitly turned on, the server will not resolve IP
      addresses into names. This was done to spare the Internet
      from unnecessary DNS traffic.</dd>

      <dt><strong>Double-Reverse DNS enforced</strong></dt>

      <dd>The <a
      href="mod/core.html#hostnamelookups"><code>HostnameLookups</code></a>
      directive now supports double-reverse DNS. (Known as
      <em>PARANOID</em> in the terminology of tcp_wrappers.) An IP
      address passes a double-reverse DNS test if the forward map
      of the reverse map includes the original IP. Regardless of
      the HostnameLookups setting, <a
      href="mod/mod_access.html">mod_access</a> access lists using
      DNS names <strong>require</strong> all names to pass a
      double-reverse DNS test. (Prior versions of Apache required a
      compile-time switch to enable double-reverse DNS.)</dd>

      <dt><strong>LogLevel and syslog support</strong></dt>

      <dd>Apache now has <a
      href="mod/core.html#loglevel">configurable error logging
      levels</a> and supports <a
      href="mod/core.html#errorlog">error logging via
      syslogd(8)</a>.</dd>

      <dt><strong>Detaching from stdin/out/err</strong></dt>

      <dd>On boot Apache will now detach from stdin, stdout, and
      stderr. It does not detach from stderr until it has
      successfully read the config files. So you will see errors in
      the config file. This should make it easier to start Apache
      via rsh or crontab.</dd>

      <dt><a id="y2k" name="y2k"><strong>Year-2000
      Improvements</strong></a></dt>

      <dd>The default <code>timefmt</code> string used by <a
      href="mod/mod_include.html"><code>mod_include</code></a> has
      been modified to display the year using four digits rather
      than the two-digit format used previously. The <a
      href="mod/mod_autoindex.html"><code>mod_autoindex</code></a>
      module has also been modified to display years using four
      digits in FancyIndexed directory listings.</dd>

      <dt><strong>Common routines Moving to a Separate
      Library</strong></dt>

      <dd>There are a number of functions and routines that have
      been developed for the Apache project that supplement or
      supersede library routines that differ from one operating
      system to another. While most of these are used only by the
      Apache server itself, some are referenced by supporting
      applications (such as <code>htdigest</code>), and these other
      applications would fail to build because the routines were
      built only into the server. These routines are now being
      migrated to a separate subdirectory and library so they can
      be used by other applications than just the server. See the
      <code>src/ap/</code> subdirectory.</dd>

      <dt><strong>New <code><a
      href="mod/core.html#serversignature">ServerSignature</a></code>
      directive</strong></dt>

      <dd>This directive optionally adds a line containing the
      server version and virtual host name to server-generated
      pages (error documents, ftp directory listings, mod_info
      output <em>etc.</em>). This makes it easier for users to tell
      which server produced the error message, especially in a
      proxy chain (often found in intranet environments).</dd>

      <dt><strong>New <code><a
      href="mod/core.html#usecanonicalname">UseCanonicalName</a></code>
      directive</strong></dt>

      <dd>This directive gives control over how Apache creates
      self-referential URLs. Previously Apache would always use the
      <a href="mod/core.html#servername">ServerName</a> and <a
      href="mod/core.html#port">Port</a> directives to construct a
      "canonical" name for the server. With <code>UseCanonicalName
      off</code> Apache will use the hostname and port supplied by
      the client, if available.</dd>

      <dt><strong><code>SERVER_VERSION</code> definition
      abstracted, and server build date added</strong></dt>

      <dd>In earlier versions, the Apache server version was
      available to modules through the <code>#define</code>d value
      for <code>SERVER_VERSION</code>. In order to keep this value
      consistent when modules and the core server are compiled at
      different times, this information is now available through
      the core API routine <code>ap_get_server_version()</code>.
      The use of the <code>SERVER_VERSION</code> symbol is
      deprecated. Also, <code>ap_get_server_built()</code> returns
      a string representing the time the core server was
      linked.</dd>

      <dt><a href="mod/core.html#servertokens"><strong>Including
      the operating system in the server
      identity</strong></a><br />
      </dt>

      <dd>A new directive, <code>ServerTokens</code>, allows the
      Webmaster to change the value of the <code>Server</code>
      response header field which is sent back to clients. The
      <code>ServerTokens</code> directive controls whether the
      server will include a non-specific note in the server
      identity about the type of operating system on which the
      server is running as well as included module information. As
      of Apache 1.3, this additional information is included by
      default.<br />

      password schemes where the password is encrypted using SHA1
      (as opposed to Apache's built in MD5 and/or the OS specific
      crypt(3) function ) passwords prefixed with with
      <code>{SHA1}</code> are taken as Base64 encoded SHA1
