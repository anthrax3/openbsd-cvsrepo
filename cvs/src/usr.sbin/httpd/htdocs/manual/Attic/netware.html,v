    <h2><a id="req" name="req">Requirements</a></h2>
    Apache 1.3 is designed to run on NetWare 5.x and above and is 
	installed by default on all NetWare 6 servers. 

    <p><strong>If running on NetWare 5.0 you must install Service
    Pack 5 or above.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>If running on NetWare 5.1 you must install Service
    Pack 1 or above.</strong></p>

    <p>NetWare service packs are available <a
    href="http://support.novell.com/misc/patlst.htm#nw">here.</a></p>

    <h2><a id="down" name="down">Downloading Apache for NetWare</a></h2>

    <p>Information on the latest version of Apache can be found on
    the Apache web server at <a
    href="http://www.apache.org/">http://www.apache.org/</a>. This
    will list the current release, any more recent alpha or
    beta-test releases, together with details of mirror web and
    anonymous ftp sites.</p>

    <h2><a id="inst" name="inst">Installing Apache for
    NetWare</a></h2>
    There is no Apache install program for NetWare currently. You
    will need to compile apache and copy the files over to the
    server manually. An install program will be posted at a later
    date. If you are running NetWare 6, Apache for NetWare has been 
	installed by default.

    <p>Follow these steps to install Apache on NetWare from the
    binary download (assuming you will install to sys:/apache):</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Unzip the binary download file to the root of the SYS:
      volume (may be installed to any volume)</li>

      <li>Edit the httpd.conf file setting ServerRoot and
      ServerName to reflect your correct server settings</li>

      <li>Add SYS:/APACHE to the search path. EXAMPLE: SEARCH ADD
      SYS:\APACHE</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Follow these steps to install Apache on NetWare manually
    from your own build source (assuming you will install to
    sys:/apache):</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Create a directory called <code>Apache</code> on a
      NetWare volume</li>

      <li>Copy Apache.nlm, Apachec.nlm, htdigest.nlm, htpasswd.nlm,
	  xmlparse.nlm, and xmltok.nlm to sys:/apache</li>

      <li>Create a directory under SYS:/APACHE called CONF</li>

      <li>Copy all the *.CONF-DIST-NW files to the SYS:/APACHE/CONF
      directory and rename them all as *.CONF files</li>

      <li>Copy the MIME.TYPES and magic files to SYS:/APACHE/CONF
      directory</li>

      <li>Copy all files and subdirectories in \apache-1.3\icons to
      SYS:/APACHE/ICONS</li>

      <li>Create the directory SYS:/APACHE/LOGS on the server</li>

      <li>Create the directory SYS:/APACHE/CGI-BIN on the
      server</li>

      <li>Create the directory SYS:/APACHE/MODULES and copy all nlm
      modules built into the modules directory</li>

      <li>Edit the HTTPD.CONF file setting ServerRoot and
      ServerName to reflect your correct server settings</li>

      <li>Add SYS:/APACHE to the search path. EXAMPLE: SEARCH ADD
      SYS:\APACHE</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Apache may be installed to other volumes besides the default
    <code>sys</code> volume.</p>

    <h2><a id="run" name="run">Running Apache for NetWare</a></h2>
    To start Apache just type <strong>apache</strong> at the
    console. This will load apache in the OS address space. If you
    prefer to load Apache in a protected address space you may
    specify the address space with the load statement as follows: 
<pre>
    load address space = apache apache
</pre>

    <p>This will load Apache into an address space called apache.
    Running multiple instances of Apache concurrently on NetWare is
    possible by loading each instance into its own protected
    address space.</p>

    <p>After starting Apache it will be listening to port 80
    (unless you changed the <samp>Port</samp>, <samp>Listen</samp>
    or <samp>BindAddress</samp> directives in the configuration
    files). To connect to the server and access the default page,
    launch a browser and enter the server's name or address. This
    should respond with a welcome page, and a link to the Apache
    manual. If nothing happens or you get an error, look in the
    <samp>error_log</samp> file in the <samp>logs</samp>
    directory.</p>

    <p>Once your basic installation is working, you should
    configure it properly by editing the files in the
    <samp>conf</samp> directory.</p>

    <p>To unload Apache running in the OS address space just type
    the following at the console:</p>
<pre>
    unload apache
</pre>
    If apache is running in a protected address space specify the
    address space in the unload statement: 
<pre>
    unload address space = apache apache
</pre>

    <p>When working with Apache it is important to know how it will
    find the configuration files. You can specify a configuration
    file on the command line in two ways:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>-f specifies a path to a particular configuration
      file</li>
    </ul>
<pre>
    apache -f "vol:/my server/conf/my.conf"
</pre>
<pre>
    apache -f test/test.conf
</pre>
    In these cases, the proper ServerRoot should be set in the
    configuration file. 

    <p>If you don't specify a configuration file name with -f,
    Apache will use the file name compiled into the server, usually
    "conf/httpd.conf". Invoking Apache with the -V switch will
    display this value labeled as SERVER_CONFIG_FILE. Apache will
    then determine its ServerRoot by trying the following, in this
    order:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>A ServerRoot directive via a -C switch.</li>

      <li>The -d switch on the command line.</li>

      <li>Current working directory</li>

      <li>The server root compiled into the server.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The server root compiled into the server is usually
    "sys:/apache". invoking apache with the -V switch will display
    this value labeled as HTTPD_ROOT.</p>

    <h2><a id="use" name="use">Configuring Apache for
    NetWare</a></h2>
    Apache is configured by files in the <samp>conf</samp>
    directory. These are the same as files used to configure the
    Unix version, but there are a few different directives for
    Apache on NetWare. See the <a href="./">Apache
    documentation</a> for all the available directives. 

    <p>The main differences in Apache for NetWare are:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Because Apache for NetWare is multithreaded, it does not
        use a separate process for each request, as Apache does
        with Unix. Instead there are only threads running: a parent
        thread, and a child which handles the requests. Within the
        child each request is handled by a separate thread.</p>

        <p>So the "process"-management directives are
        different:</p>

        <p><a
        href="mod/core.html#maxrequestsperchild">MaxRequestsPerChild</a>
        - Like the Unix directive, this controls how many requests
        a process will serve before exiting. However, unlike Unix,
        a process serves all the requests at once, not just one, so
        if this is set, it is recommended that a very high number
        is used. The recommended default, <code>MaxRequestsPerChild
        0</code>, does not cause the process to ever exit.</p>

        <p><a
        href="mod/core.html#threadsperchild">ThreadsPerChild</a> -
        This directive is new, and tells the server how many
        threads it should use. This is the maximum number of
        connections the server can handle at once; be sure and set
        this number high enough for your site if you get a lot of
        hits. The recommended default is <code>ThreadsPerChild
        50</code>.</p>
        <a href="mod/core.html#threadstacksize">ThreadStackSize</a>
        - This directive tells the server what size of stack to use
        for the individual threads. The recommended default is
        <code>ThreadStackSize 65536</code>.
        <p>LogRotateDaily - This directive allows all custom logs to be rotated
        on a daily basis.&nbsp; The file name of each log will contain the date
        and time that the log was created.&nbsp; The default for this directive
        is &quot;Off&quot;.</p>
        <p>LogRotateInterval - This directive allows all custom logs to be
        rotated on a specified interval.&nbsp; The file name of each log will
        contain the date and time that the log was created.&nbsp; The interval
        is specified as N minutes.&nbsp; The default is no interval or
        &quot;0&quot;.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>The directives that accept filenames as arguments now
        must use NetWare filenames instead of Unix ones. However,
        because Apache uses Unix-style names internally, you must
        use forward slashes, not backslashes. Volumes can be used;
        if omitted, the drive with the Apache executable will be
        assumed.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Apache for NetWare has the ability to load modules at
        runtime, without recompiling the server. If Apache is
        compiled normally, it will install a number of optional
        modules in the <code>\Apache\modules</code> directory. To
        activate these, or other modules, the new <a
        href="mod/mod_so.html#loadmodule">LoadModule</a> directive
        must be used. For example, to active the status module, use
        the following (in addition to the status-activating
        directives in <code>access.conf</code>):</p>
<pre>
    LoadModule status_module modules/status
</pre>

        <p>Information on <a
        href="mod/mod_so.html#creating">creating loadable
        modules</a> is also available.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2><a id="comp" name="comp">Compiling Apache for
    NetWare</a></h2>

    <p>Compiling Apache requires MetroWerks CodeWarrior 4.04 or
    higher to be properly installed.</p>

    <p>First, unpack the Apache distribution into an appropriate
    directory. Then go to the <code>src</code> subdirectory of the
    Apache distribution and unzip <code>ApacheNW.mcp.gz</code>. You
    may use a recent version of WinZip to accomplish this or gzip
    for Windows. The main Metrowerks project file for Apache
    <code>(ApacheNW.mcp)</code> is now ready to use. Just double
    click on it from within explorer and it should automatically
    launch MetroWerks CodeWarrior.</p>

    <p>All major pieces of Apache may be built using the
    ApacheNW.mcp project file. This includes modules such as
    status, info, and proxy.</p>

    <p>Once Apache has been built, it needs to be installed in its
    server root directory. The default is the
    <code>sys:/Apache</code> directory.</p>

    <p>Before running the server you must fill out the conf
    directory. Copy the *.conf-dist-nw from the distribution conf
    directory and rename *.conf. Edit the ServerRoot entries to
    your actual server root (for example "sys:/apache"). Copy over
    the conf/magic and conf/mime.types files as well.</p>

      So the "process"-management directives are different:
      <P><A
         HREF="mod/core.html#maxrequestsperchild">MaxRequestsPerChild</A>
         - Like the Unix directive, this controls how many requests a
           process will serve before exiting. However, unlike Unix, a
           process serves all the requests at once, not just one, so if
           this is set, it is recommended that a very high number is
           used. The recommended default, <CODE>MaxRequestsPerChild
           0</CODE>, does not cause the process to ever exit.
      <P><A HREF="mod/core.html#threadsperchild">ThreadsPerChild</A> -
         This directive is new, and tells the server how many threads it
         should use. This is the maximum number of connections the server
         can handle at once; be sure and set this number high enough for
         your site if you get a lot of hits. The recommended default is
         <CODE>ThreadsPerChild 50</CODE>.
      </P><A HREF="mod/core.html#threadstacksize">ThreadStackSize</A> -
         This directive tells the server what size of stack to use for
         the individual threads.  The recommended default is
         <CODE>ThreadStackSize 65536</CODE>.
      <P>
  <LI><P>The directives that accept filenames as arguments now must use
      NetWare filenames instead of Unix ones. However, because Apache
      uses Unix-style names internally, you must use forward slashes, not
      backslashes. Volumes can be used; if omitted, the drive with the
      Apache executable will be assumed.</P>
  <LI><P>Apache for NetWare contains the ability to load modules at runtime,
      without recompiling the server. If Apache is compiled normally, it
      will install a number of optional modules in the
      <CODE>\Apache\modules</CODE> directory. To activate these, or other
      modules, the new <A HREF="mod/mod_so.html#loadmodule">LoadModule</A>
      directive must be used. For example, to active the status module,
      use the following (in addition to the status-activating directives
      in <CODE>access.conf</CODE>):</P>

<P>First, unpack the Apache distribution into an appropriate

   distribution and unzip <CODE>ApacheNW.mcp.gz</CODE>. You may use a
   recent version of WinZip to accomplish this or gzip for Windows. The main

</P>
<P>Once Apache has been built, it needs to be installed in its server
   root directory. The default is the <CODE>sys:/Apache</CODE>
   directory. </P>
<P>
Before running the server you must fill out the conf directory.
Copy the *.conf-dist-nw from the distribution conf directory
and rename *.conf.  Edit the ServerRoot entries to your
actual server root (for example "sys:/apache").  Copy over
the conf/magic and conf/mime.types files as well.

    <h2><a id="req" name="req">Requirements</a></h2>
    Apache 1.3 is designed to run on NetWare 5.x and above and is 
	installed by default on all NetWare 6 servers. 

    <p><strong>If running on NetWare 5.0 you must install Service
    Pack 5 or above.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>If running on NetWare 5.1 you must install Service
    Pack 1 or above.</strong></p>

    <p>NetWare service packs are available <a
    href="http://support.novell.com/misc/patlst.htm#nw">here.</a></p>

    <h2><a id="down" name="down">Downloading Apache for NetWare</a></h2>

    <p>Information on the latest version of Apache can be found on
    the Apache web server at <a
    href="http://www.apache.org/">http://www.apache.org/</a>. This
    will list the current release, any more recent alpha or
    beta-test releases, together with details of mirror web and
    anonymous ftp sites.</p>

    <h2><a id="inst" name="inst">Installing Apache for
    NetWare</a></h2>
    There is no Apache install program for NetWare currently. You
    will need to compile apache and copy the files over to the
    server manually. An install program will be posted at a later
    date. If you are running NetWare 6, Apache for NetWare has been 
	installed by default.

    <p>Follow these steps to install Apache on NetWare from the
    binary download (assuming you will install to sys:/apache):</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Unzip the binary download file to the root of the SYS:
      volume (may be installed to any volume)</li>

      <li>Edit the httpd.conf file setting ServerRoot and
      ServerName to reflect your correct server settings</li>

      <li>Add SYS:/APACHE to the search path. EXAMPLE: SEARCH ADD
      SYS:\APACHE</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Follow these steps to install Apache on NetWare manually
    from your own build source (assuming you will install to
    sys:/apache):</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Create a directory called <code>Apache</code> on a
      NetWare volume</li>

      <li>Copy Apache.nlm, Apachec.nlm, htdigest.nlm, htpasswd.nlm,
	  xmlparse.nlm, and xmltok.nlm to sys:/apache</li>

      <li>Create a directory under SYS:/APACHE called CONF</li>

      <li>Copy all the *.CONF-DIST-NW files to the SYS:/APACHE/CONF
      directory and rename them all as *.CONF files</li>

      <li>Copy the MIME.TYPES and magic files to SYS:/APACHE/CONF
      directory</li>

      <li>Copy all files and subdirectories in \apache-1.3\icons to
      SYS:/APACHE/ICONS</li>

      <li>Create the directory SYS:/APACHE/LOGS on the server</li>

      <li>Create the directory SYS:/APACHE/CGI-BIN on the
      server</li>

      <li>Create the directory SYS:/APACHE/MODULES and copy all nlm
      modules built into the modules directory</li>

      <li>Edit the HTTPD.CONF file setting ServerRoot and
      ServerName to reflect your correct server settings</li>

      <li>Add SYS:/APACHE to the search path. EXAMPLE: SEARCH ADD
      SYS:\APACHE</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Apache may be installed to other volumes besides the default
    <code>sys</code> volume.</p>

    <h2><a id="run" name="run">Running Apache for NetWare</a></h2>
    To start Apache just type <strong>apache</strong> at the
    console. This will load apache in the OS address space. If you
    prefer to load Apache in a protected address space you may
    specify the address space with the load statement as follows: 
<pre>
d119 26
a144 24
</pre>

    <p>This will load Apache into an address space called apache.
    Running multiple instances of Apache concurrently on NetWare is
    possible by loading each instance into its own protected
    address space.</p>

    <p>After starting Apache it will be listening to port 80
    (unless you changed the <samp>Port</samp>, <samp>Listen</samp>
    or <samp>BindAddress</samp> directives in the configuration
    files). To connect to the server and access the default page,
    launch a browser and enter the server's name or address. This
    should respond with a welcome page, and a link to the Apache
    manual. If nothing happens or you get an error, look in the
    <samp>error_log</samp> file in the <samp>logs</samp>
    directory.</p>

    <p>Once your basic installation is working, you should
    configure it properly by editing the files in the
    <samp>conf</samp> directory.</p>

    <p>To unload Apache running in the OS address space just type
    the following at the console:</p>
<pre>
d146 4
a149 4
</pre>
    If apache is running in a protected address space specify the
    address space in the unload statement: 
<pre>
d151 1
a151 1
</pre>
d153 86
a238 112
    <p>When working with Apache it is important to know how it will
    find the configuration files. You can specify a configuration
    file on the command line in two ways:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>-f specifies a path to a particular configuration
      file</li>
    </ul>
<pre>
    apache -f "vol:/my server/conf/my.conf"
</pre>
<pre>
    apache -f test/test.conf
</pre>
    In these cases, the proper ServerRoot should be set in the
    configuration file. 

    <p>If you don't specify a configuration file name with -f,
    Apache will use the file name compiled into the server, usually
    "conf/httpd.conf". Invoking Apache with the -V switch will
    display this value labeled as SERVER_CONFIG_FILE. Apache will
    then determine its ServerRoot by trying the following, in this
    order:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>A ServerRoot directive via a -C switch.</li>

      <li>The -d switch on the command line.</li>

      <li>Current working directory</li>

      <li>The server root compiled into the server.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The server root compiled into the server is usually
    "sys:/apache". invoking apache with the -V switch will display
    this value labeled as HTTPD_ROOT.</p>

    <h2><a id="use" name="use">Configuring Apache for
    NetWare</a></h2>
    Apache is configured by files in the <samp>conf</samp>
    directory. These are the same as files used to configure the
    Unix version, but there are a few different directives for
    Apache on NetWare. See the <a href="./">Apache
    documentation</a> for all the available directives. 

    <p>The main differences in Apache for NetWare are:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Because Apache for NetWare is multithreaded, it does not
        use a separate process for each request, as Apache does
        with Unix. Instead there are only threads running: a parent
        thread, and a child which handles the requests. Within the
        child each request is handled by a separate thread.</p>

        <p>So the "process"-management directives are
        different:</p>

        <p><a
        href="mod/core.html#maxrequestsperchild">MaxRequestsPerChild</a>
        - Like the Unix directive, this controls how many requests
        a process will serve before exiting. However, unlike Unix,
        a process serves all the requests at once, not just one, so
        if this is set, it is recommended that a very high number
        is used. The recommended default, <code>MaxRequestsPerChild
        0</code>, does not cause the process to ever exit.</p>

        <p><a
        href="mod/core.html#threadsperchild">ThreadsPerChild</a> -
        This directive is new, and tells the server how many
        threads it should use. This is the maximum number of
        connections the server can handle at once; be sure and set
        this number high enough for your site if you get a lot of
        hits. The recommended default is <code>ThreadsPerChild
        50</code>.</p>
        <a href="mod/core.html#threadstacksize">ThreadStackSize</a>
        - This directive tells the server what size of stack to use
        for the individual threads. The recommended default is
        <code>ThreadStackSize 65536</code>.
        <p>LogRotateDaily - This directive allows all custom logs to be rotated
        on a daily basis.&nbsp; The file name of each log will contain the date
        and time that the log was created.&nbsp; The default for this directive
        is &quot;Off&quot;.</p>
        <p>LogRotateInterval - This directive allows all custom logs to be
        rotated on a specified interval.&nbsp; The file name of each log will
        contain the date and time that the log was created.&nbsp; The interval
        is specified as N minutes.&nbsp; The default is no interval or
        &quot;0&quot;.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>The directives that accept filenames as arguments now
        must use NetWare filenames instead of Unix ones. However,
        because Apache uses Unix-style names internally, you must
        use forward slashes, not backslashes. Volumes can be used;
        if omitted, the drive with the Apache executable will be
        assumed.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Apache for NetWare has the ability to load modules at
        runtime, without recompiling the server. If Apache is
        compiled normally, it will install a number of optional
        modules in the <code>\Apache\modules</code> directory. To
        activate these, or other modules, the new <a
        href="mod/mod_so.html#loadmodule">LoadModule</a> directive
        must be used. For example, to active the status module, use
        the following (in addition to the status-activating
        directives in <code>access.conf</code>):</p>
<pre>
d240 47

        href="mod/mod_so.html#creating">creating loadable
        modules</a> is also available.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2><a id="comp" name="comp">Compiling Apache for
