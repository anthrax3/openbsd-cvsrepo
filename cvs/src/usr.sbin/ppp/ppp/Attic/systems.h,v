@Support RADIUS

While I'm in there, validate pap & chap header IDs if
``idcheck'' is enabled (the default) for other FSM packet
types.

NOTE: This involved integrating the generation of chap
      challenges and the validation of chap responses
      (and commenting what's going on in those routines).
      I currently have no way of testing ppps ability
      to respond to M$Chap CHALLENGEs correctly, so if
      someone could do the honours, it'd be much
      appreciated (it *looks* ok!).

1.1
log
@Upgrade ppp to version 2.0

This adds a number of features including:
o Multilink
o Callback (including CBCP)
o DNS negotiation (client & server)
o Easy to configure masquerading/packet aliasing
o Any number of diagnostic socket connections (limits DOS attacks)
o Sticky routes (ppp updates the routing table when the IP number is changed)

See the file README.changes for things that effect current
configurations.
