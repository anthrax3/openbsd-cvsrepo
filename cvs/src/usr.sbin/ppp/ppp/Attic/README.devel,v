This file summarises changes made to ppp that effect
This program was originally written by Toshiharu OHNO <tony-o@@iij.ad.jp>,
and was submitted to FreeBSD-2.0.5 by Atsushi Murai <amurai@@spec.co.jp>.
The original version was usually referred to as iij-ppp.

Ppp is currently maintained under FreeBSD and OpenBSD by Brian Somers
<brian@@Awfulhak.org>.  The sources for both operating systems are the
same except that the libalias code is built directly into ppp under
OpenBSD, and the Makefiles vary per OS.

The latest sources are available in FreeBSD-current and OpenBSD-current.
An archive hacked so that it will build on just about any version of
FreeBSD or OpenBSD is frequently generated and made available via
http://www.Awfulhak.org/ppp.html.

A FAQ is available at
http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/faq/ppp.html.  It
applies equally to OpenBSD as it does to FreeBSD.  The man page is
quite extensive, and there are lots of examples in
/etc/ppp/.

Ppp is still under development.  There is no official TODO list.

@Add IPv6 support.

IPV6CP support is crude for now, and hasn't been tested against
any other implementations.  RADIUS and IPv6 are independent of
eachother for now.  ppp.linkup/ppp.linkdown aren't currently used
by IPV6CP

Understand all protocols(5) in filter rules rather than only a select
few.

Allow a mask specification for the ``delete'' command.  It's now
possible to specifically delete one of two conflicting routes.

When creating and deleting proxy arp entries, do it for all IPv4
interface addresses rather than doing it just for the ``current''
peer address.

When iface-alias isn't in effect, don't blow away manually (via ``iface
add'') added interface addresses.

When listening on a tcp server (diagnostic) socket, bind so that a
tcp46 socket is created -- allowing both IPv4 and IPv6 connections.

When displaying ICMP traffic, don't display the icmp type twice.

When display traffic, display at least some information about unrecognised
traffic.

@Upgrade ppp to version 2.0

This adds a number of features including:
o Multilink
o Callback (including CBCP)
o DNS negotiation (client & server)
o Easy to configure masquerading/packet aliasing
o Any number of diagnostic socket connections (limits DOS attacks)
o Sticky routes (ppp updates the routing table when the IP number is changed)

See the file README.changes for things that effect current
configurations.

same except that OpenBSD is missing some files (the OpenBSD project
does not want libalias - not as a library anyway) and the Makefiles vary
due to the nature of each system.  If and when it's ported to another OS,
things will probably be shuffled around so that there are several Makefiles,
one per architecture.

come with the hacked archive above but must be installed manually with
``make etc-install''.
