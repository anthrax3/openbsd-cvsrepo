log
@Maintain a `necessary' marker to indicate that we *probably*
need to process a signal (usually a SIGALRM).  Check to see
if we need to process a signal both before *and* after calling
select() as older (pre-2.0) versions of ppp used to.

This handles the possibility that ppp may block at some
point (maybe due to an open() of a misconfigured device).
Previously, we'd potentially lock up in select().

The `necessary' marker reduces the increased signal checking
overhead so that at full speed with no compression transferring
an 83Mb file via a ``!ppp -direct'' device, we get a 1%
throughput gain.

@Support RADIUS

While I'm in there, validate pap & chap header IDs if
``idcheck'' is enabled (the default) for other FSM packet
types.

NOTE: This involved integrating the generation of chap
      challenges and the validation of chap responses
      (and commenting what's going on in those routines).
      I currently have no way of testing ppps ability
      to respond to M$Chap CHALLENGEs correctly, so if
      someone could do the honours, it'd be much
      appreciated (it *looks* ok!).

@Upgrade ppp to version 2.0

This adds a number of features including:
o Multilink
o Callback (including CBCP)
o DNS negotiation (client & server)
o Easy to configure masquerading/packet aliasing
o Any number of diagnostic socket connections (limits DOS attacks)
o Sticky routes (ppp updates the routing table when the IP number is changed)

See the file README.changes for things that effect current
configurations.
