@Add IPv6 support.

IPV6CP support is crude for now, and hasn't been tested against
any other implementations.  RADIUS and IPv6 are independent of
eachother for now.  ppp.linkup/ppp.linkdown aren't currently used
by IPV6CP

Understand all protocols(5) in filter rules rather than only a select
few.

Allow a mask specification for the ``delete'' command.  It's now
possible to specifically delete one of two conflicting routes.

When creating and deleting proxy arp entries, do it for all IPv4
interface addresses rather than doing it just for the ``current''
peer address.

When iface-alias isn't in effect, don't blow away manually (via ``iface
add'') added interface addresses.

When listening on a tcp server (diagnostic) socket, bind so that a
tcp46 socket is created -- allowing both IPv4 and IPv6 connections.

When displaying ICMP traffic, don't display the icmp type twice.

When display traffic, display at least some information about unrecognised
traffic.

1.1
log
@o Redesign the layering mechanism and make the aliasing code part of
  the layering.

  We now ``stack'' layers as soon as we open the device (when we figure
  out what we're dealing with).  A static set of `dispatch' routines are
  also declared for dealing with incoming packets after they've been
  `pulled' up through the stacked layers.

  Physical devices are now assigned handlers based on the device type
  when they're opened.  For the moment there are three device types;
  ttys, execs and tcps.

o Increment version number to 2.2
o Make an entry in [uw]tmp for non-tty -direct invocations (after
  pap/chap authentication).
o Make throughput counters quad_t's
o Account for the absolute number of mbuf malloc()s and free()s in
  ``show mem''.
o ``show modem'' becomes ``show physical''.
