@Change ``ifdef HAVE_DES'' to ``ifndef NODES'' for consistency.
Notice if the IP header length changes when doing transparent proxying; FreeBSD
Handle domain\\user entries in ppp.secret
Add some mp_Down() calls to ensure that our multi-link NCP goes away properly
Miscellaneous #ifdef'd out FreeBSD changes (mostly netgraph stuff).

@o Redesign the layering mechanism and make the aliasing code part of
  the layering.

  We now ``stack'' layers as soon as we open the device (when we figure
  out what we're dealing with).  A static set of `dispatch' routines are
  also declared for dealing with incoming packets after they've been
  `pulled' up through the stacked layers.

  Physical devices are now assigned handlers based on the device type
  when they're opened.  For the moment there are three device types;
  ttys, execs and tcps.

o Increment version number to 2.2
o Make an entry in [uw]tmp for non-tty -direct invocations (after
  pap/chap authentication).
o Make throughput counters quad_t's
o Account for the absolute number of mbuf malloc()s and free()s in
  ``show mem''.
o ``show modem'' becomes ``show physical''.

@Support RADIUS

While I'm in there, validate pap & chap header IDs if
``idcheck'' is enabled (the default) for other FSM packet
types.

NOTE: This involved integrating the generation of chap
      challenges and the validation of chap responses
      (and commenting what's going on in those routines).
      I currently have no way of testing ppps ability
      to respond to M$Chap CHALLENGEs correctly, so if
      someone could do the honours, it'd be much
      appreciated (it *looks* ok!).

@Upgrade ppp to version 2.0

This adds a number of features including:
o Multilink
o Callback (including CBCP)
o DNS negotiation (client & server)
o Easy to configure masquerading/packet aliasing
o Any number of diagnostic socket connections (limits DOS attacks)
o Sticky routes (ppp updates the routing table when the IP number is changed)

See the file README.changes for things that effect current
configurations.
