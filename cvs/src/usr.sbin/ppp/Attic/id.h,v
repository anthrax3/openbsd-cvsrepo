@Upgrade ppp to version 2.0

This adds a number of features including:
o Multilink
o Callback (including CBCP)
o DNS negotiation (client & server)
o Easy to configure masquerading/packet aliasing
o Any number of diagnostic socket connections (limits DOS attacks)
o Sticky routes (ppp updates the routing table when the IP number is changed)

See the file README.changes for things that effect current
configurations.

1.1.1.1
log
@Import version 1.5 of ppp.

<sales>
This is a user-level ppp implementation that uses the
tun driver.  It was originally created by a Japanese
ISP.  It's now piled with features.  Check the man pages
for details.
</sales>

The sources are identical to the ones in FreeBSD, except
for the Makefile.

IP aliasing (NAT) is disabled, and can be enabled by simply
doing a ``make install'' of libalias, then rebuilding
ppp.  I'll create libalias as a port soon.
