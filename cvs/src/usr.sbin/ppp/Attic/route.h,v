1.5
log
@Upgrade ppp to version 2.0

This adds a number of features including:
o Multilink
o Callback (including CBCP)
o DNS negotiation (client & server)
o Easy to configure masquerading/packet aliasing
o Any number of diagnostic socket connections (limits DOS attacks)
o Sticky routes (ppp updates the routing table when the IP number is changed)

See the file README.changes for things that effect current
configurations.

Allow "delete! dst" (note the ``!'') to silently

Also, make the ESRCH and EEXIST error conditions
more understandable to the casual observer.

log
@Allow random IP number allocation to peer.
Validate the peers suggested IP by attempting to make a routing table
entry.
Give up IPCP negotiation if the peer NAKs us with an unusable IP.
Always SIOCDIFADDR then SIOCAIFADDR when configuring the tun device.
Using SIOCSIFDSTADDR allows duplicate dst addresses (which we don't
want)!!!
Allow up to 200 interface names (was 50) (now that ppp can play server
properly).

Cosmetic:
  Log unexpected CCP packets in the CCP log rather than the ERROR log.
  Log unexpected Config Reqs in the appropriate LCP/IPCP/CCP log rather
  than the ERROR log.
  Log failed route additions and deletions with WARN, not TCPIP.
  Log the option id and length for unrecognised IPCP options.
  Change some .Sq to .Ar in the man page.

1.1.1.1
log
@Import version 1.5 of ppp.

<sales>
This is a user-level ppp implementation that uses the
tun driver.  It was originally created by a Japanese
ISP.  It's now piled with features.  Check the man pages
for details.
</sales>

The sources are identical to the ones in FreeBSD, except
for the Makefile.

IP aliasing (NAT) is disabled, and can be enabled by simply
doing a ``make install'' of libalias, then rebuilding
ppp.  I'll create libalias as a port soon.
