@Upgrade ppp to version 2.0

This adds a number of features including:
o Multilink
o Callback (including CBCP)
o DNS negotiation (client & server)
o Easy to configure masquerading/packet aliasing
o Any number of diagnostic socket connections (limits DOS attacks)
o Sticky routes (ppp updates the routing table when the IP number is changed)

See the file README.changes for things that effect current
configurations.

@This program was originally written by Toshiharu OHNO <tony-o@@iij.ad.jp>,
and was submitted to FreeBSD-2.0.5 by Atsushi Murai <amurai@@spec.co.jp>.
The original version was usually referred to as iij-ppp.

Ppp is currently maintained under FreeBSD and OpenBSD by Brian Somers
<brian@@Awfulhak.org>.  The sources for both operating systems are the
same although the Makefiles vary due to the nature of each system.
If and when it's ported to another OS, things will probably be shuffled
around so that there are several Makefiles, one per architecture.

The latest sources are available in FreeBSD-current and OpenBSD-current.
An archive hacked so that it will build on just about any version of
FreeBSD is frequently generated and made available on
http://www.FreeBSD.org/~brian.  Once the first OpenBSD release is made
with ppp, an up-to-date OpenBSD archive will be made available too.

A FAQ is available at http://www.FreeBSD.org/FAQ/userppp.html.  It applies
equally to OpenBSD as it does to FreeBSD.  The man page is quite extensive,
and there are lots of examples in /etc/ppp/ppp.*.sample.  These examples
come with the hacked archive above but must be installed manually.

Ppp is still under development.  There is no official TODO list.
