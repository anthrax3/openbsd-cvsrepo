@Upgrade ppp to version 2.0

This adds a number of features including:
o Multilink
o Callback (including CBCP)
o DNS negotiation (client & server)
o Easy to configure masquerading/packet aliasing
o Any number of diagnostic socket connections (limits DOS attacks)
o Sticky routes (ppp updates the routing table when the IP number is changed)

See the file README.changes for things that effect current
configurations.
