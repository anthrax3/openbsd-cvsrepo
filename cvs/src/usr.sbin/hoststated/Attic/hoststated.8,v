@hoststated/hoststatectl get repository copied (and de-tagged) into
relayd/relayctl.  This is a more suitable place for a daemon that has
grown out of it's initial roots of "monitoring and redirecting services
at various layers", into one that is "a full featured proxy, which
happens to know what is up/down"

.Nm hoststated
.Nd Host Status daemon
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl dnv
.Oo Xo
.Fl D Ar macro Ns = Ns Ar value Oc
.Xc
.Op Fl f Ar file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a host status daemon for server load-balancing.
It monitors groups of hosts for availability,
which is determined by checking for a specific service
common to a host group.
When availability is confirmed, Layer 3 and/or Layer 7
load-balancing services are set up by
.Nm .
.Pp
Layer 3 load-balancing happens at the packet level; to configure
it,
.Nm
communicates with
.Xr pf 4 .
To allow
.Nm
to properly set up
.Xr pf 4
rules, the following line is required in the NAT section of
.Xr pf.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
rdr-anchor "hoststated/*"
.Ed
.Pp
Layer 7 load-balancing happens at the application level and is
handled by
.Nm
itself.
.Pp
.Nm
works in terms of the following
.Em entities :
relays, protocols, services, and tables.
A
.Em relay
represents a Layer 7 load-balancing instance.
Each instance translates to a listening TCP or UDP port.
A
.Em protocol
defines which actions, if any, must be taken on the
packet payload as data crosses a relay.
A
.Em service
represents a Layer 3 load-balancing instance.
Each instance translates to a
.Xr pf 4
rdr rule being added.
A
.Em table
represents a group of hosts which can be checked for
availability using the same method.
Each table contains at least one host.
If a table is used in a Layer 3 load-balancing instance, it
will be mapped to a
.Xr pf 4
table containing only hosts which are up.
.Pp
All these entities can be configured in
.Xr hoststated.conf 5
and
.Xr hoststatectl 8
can be used to alter or report the status of each entity.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl D Ar macro Ns = Ns Ar value
Define
.Ar macro
to be set to
.Ar value
on the command line.
Overrides the definition of
.Ar macro
in the configuration file.
.It Fl d
Do not daemonize.
If this option is specified,
.Nm
will run in the foreground and log to
.Em stderr .
.It Fl f Ar file
Specify an alternative configuration file.
The default is
.Pa /etc/hoststated.conf .
.It Fl n
Configtest mode.
Only check the configuration file for validity.
.It Fl v
Produce more verbose output.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width "/var/run/hoststated.sockXX" -compact
.It /etc/hoststated.conf
Default
.Nm
configuration file.
.It /var/run/hoststated.sock
Unix-domain socket used for communication with
.Xr hoststatectl 8 .

as well as any related pf rdr rules.
To communicate with pf,

manipulates three data types: services, tables, and hosts.
Each service represents a
d86 3
a88 8
rdr rule.
A service contains at least one table and one virtual IP which are
used to create the proper rule.
Each table contains at least one host, and is mapped to a pf table.
Additionally a table can be backed up i.e. its content will be swapped
by the content of another table when it is empty.
This can be used to serve static content when a dynamic service goes down.
See
d90 1
a90 3
for a more detailed explanation of how to configure
.Nm .
.Pp
d92 1
a92 2
can be used to enable or disable hosts, tables, and services as well
as showing the current status of each object.

@Import hostated, the host status daemon.  This daemon will monitor
remote hosts and dynamically alter pf(4) tables and redirection rules
for active server load balancing.  The daemon has been written by
Pierre-Yves Ritschard (pyr at spootnik.org) and was formerly known as
"slbd".

The daemon is fully functional but it still needs some work and
cleanup so we don't link it to the build yet.  Some TODOs are a
partial rewrite of the check_* routines (use libevent whenever we
can), improvement of the manpages, and general knf and cleanup.
