/* This module contains global variables that are exported by the PCRE library.
PCRE is thread-clean and doesn't use any global variables in the normal sense.
However, it calls memory allocation and freeing functions via the four
indirections below, and it can optionally do callouts, using the fifth
indirection. These values can be changed by the caller, but are shared between
all threads.

For MS Visual Studio and Symbian OS, there are problems in initializing these
variables to non-local functions. In these cases, therefore, an indirection via
a local function is used.

Also, when compiling for Virtual Pascal, things are done differently, and
global variables are not used. */

@import of nginx 1.0.6 with a bundled libpcre needed for pcre to work
properly.
this is not yet linked to the build but we would like to work on it
in tree to provide an apache replacement for base
