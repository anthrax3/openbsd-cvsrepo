@Get rid of unused empty file, pw_scan.h.  Nothing uses it anymore.
When building .db versions of passwd and master.passwd, go split
the loops into three (one per key type) so that we get good locality
withing the .db file for getnext style operations (getpwent).  With
this change I see about a 20% speedup of getpwent() on very large
passwd files.
