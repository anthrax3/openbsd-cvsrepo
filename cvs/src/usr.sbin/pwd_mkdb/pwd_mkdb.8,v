@Assorted simple improvements:
- Considerably simplify the first paragraph; suggested by Raf Czlonka.
- No need to say twice that "file" must be in the correct format.
- Clarify which file is checked by -c.
- Clarify that -p creates passwd(5) in addition, not instead.
- Simplify reference to the master.passwd(5) format.
- Turn one sentence into a standard EXIT STATUS section.
- New HISTORY and AUTHORS sections, based on the CSRG archive CDs.

.Sh NAME
.Nm pwd_mkdb
.Nd generate the password databases
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm pwd_mkdb
.Op Fl c
.Op Fl p | s
.Op Fl d Ar directory
.Op Fl u Ar username
.Ar file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
creates a pair of Berkeley databases from
.Ar file
and installs them into
.Pa /etc/spwd.db
and
.Pa /etc/pwd.db .
The
.Ar file
argument is renamed to
.Pa /etc/master.passwd .
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl c
Check whether
.Ar file
is in the correct format.
Do not change, add, or remove any files.
.It Fl d Ar directory
Operate in a base directory other than the default of
.Pa /etc .
All absolute paths (including
.Ar file )
will be made relative to
.Ar directory .
Any directories specified as a part of
.Ar file
will be stripped off.
This option is used to create password databases in directories
other than
.Pa /etc ;
for instance in a
.Xr chroot 8
jail.
.It Fl p
Also create a legacy password file and install it into
.Pa /etc/passwd .
.It Fl s
Only update the secure version of the database.
This is most commonly used in conjunction with the
.Fl u
flag during a password change.
Because the insecure database doesn't contain the password there
is no reason to update it if the only change is in the password field.
Cannot be used in conjunction with the
.Fl p
flag.
.It Fl u Ar username
Only update the record for the specified user.
Utilities that operate on a single user can use this option to avoid the
overhead of rebuilding the entire database.
This option must never be used if the line number of the user's record in
.Pa /etc/master.passwd
has changed.
.It Ar file
The absolute path to a file in
.Xr master.passwd 5
format.
.El
.Pp
The two databases differ in that the secure version contains the user's
encrypted password and the insecure version has an asterisk
.Pq Sq \&* .
.Pp
The databases are used by the C library password routines (see
.Xr getpwent 3 ) .
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /etc/master.passwd -compact
.It Pa /etc/master.passwd
current password file
.It Pa /etc/passwd
legacy password file
.It Pa /etc/pwd.db
insecure password database file
.It Pa /etc/pwd.db.tmp
temporary file
.It Pa /etc/spwd.db
secure password database file
.It Pa /etc/spwd.db.tmp
temporary file
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr chpass 1 ,
.Xr passwd 1 ,
.Xr dbopen 3 ,
.Xr getpwent 3 ,
.Xr passwd 5 ,
.Xr vipw 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
utility first appeared in
.Bx 4.3 Net/2 .
.Sh AUTHORS
.An Keith Bostic
.Sh BUGS
Because of the necessity for atomic update of the password files,
.Nm
uses
.Xr rename 2
to install them.
This, however, requires that the file specified on the command line live
on the same file system as the
.Pa /etc
directory.
.Pp
There are the obvious races with multiple people running
.Nm
on different password files at the same time.
The front-ends to
.Nm pwd_mkdb ,
.Xr chpass 1 ,
.Xr passwd 1 ,
and
.Xr vipw 8
handle the locking necessary to avoid this problem.
