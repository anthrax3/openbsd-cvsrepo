.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm rpc.lockd
.Nd NFS file locking daemon
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm rpc.lockd
.Op Fl d Op Ar debug_level
.Op Fl g Ar grace_period
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm rpc.lockd
is a daemon which provides file- and record-locking services in an NFS
environment.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl d Op Ar debug_level
Write debugging information to syslog, recording
all RPC transactions to the daemon.
These messages are logged with level
.Dv LOG_DEBUG
and facility
.Dv LOG_DAEMON .
If
.Ar debug_level
is not specified,
level 1 is assumed, giving one log line per protocol operation.
Higher debug levels can be specified, causing display of operation arguments
and internal operations of the daemon.
.It Fl g Ar grace_period
Specify the grace period, in seconds.
During the grace period
.Nm
only accepts requests from hosts which are reinitialising locks which
existed before the server restart.
The default is 30 seconds.
.El
.Pp
Error conditions are logged to syslog, irrespective of the debug level,
using log level
.Dv LOG_ERR
and facility
.Dv LOG_DAEMON .
.Pp
The
.Nm rpc.lockd
daemon must NOT be invoked by
.Xr inetd 8
because the protocol assumes that the daemon will run from system start time.
Instead, it should be run from
.Xr rc 8
after the network has been started.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /usr/include/rpcsvc/nlm_prot.x -compact
.It Pa /usr/include/rpcsvc/nlm_prot.x
RPC protocol specification for the network lock manager protocol.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr syslog 3 ,
.Xr rc 8
.Sh STANDARDS
The implementation is based on the specification in X/Open CAE Specification
C218, "Protocols for X/Open PC Interworking: XNFS, Issue 4", ISBN 1 872630 66 9
.Sh BUGS
The current implementation provides only the server side of the protocol
(i.e., clients running other OS types can establish locks on an
.Ox
fileserver,
but there is currently no means for an
.Ox
client to establish locks).
.Pp
The current implementation serialises lock requests that could be shared.
@


1.12
log
@from NetBSD:
Implement file locking in lockd. All the stuff is done in userland, using
fhopen() and flock(). This means that if you kill lockd, all locks will
be relased.
Shared locks are not handled efficiently, they're serialised in lockd when
they could be granted.

tested against debian etch (linux 2.6.18)
not fully functional yet in mixed NFSv2/v3 environments
further development in-tree as discussed w/ deraadt

Versions 1, 2 and 3 of the protocol are supported.
However, only versions
2 (Unix systems) and 3 (PC-NFS clients) seem to be in common use - the version
1 support has not been tested due to the lack of version 1 clients against
which to test.
