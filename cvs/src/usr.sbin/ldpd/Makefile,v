@work on making log.c similar in all daemons:

move daemon-local functions into new logmsg.c, and reduce
the (mostly whitespace) differences so that log.c's can be diffed easily.

removal of log_rtmsg() aproved by claudio@@

@Move setsockopt helper functions to a separate file.

IPv6 support is coming and we don't want to pollute the interface.c file
with too many of these helper functions.

Also, rename these functions from if_set_* to sock_set_*.

1.8
log
@Several improvements in the parsing of UDP/Hello packets.

* Fix check of the packet's size and the "PDU Length" field;
* Add check for the "Message Length" field;
* Check for invalid labelspace earlier.
* Use if_lookup() on disc_recv_iface() to reduce one level of identation;

Additionally, add the following safeguards:
* Check for unicast link hellos;
* Check for multicast targeted hellos;
* Validate packet's source address;
* Validate received transport-address.

Put the ancillary function bad_ip_addr() into a new file, util.c, which
will be used later for several other things.

@accept pacing ldpd way. Since this daemon has multiple listening fds
we add them all to a accept queue that does the pacing with the
accept_pause() and accept_unpause() calls.

@Welcome ldpd, the Label Distribution Protocol daemon.
Built using the imsg/three process framework, its main aim
is to redistribute MPLS labels between peers.

Right now it has some really basic functionalities,
the basic protocol works and peers are able to exchange
labels and insert them in the kernel.
It still does not react to changes of topology.

Not yet connected to the builds.
