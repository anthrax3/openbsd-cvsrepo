1.1
log
@amd's nfs_prot.x file has some tweaks from the standard; automate them with ed.
Regenerate the amd's NFS RPC stubs with a current rpcgen, automating the
  post-generation tweaks to the svc stubs.  However, do follow the modern
  naming style where the svc stubs have a _svc suffix.
As a side benefit, this eliminates the need to #include <nfs/nfsproto.h>
This is all a prelude to updating amd to talk NFSv3 with the kernel for
  its own "toplvl" mounts, to squash another y2038 issue.
