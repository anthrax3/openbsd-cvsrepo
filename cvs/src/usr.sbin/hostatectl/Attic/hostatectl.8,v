@- allow to use host/service/table names instead of Ids in hostatectl.
- minor change of the "hostatectl show" command output

1.1
log
@Import hostated, the host status daemon.  This daemon will monitor
remote hosts and dynamically alter pf(4) tables and redirection rules
for active server load balancing.  The daemon has been written by
Pierre-Yves Ritschard (pyr at spootnik.org) and was formerly known as
"slbd".

The daemon is fully functional but it still needs some work and
cleanup so we don't link it to the build yet.  Some TODOs are a
partial rewrite of the check_* routines (use libevent whenever we
can), improvement of the manpages, and general knf and cleanup.
