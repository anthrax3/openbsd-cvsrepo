1.1
log
@Welcome syspatch(8), a binary patch management utility for the base system.

This is currently a POC, maybe it will become something, maybe not.
Therefore it will not be hooked to the build before we are happy with it.

Workflow would be something like:
- fetch and verify signed tarballs containing the patched binaries from a mirror
- create a rollback tarball of the files we are about to replace
- extract and install the patched files

*** BIG FAT RED DISCLAIMER ***
This is very much WIP, it does *NOT* work, don't bikeshed, don't use it!
