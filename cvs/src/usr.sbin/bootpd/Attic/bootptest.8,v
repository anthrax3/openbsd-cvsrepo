.Nd send BOOTP queries and print responses
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm bootptest
.Op Fl f Ar bootfile
.Op Fl h
.Op Fl m Ar magic_number
.Ar server-name
.Op Ar template-file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
sends BOOTP requests to the host specified as
.Ar server-name
at one-second intervals until either a response is received,
or until ten requests have gone unanswered.
After a response is received,
.Nm
will wait one more second listening for additional responses.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl f Ar bootfile
Fill in the boot file field of the request with
.Ar bootfile .
.It Fl h
Use the hardware (Ethernet) address to identify the client.
By default, the IP address is copied into the request
indicating that this client already knows its IP address.
.It Fl m Ar magic_number
Initialize the first word of the vendor options field with
.Ar magic_number .
.El
.Pp
A
.Ar template-file
may be specified, in which case
.Nm
uses the (binary) contents of this file to initialize the
.Fa options
area of the request packet.
.Sh CREDITS
The bootptest program is a combination of original and derived works.
The main program module (bootptest.c) is original work by
.An Gordon W. Ross Aq gwr@@mc.com .
The packet printing module (print-bootp.c) is a slightly modified
version of a file from the BSD tcpdump program.
.Pp
This program includes software developed by the University of
California, Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory and its contributors.

@Change all option list specifications to ".Bl -tag -width Ds". Most man
pages just needed their -width parameter tweaked to "Ds", which provides
a nice width of 6 constant characters. For consistency more than anything.

@The proper order of the ``introductory'' macros in a man page is .Dd/.Dt/.Os.
Out of the approximately 1450 man pages, only about 90 of them were wrong.
Thanks to kwesterback@@home.com for coming up with a script and patch to repair
this. The patch also inserted a .Os macro in the few man pages that were
missing one.
