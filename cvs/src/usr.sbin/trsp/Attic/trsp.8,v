.Sh NAME
.Nm trsp
.Nd transliterate sequenced packet protocol trace
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm trsp
.Op Fl a
.Op Fl j
.Op Fl p Ar hex-address
.Op Fl s
.Op Fl t
.Op Fl z
.Op Fl N Ar system
.Op Fl M Ar core
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
interrogates the buffer of
.Tn SPP
trace records created
when a socket is marked for
.Dq debugging
(see
.Xr setsockopt 2 ) ,
and prints a readable description of these records.
When no options are supplied,
.Nm
prints all the trace records found in the system
grouped according to
.Tn SPP
connection protocol control
block
.Pq Tn PCB .
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a
In addition to the normal output,
print the values of the source and destination
addresses for each packet recorded.
.It Fl j
Just give a list of the protocol control block
addresses for which there are trace records.
.It Fl p
Show only trace records associated with the protocol
control block at the given address
.Ar hex-address .
.It Fl s
In addition to the normal output,
print a detailed description of the packet
sequencing information.
.It Fl t
In addition to the normal output,
print the values for all timers at each
point in the trace.
.It Fl z
Clear the in-kernel debugging buffers.
.It Fl M Ar core
Extract values associated with the name list from
.Pa core
instead of the running kernel.
.It Fl N Ar system
Extract the name list from
.Pa system
instead of the running kernel.
.El
.Pp
The recommended use of
.Nm
is as follows.
Isolate the problem and enable debugging on the
socket(s) involved in the connection.
Find the address of the protocol control blocks
associated with the sockets using the
.Fl A
option to
.Xr netstat 1 .
Then run
.Nm
with the
.Fl p
option, supplying the associated
protocol control block addresses.
If there are many sockets using the debugging option, the
.Fl j
option may be useful in checking to see if
any trace records are present for the socket in
question.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr netstat 1 ,
.Xr setsockopt 2 ,
.Xr trpt 8
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Sy no namelist
When the system image doesn't
contain the proper symbols to find the trace buffer;
others which should be self explanatory.
.El
.Sh BUGS
Should also print the data for each input or output,
but this is not saved in the trace record.
.Pp
The output format is inscrutable and should be described
here.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command appeared in
.Bx 4.3 .
