1.1
log
@ypldap -- Intended to be a drop-in replacement for ypserv, gluing in a
LDAP directory and thus providing support for users and groups stored in
LDAP for the get{pw,gr}ent family of functions.

As of now it relies on external LDAP libraries, choose the one of your
liking though openldap would do fine. Not linked to the builds until
some things are sorted out, having our own LDAP client code for
instance, better support for group membership lookup as well.

Remember to sync with the latest master.passwd and group files as well
to have the _ypldap user available, which is needed.
