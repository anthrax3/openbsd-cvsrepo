@Better error messages: pwarnx function, which works like pwarn, except
it shows a current package name along with the program name, e.g.,
pkg_add(foo-3.0): some error occurred.

A few messages now bear redundant pkgnames, which is much better than
doing pkg_add * and being informed that something went slightly wrong
somewhere...
