# (Original from FreeBSD)

This is the pkg_install suite of tools for doing maintenance of
software "packages".  More documentation is available in the man pages
for each individual command.

This code was written by Jordan Hubbard for FreeBSD, snatched and
mildly reshaped by John Kohl in NetBSD and the changes taken back into
FreeBSD again by Jordan, who then proceeded to add another couple
of dozen features on top.  Whee! :-)

In another round of enhancements, NetBSD changes were added by
Alistair Crooks, Hubert Feyrer and Thorsten Frueauf.   These changes
were incorporated into this version of the pkg tools in October, 1998.

Marc Espie has made further changes/improvements since then.

@updated pkg_* tools.  Merged in many changes/improvements from NetBSD.
New features include md5 hash so pkg_delete won't remove files that have
changed and the ability to define conflicting packages, e.g. you can't
install both mh and nmh.  The ports tree will have to be updated to take
advantage of this.

Let me know of any problems, real or imagined :-)
