@Import makefs - a tool to create filesystem images from a directory.

This is a rough port of the NetBSD tool with some features removed we
don't need. It compiles, but I don't promise anything more. Importing
now, so we can hack on it in tree.

The supported filesystem types are: cd9660, ffs and msdosfs.
