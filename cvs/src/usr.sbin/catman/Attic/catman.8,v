sections to be checked.
For example, if

.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl k
Ignore errors from
.Xr nroff 1
when building man pages.
.It Fl n
Do not create the
.Xr whatis 1
database.
.It Fl p

execute them.
.It Fl s
Perform work silently; do not echo commands as they are executed.
This flag is ignored if
.Fl p

.It Fl w
Only create the
.Xr whatis 1
database.

@Change all option list specifications to ".Bl -tag -width Ds". Most man
pages just needed their -width parameter tweaked to "Ds", which provides
a nice width of 6 constant characters. For consistency more than anything.
