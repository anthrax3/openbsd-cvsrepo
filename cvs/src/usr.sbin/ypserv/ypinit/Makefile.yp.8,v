@change Xrs from now-defunct db(3) to dbopen(3); this wasn;t a
straight replace: thanks both to schwarze and maja for feedback
on how to rewrite parts;

i've snuck in an rcs id->openbsd id change in dev_mkdb too;

.Dt MAKEFILE.YP 8
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm Makefile.yp
.Nd generate and distribute YP maps
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Li cd /var/yp; make
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility generates or updates the YP maps to be served by
.Xr ypserv 8 .
.Pp
Each YP domain to be served must have its own subdirectory below
.Pa /var/yp .
Use
.Xr ypinit 8
to set up such subdirectories.
In particular,
.Xr ypinit 8
will copy
.Pa /var/yp/Makefile.yp
into each new domain subdirectory.
For common configuration changes affecting all future domains, edit
.Pa /var/yp/Makefile.yp
before running
.Xr ypinit 8 .
For configuration changes affecting only one individual domain, edit the
.Pa Makefile
in the respective domain subdirectory after running
.Xr ypinit 8 .
Do
.Em not
edit
.Pa /var/yp/Makefile.yp.dist .
.Pp
By default, input data for generating YP maps is collected from the
.Pa /etc
directory.
Edit the
.Dv DIR
variable to choose a different source directory.
.Pp
To regenerate all maps for all domains, run
.Xr make 1
in
.Pa /var/yp .
To regenerate all maps for one single domain, run
.Xr make 1
in the respective domain subdirectory.
The
.Xr makedbm 8
utility will be used to create the maps in Berkeley DB format,
and they will be stored inside the appropriate domain subdirectory.
.Pp
Whenever a YP map has been updated, it is automatically distributed to all
slave servers in the respective domain using the
.Xr yppush 8
utility.
To disable automatic distribution, set the
.Dv NOPUSH
variable to an arbitrary, non-empty, value.
.Sh STANDARD YP MAPS
By default,
.Nm
provides the following
.Xr make 1
targets:
.Bl -tag -width protocols
.It Ic passwd
Generates the
.Pa passwd.byname ,
.Pa passwd.byuid ,
.Pa master.passwd.byname ,
and
.Pa master.passwd.byuid
maps from
.Xr master.passwd 5
for use by
.Xr getpwent 3 .
.Pp
The
.Pa master.passwd.*\&
maps always contain complete records in
.Xr master.passwd 5
format, including the encrypted passwords.
.Pp
The
.Pa passwd.*\&
maps follow the reduced
.Xr passwd 5
format having the class, change, and expire fields removed but by default
the encrypted passwords are included too.
If the
.Dv UNSECURE
variable is changed to be empty, the encrypted passwords are replaced by
asterisks
.Pq Ql \&* .
This
.Dq secure
mode is compatible with
.Ox
and
.Fx
clients.
.Pp
The
.Dv MINUID
and
.Dv MAXUID
variables restrict the range of user IDs included into the four passwd maps.
By default, system users are not included.
.It Ic netgroup
Generates the
.Pa netgroup ,
.Pa netgroup.byuser ,
and
.Pa netgroup.byhost
maps from
.Xr netgroup 5
for use by
.Xr getnetgrent 3
and
.Xr passwd 5 .
Requires the
.Xr revnetgroup 8
utility.
.It Ic group
Generates the
.Pa group.byname
and
.Pa group.bygid
maps from
.Xr group 5
for use by
.Xr getgrent 3 .
.Pp
The
.Dv MINGID
and
.Dv MAXGID
variables restrict the range of group IDs included into both group maps.
By default, system groups are not included.
.It Ic netid
Generates the
.Pa netid.byname
map from
.Xr netid 5 ,
.Xr passwd 5 ,
.Xr group 5 ,
and
.Xr hosts 5
for use by
.Xr getgrouplist 3 .
Falls back to
.Xr master.passwd 5
in case
.Xr passwd 5
is not available.
Requires the
.Xr mknetid 8
utility.
.It Ic hosts
Generates the
.Pa hosts.byname
and
.Pa hosts.byaddr
maps from
.Xr hosts 5
for use by
.Xr gethostbyname 3 .
.Pp
To get
.Xr ypserv 8
to ask DNS for unknown hosts, set the
.Dv USEDNS
variable to
.Fl b .
.It Ic ethers
Generates the
.Pa ethers.byaddr
and
.Pa ethers.byname
maps from
.Xr ethers 5
for use by
.Xr ethers 3 .
.It Ic networks
Generates the
.Pa networks.byname
and
.Pa networks.byaddr
maps from
.Xr networks 5
for use by
.Xr getnetent 3 .
.It Ic rpc
Generates the
.Pa rpc.bynumber
map from
.Xr rpc 5
for use by
.Xr getrpcent 3 .
.It Ic services
Generates the
.Pa services.byname
map from
.Xr services 5
for use by
.Xr getservent 3 .
.It Ic protocols
Generates the
.Pa protocols.byname
and
.Pa protocols.bynumber
maps from
.Xr protocols 5
for use by
.Xr getprotoent 3 .
.It Ic aliases
Generates the
.Pa mail.aliases
and
.Pa mail.byaddr
maps from
.Xr aliases 5 .
This target uses both
.Xr sendmail 8
with the option
.Fl bi
and the
.Xr mkalias 8
utility.
.It Ic amd.home
Generates the
.Pa amd.home
map from the file
.Pa /etc/amd/amd.home .
.It Ic all
Generates all of the above, and sends a hangup signal to
.Xr ypserv 8
such that it uses the new maps.
.El
.Pp
In order to keep additional custom YP maps up to date, the
.Pa Makefile
should be extended to support additional targets.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width "/var/yp/domainname/ypservers.db" -compact
.It /var/yp/Makefile
Top level YP Makefile.
.It /var/yp/ Ns Ar domainname Ns /Makefile
Per domain YP maps Makefile.
.It /var/yp/ Ns Ar domainname Ns /ypservers.db
Database of hosts serving this domain.
.It /var/yp/ Ns Ar domainname/mapname Ns .db
Database files containing the YP maps.
.It /var/yp/ Ns Ar domainname/target Ns .time
Cookies controlling the operation of
.Xr make 1 .
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr make 1 ,
.Xr dbopen 3 ,
.Xr makedbm 8 ,
.Xr yp 8 ,
.Xr ypinit 8 ,
.Xr yppush 8 ,
.Xr ypserv 8
.Sh BUGS
When
.Dv NOPUSH
is set and individual maps are regenerated (as opposed to
.Ic all ) ,
the hangup signal to
.Xr ypserv 8
must be sent manually, or the new maps won't be used.
.Pp
When
.Dv NOPUSH
is unset, maps are pushed to the master server on the local host too,
slowing down
.Nm .

@Make ypserv(8) reread its YP maps on SIGHUP
and use that in Makefile.yp(8) at the end of   cd /var/yp; make all
such that the new maps get used locally even when NOPUSH is set;
fixing a quirk reported by ian@@.

While here, polish the yppush(8) manual
and document a few related mini-bugs to be fixed later.

@Make use of the new mknetid(8) -P flag.

Actually, i just realized this is *required* in case you are using
a non-standard DIR without a passwd(5) file, so i'm committing this
simple change right away.
