.Sh NAME
.Nm ypserv.acl
.Nd ypserv(8) configuration file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
file controls which hosts can connect to the
.Nm YP
server.
.Pp
The format is more complex than the format for
.Xr securenet 5 .
The first two words on each line controls if the line will
.Nm allow
or
.Nm deny
access for a
.Nm host ,
network
.Nm (net)
or
.Nm all
hosts.
.Pp
The
.Nm YP
server reads the configuration file and builds a list in memory.
This list is processed from the beginning for every incoming request.
As soon as a
match is found in the list the search terminates and it returns success
or failure depending on which of
.Nm allow
or
.Nm deny
was specified.
If no match was found in the list success is returned.
.Pp
If access is denied every call will cause a
.Nm no such domain
error for the caller.
.Pp
Normally both the local hostname and localhost must be
allowed access.
Otherwise
.Nm ypserv
might not work correctly.
.Pp
There is no default name for this file.
Start
.Nm ypserv
with
.Fl a Ar filename
to read a file with this format.
.Pp
The following syntax may be used:
.Pp
<
.Ic allow|deny
>
.Ic host
<
.Ic hostname|ip-address
>
.Pp
If
.Ic hostname
has more than one IP address, they will all be added to the list.
.Pp
<
.Ic allow|deny
>
.Ic net
<
.Ic netname|netnumber
>
.Op Ic netmask <netname|netnumber>
.Pp
If the
.Ic netmask
part of the command isn't given then the netmask will be assumed to be a
class A, B or C net depending on the net number.
.Pp
<
.Ic allow|deny
>
.Ic all
.Pp
A line containing one of these commands will always match any host.

.Sh EXAMPLES
A configuration file might look like the following:
.Bd -literal
# This is an example of an access control file to be used by ypserv.
#
# This file is parsed line by line. First match will terminate the check
# of the caller.
#

###########################################################################
# This is the commands that will match a single host
#
#	allow host <hostname|ip-address>
#	deny host <hostname|ip-address>
#
# To process hostname gethostbyname is called. If the hostname has
# multiple ip-addresses all will be added (I hope). ip-address
# processed by inet_aton.
allow host localhost
allow host myypserver
deny host jodie

###########################################################################
# This is the commands that will match a network
#
#	allow net <netname|netnumber> [netmask <netname|netnumber>]
#	deny net <netname|netnumber> [netmask <netname|netnumber>]
#
# To process netname getnetbyname is called, and inet_aton is used for
# netnumber. inet_aton both access numbers as 255.255.255.0 and 0xffffff00.
#
# If netmask isn't given the parser will assume netmask from the first bits
# of the network number. So if the network is subneted the you have to add
# the netmask. In my case I've got the network 139.58.253.0 at home so to
# allow any of my computers to talk with the server I need the following
# line
#
allow net mojathome netmask 255.255.255.0

###########################################################################
# At last we have a command that will match any caller:
#
#	allow all
#	deny all
#

# reject all connections
deny all

@- remove all trailing whitespace

- fix remaining .Nm usage as well
- this is from a patch I received from kwesterback@@home.com, who has been
  working on some scripts for fixing formatting errors in mdoc'd man pages

Ok, so there could be a cost/benefit debate with this commit, but since I have
the patch we might as well commit it...

@When using /var/yp/securenet the local host running ypserv wasn't garanteed
access to ypserv. This has been fixed by always allowing the host 127.0.0.1
access when using /var/yp/securenet. This to keep compability with SunOS.

When using the ypserv.acl(5) format access must be granted to 127.0.0.1 in
the file. This to make it possible to disallow access to ypserv from the
host running it. This has been documented in man page and example.

Thanks to <Ulrich.Flegel@@braunschweig.netsurf.de> for bringing this to
my attention (again). -moj
