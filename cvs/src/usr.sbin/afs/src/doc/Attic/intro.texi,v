@@section What is Arla?

Arla is a free AFS implementation. Some of the goals are:

@@itemize @@bullet
@@item
to have an implementation that is free and can be used for adding and
playing with cool stuff, like support for disconnected-mode. Implement
features you can't get from commercial AFS.
@@item
to provide an alternative to Transarc's and OpenAFS AFS-clients and
server implementations.
@@item
to add support for platfroms that don't have AFS support from Transarc
or OpenAFS today.
@@end itemize

This release is known to work on the following platforms: NetBSD,
OpenBSD, FreeBSD, Linux, Solaris, Darwin/MacOS X.

Earlier releases are known to work on current or earlier versions of the
following platforms: SunOS, AIX, IRIX, Digital UNIX. Some fixes might
be necessary to make Arla work.

There is or has been done work to support the following platforms: HPUX,
Fujitsu UXP/V. Some development is necessary to make Arla work.

There is work going on to support the following platform: Windows
NT/2000. Contributions are very welcome.

@@section Status

Arla has the following features (quality varies between
stable and not implemented):

@@itemize @@bullet
@@item
a rxgen implementation called ydr (stable).
@@item
a cache manager replacing Transarc's afsd. The cache managers
quality depends on platform: *BSD, Linux i386 and Solaris are stable, 
others platforms are not as tested ane therefore not as stable.
@@item
partly implemented fs, vos, pts commands. Commands typically issued
by users are stable, commands issued by administrators may return
unmotivated errors or are not implemented yet.
@@item
an implementaion of rxkad written outside USA without any export 
restrictions (stable).
@@item
a server implementation called milko, containing file server, 
volume server and protection server. The file server has an
API to the storage backend(s). Milko is still unstable and
not fit for production yet.
