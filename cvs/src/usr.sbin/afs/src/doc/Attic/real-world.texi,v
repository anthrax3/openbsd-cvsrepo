And if the client doesn't transmit any traffic to a particular host

then the server will just figure out it has a new client, right?

Wrong, the rx-connection is cached on the connection id, not the
host/port pair. This is right, but the connection is never updated in
the original rx-code. This have the unfortunate effect that the server
keep talking to the old client.

The major problem with getting AFS to exported read-write to SMB

the smb-server. The simple may is to use clear-text password between the
samba-server and the client, and then get tokens for the user with this

that are security aware.

Kerberos 4 and 5 can be integrated quite well with AFS. This is many due
to that the security model used in AFS is in fact Keberos. The kaserver
is a Kerberos 4 server with pre-authentication. Kaserver also provides a
feature that you can only try a password N times, and after that you are
locked out for half-an-hour. This feature require that
pre-authentication is used, but since the ka-server provides a Kerberos
4 interface (that doesn't use pre-authentication) is mostly worthless.

Many sites indeed uses a kerberosserver instead of a kaserver. One of
the resons are that they want to use Kerberos 5 (with for example
Windows 2000).

If the client doesn't transmit any traffic to a particular host for that
amount of time, it will get mapped to one of the IP address of the
NAT-server (if you happen to run PAT, the port will be randomized too).

The authors of Rx realized that keeping a Rx connection associated with
(IP-address,port) pair was a bad idea. One example is that you get
problems with multi-homed hosts. So Rx keeps its own connection id data in
the packet. With this feature client and server should be able to detect
address changes.

Unfortunately, the use of the orignal Rx-code stops this from happening
in Transarc/OpenAFS code. The code keeps track of incoming packets and
keeps track of the right peer (client). But it never updates the
IP-address,port pair in its data structure, so the answer packet will go
to the old IP-address,port pair.

If you can control your NAT machine you can have static mapping for
your AFS hosts. Transarc/OpenAFS and Arla uses source port 7001 (Arla
older then 0.36 uses source port 4711). You can also try to use
Natkeep @@url{http://mit.edu/zacheiss/www/natkeep/} if you run an old
Arla or Transarc/OpenAFS client. Arla 0.36 and later have support for
polling the servers at the right interval to prevent NAT from dropping
information about your session.

Kerberos 4 and 5 can be integrated quite well with AFS. This is mainly
due to the fact that the security model used in AFS is Kerberos. The
kaserver is a Kerberos 4 server with pre-authentication. The kaserver
also provides a feature that limits the number of password retries, and
after that you are locked out for half an hour. This feature can only be
used in the ka interface as it requires pre-authentication, but since
the kaserver provides a Kerberos 4 interface (without pre-authentication
and without this limitation) it is quite worthless.

Many sites indeed use a kerberosserver instead of a kaserver. One of
the reasons is that they want to use Kerberos 5 (which is required
for Windows 2000).

To use a kerberosserver, you have to put the same key into the AFS
KeyFile and the principal named afs of your kerberos realm. If you have
a cell which has another name than lowercase of your realmname, the
instance is the cellname. As the cellname often contains dots, this can
be quite confusing in Kerberos 4: afs.stacken.kth.se@@@@STACKEN.KTH.SE. The
first dot is the seperator between principal and instance, the other
dots are part of the name. The simplest way to do create a KeyFile on
your AFS server is to use heimdal's kadmin to generate and extract a
KeyFile. It has an option designed to do so. Be aware that the serial
number of the afs principal must match on all kerberos servers and
all KeyFiles on all AFS servers.

The default cellname to get a kerberos ticket for is contained in the
configuration file @@file{ThisCell}. If you got more than one cell, you
want to list all cells to get tickets for in the @@file{TheseCells} file.

To further confuse the poor user, AFS and Kerberos programmers decided
that they wanted to store their credentials at different places. In AFS,
the kernel was a natural place to store the credentials (named token)
since the CMU/Transarc AFS/OpenAFS implementation lives in the
kernel. The Kerberos people on the other hand thought that storing the
credentials (named ticket) in a file would be a good idea.

So know you have to synchronize the credentials if you just want to
enter your password once. There are several tools that can do that for
you. The question is what tools to use for what problem.

To add to the confusion not all tools talk to both Kerberos and
kaservers. There is also a bogus user-id in the token that is supposed
to be the same as your pts-user-id. Not that it makes any difference,
but some people get confused when unknown numbers show up in the token.
The easily confused people are often the ones that have more than one
principal in the same realm/cell (read sysadmins).

If you want to get your ticket from your Kerberos server, you use
@@code{kinit}, and then use @@code{afslog} or @@code{aklog} to get AFS
tokens and push them to the kernel (and AFS daemon). Some @@code{kinit}
(and @@code{kauth}) can do both for you, use @@code{kinit --afslog} or
simply @@code{kauth}. Note that @@code{kinit} and @@code{kauth} don't
get set your AFS-token user-id right, and thus can be confusing
for people who think that this is important.

The @@code{klog} program that you get with Transarc/OpenAFS talks to the
kaserver and behaves just-right in the sense that it talks to the pts
server to get the AFS-token user-id right, but @@code{klog} talks only to
the kaserver which will not work for people with a Kerberos server.
@@code{Klog} in Arla was written by Chris Wing
@@email{wingc@@@@engin.umich.edu} as a part of a packet called
@@code{afsutils}, they did the right thing and talked to the pts-server
to get the user-id. However, it uses Kerberos libs to talk to the
server. These libraries require the files @@file{/etc/krb.conf} and
@@file{/etc/krb.realms} to be setup correctly for their cell/realm. Not
that easy.

A long time ago Ken Hornstein @@email{kenh@@@@cmf.nrl.navy.mil} wrote the
AFS Migration Kit that helped you to migrate from AFS to MIT Kerberos 5.
It included a tool named aklog that could convert a Kerberos tickets to
tokens. This tool was also rewritten in Arla by Brandon S. Allbery
@@email{allbery@@@@ece.cmu.edu}. @@code{aklog} can't get you new
credentials, it just converts old ones to new ones.

Then Transarc decided that they needed to fix a security hole in their
kaserver, and while doing that, they managed to break a part in the 
kaserver so it ceased to work for kerberos requests. 

First the defect existed unnoticed for a long time, later Transarc has
not managed to distribute a working version of the kaserver. Due to this,
a lot of sites run a kaserver with this defect. Instead of installing
working authentification servers from another sources, people started to
whine again and Love @@email{lha@@@@stacken.kth.se} wrote the tool
@@code{kalog} that talked the ka-protocol (but didn't do the AFS user-id
right) to work around that problem.

All tools that use Kerberos 4 need a working @@file{/etc/krb.conf} and
@@file{/etc/krb.realms}. Kerberos 5 programs need @@file{/etc/krb5.conf}.
AFS aware tools need @@file{/usr/arla/etc/CellServDB} or
@@file{/usr/vice/etc/CellServDB}.

Also the Kerberos implementations from KTH (kth-krb and Heimdal) include
AFS support to make your life more pleasant. One thing is that you can
have a file @@file{$HOME/.TheseCells} that lists the cells you use and the
Kerberos tools will try to get tickes and tokens for those cells.
Heimdal contains support for converting a Kerberos 4 srvtab to an AFS
KeyFile.

Below is a table that describes what tools does what, what
inheritance(s) they have, and what protocol(s) they speak. From the
inheritance (also in a table below) it is possible to deduct what
configuration files the tools use.
