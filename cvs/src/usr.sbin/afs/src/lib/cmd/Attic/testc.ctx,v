%name description

	command to manipulate the filesystem

%name os

	"Arla, KTH"

%name section

	1

%command setacl

	Set the ACL for the named directory
	.Ar dir
	to the list of
	.Ar acl
	entries. If the flag
	.Fl clear
	is specified all current ACL entries are removed before the
	new one is added. You must have the A-ACL on the directory to
	be able to change the ACL.

	The ACL entry consist of two parts, a user/group and
	rights. The rights are rwlidka.
	.Bl -tag -width "Administer"
	.It Em Read
	the user/group can read files in this directory.
	.It Em Write
	the user/group can write files in this directory.
	.It Em List
	the user/group can list files in this directory, they
	can also read symlinks.
	.It Em Insert
	the user/group can create new files in this directory.
	.It Em Delete
	the user/group can delete files from this directory.
	.It Em locK
	the user/group can do locking on files in this directory.
	.It Em Administer
	the user/group can change the acl and the modebits in this directory
	.El
	.Pp
	There is also some named ACL that is easier to remember. Those are
	.Ar all,
	.Ar read,
	.Ar write,
	.Ar none,
	.Ar mail.
	All of these are quote obvoius what they do execpt the last
	one, and you shouldn't use that one.
	.Pp
	There are three special groups that is good know know about:
	.Bl -tag -width "Administer"
	.It Em system:anyuser
	any user of the AFS system	
	.It Em system:auth-user
	any user the is authenticated to the cell that this directory exists.
	Use
	.Ic fs whatcell
	to figure out what cell it is. 
	.It Em system:administrators
	this is system-administrators of the cell. They can't read
	files without with, but since the always can change the ACL
	they can add them-self. You should trust them the are nice guys.
	.El
	.Pp
	Groups and (remote)users can be created with
	.Xr pts(1).

	.Pp
	Examples:
	.Pp
	.Nm fs setacl
	\&. lha all
	.Pp
	.Nm fs setacl
	\&. system:anyuser none

%command listacl

	List the ACL for the directory
	.Ar dir
	(or if its isn't specifed 
	.Pa .
	will be used).
