@@cindex life-cycle of a Problem Report
@@cindex states of Problem Reports
@@cindex Problem Report states
@@cindex automatic notification

Each PR goes through a defined series of states between origination and
closure.  The originator of a PR receives notification automatically of
any state changes.

Unless your site has customized states (see @@pxref{states
file,,,gnats}), @@sc{gnats} uses these states:

@@table @@dfn
@@cindex @@emph{open} state
@@cindex initial state (@@dfn{open})
@@cindex state---@@dfn{open}
@@item open
The initial state of a Problem Report.  This means the PR has been filed
and the responsible person(s) notified.

@@cindex @@emph{analyzed} state
@@cindex state---@@dfn{analyzed}
@@item analyzed
The responsible person has analyzed the problem.  The analysis should
contain a preliminary evaluation of the problem and an estimate of the
amount of time and resources necessary to solve the problem.  It should
also suggest possible workarounds.

@@cindex @@emph{feedback} state
@@cindex state---@@dfn{feedback}
@@item feedback
The problem has been solved, and the originator has been given a patch
or other fix.  The PR remains in this state until the originator
acknowledges that the solution works.

@@cindex @@emph{closed} state
@@cindex state---@@dfn{closed}
@@cindex final state (@@dfn{closed})
@@item closed
A Problem Report is closed (``the bug stops here'') only when any
changes have been integrated, documented, and tested, and the submitter
has confirmed the solution.

@@cindex @@emph{suspended} state
@@cindex state---@@dfn{suspended}
@@item suspended
Work on the problem has been postponed.  This happens if a timely
solution is not possible or is not cost-effective at the present time.
The PR continues to exist, though a solution is not being actively
sought.  If the problem cannot be solved at all, it should be closed
rather than suspended.
