Subject: returning to TR-20916 (Rx redistributability)

Dear Derrick:

Back in March, I opened report TR-20916 in response to your question
about whether it was true that Rx is freely redistributable, as
represented to you by Jim Doyle of Boston University.  I apologize
that there has been such a long delay in any further action, but I'd
like to work now on resolving it.  Mike Kazar has confirmed for me
that he made parts of Rx freely redistributable with Alfred Spector's
approval, so I don't anticipate a problem, but I'd like to clear
things with our licensing/contracts dept too.  As a first step, can
you please send me a copy of the copyright from the header that Jim
mentions?

  From what I understand, Rx was developed at CMU as part of a DARPA
  funded research project jointly funded by IBM.  Rx was picked up by
  the AFS group and then used.. So, by all rights, the Rx stack is in
  the public domain because the DARPA funding requirement placed it
  there... You can read the copyright in the header for the full
  legalese.

With this in hand, I'll be in a better position to answer our
Licensing guy's questions.

Thank you.

Tony Mauro
