.Dd July 7, 1999
.Dt KLOG 1
.Os "The Arla Project"
.Sh NAME
.Nm klog
.Nd
A program to get AFS tokens and possibly other things
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl principal Ar Kerberos principal
.Op Fl cell Ar AFS cell
.Op Fl lifetime Ar token lifetime in hrs:min:sec
.Op Fl tmp
.Op Fl setpag
.Op Fl pipe
.Op Fl password Ar Kerberos password
.Op Fl realm Ar Kerberos realm (optional)
.Op Fl servers Ar AFS kaservers to contact
.Op Fl silent
.Op Fl timeout Ar network timeout
.Op Fl help
.Op Ar user@@cell
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command obtains AFS tokens and possibly a Kerberos ticket granting ticket
as well. By default it only gets an AFS token for the named principal and
cell.
.Pp
This command can be invoked more than once to acquire AFS tokens in
multiple cells. There is no way at present to write Kerberos TGTs for
different realms into the same ticket file.
.Pp
If
.Nm
is successful in getting a token and you already have a token for the same
cell in your current PAG, it will be overwritten by the new token. An
existing token will not be erased if a new token cannot be acquired.
.Pp
You can specify part or whole of a Kerberos principal on the command line;
for instance:
.Pp
.Nm
username
.Pp
or
.Nm
username@@cell.name
.Pp
or just
.Nm
@@cell.name
.Pp
If neither is specified, the default is your current user name and the
local AFS cell.
.Pp
The following flags are supported:
.Bl -tag -width xxxx
.It Fl principal
Principal to get tokens for. If not specified,
.Nm
tries to use your user name, which is guessed from $USER or from the UID
that
.Nm
is run as.
.It Fl lifetime
Lifetime for the Kerberos TGT and/or AFS token. This can be specified as:
.Pp
.Nm
.Fl lifetime hours
.Pp
or
.Nm
.Fl lifetime hours:minutes
.Pp
or
.Nm
.Fl lifetime hours:minutes:seconds
.Pp
If this option is not specified, the default lifetime of 720 hours (30
days) is used; however, the administrators of your cell may have chosen a
lesser maximum lifetime.
.Pp
Please note that in Kerberos 4, only 255 discrete lifetimes are possible
spanning the range from 5 minutes to 30 days. The lifetime that you
specify will be rounded up to the next possible lifetime.
.It Fl cell
AFS cell to get tokens for. If not specified,
.Nm
guesses your local cell.
.It Fl password
You can specify the Kerberos password on the command line. This is a
really, really, really, bad idea on most systems out there, since any user
can use the \fBps\fP command to examine the command line of any running
process.
.Pp
You should not use this option.
.It Fl realm
Most AFS cells are set up in such a way that the Kerberos realm name is
the same as the cell name (except in upper case). If the name of your AFS
cell differs from your Kerberos realm, however,
.Nm
may not be able to automatically fetch your tokens without specifying the
correct realm name with this option.
.It Fl servers
You can list one or more kaservers to contact directly here.
.Nm
will attempt to contact each of them until it finds one that works.
.It Fl timeout
You can specify the number of seconds that
.Nm
will wait for a network operation to complete. (there are 3 network
operations performed by
.Nm
- the AFS ID is looked up from the dbserver, the Kerberos 4 TGT must be
obtained, and the AFS token must be fetched.
.Pp
If you do not use this option,
.Nm
will wait forever if necessary.
.Pp
.It Fl silent
This causes
.Nm
not to write to the standard error channel. By default, error messages are
sent to stderr.
.It Fl pipe
If this flag is given, then
.Nm
will not write to the standard output, and will only accept a password
written to the standard input. Error messages will still be printed to
standard error unless the \fB-silent\fP option is also specified.
.Pp
Because it does not attempt to verify that the TTY is safe, this should
only be used from scripts.
.It Fl setpag
Stores the AFS token in a new PAG, and then
\fBexec()\fPs a shell. The environment variable KRBTKFILE is set to point
to a unique name in /ticket, so that the Kerberos TGT gathered (if any) is
written to a safe place.  The shell is chosen via \fBgetpwnam()\fP called
with the principal's name; if that fails, then \fBgetpwuid()\fP is tried
with your current UID; if this fails, 
.Nm
attempts to execute /bin/sh.
.It Fl tmp
Actually get a Kerberos TGT and writes it to /tmp (or the file specified
in the KRBTKFILE environment variable). By default, only an AFS token is
acquired.
.Pp
This is a poor choice of name, as in reality writing Kerberos tickets to
/tmp is a bad idea and often a security risk. This name is only here for
compatibility with other AFS implementations. (\fB-tgt\fP would have been
a better choice of name)
.Pp
.It Fl help
Prints out a help message.
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Nm
returns with exit status 0 (true) if and only if a Kerberos 4 TGT was
successfully acquired and an AFS token was successfully stored. In all
other cases, the return value is non-zero.
.Pp
It is possible to call
.Nm
from scripts or other programs for automated authentication with the
.Fl pipe
option, although discretion and caution is advised when doing
so.
.Sh NOTES
By default,
.Nm
tries to look up your Kerberos principal in the kaserver's database to
figure out the proper AFSId to use. As far as I know, this only affects
the output of the \fBtokens\fP program.
.Pp
The minimum token lifetime is 5 minutes.

.Sh BUGS
The
.Fl servers
option only affects where the AFS ID is looked up, not
which servers are actually contacted to get the TGT or token.
.Pp
.Nm
should automatically deal with the case where the Kerberos realm is not
the same as the AFS cell name.
