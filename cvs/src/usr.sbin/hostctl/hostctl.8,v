.Dt HOSTCTL 8
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm hostctl
.Nd display or modify contents of the host's key-value store
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl qt
.Op Fl f Ar device
.Op Fl i Ar input
.Op Fl o Ar output
.Ar key
.Op Ar value
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
program provides a generic interface for accessing key-value stores on
the system's host.
It is primarily used for an abstracted way to exchange information
with hypervisors that are supported by the
.Xr pvbus 4
subsystem.
When given the name of a specific
.Ar key ,
.Nm
will display the value or list the key names of the subtree.
If the key is followed by a
.Ar value ,
.Nm
will write the new key-value pair to the key-value store.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl f Ar device
Use
.Ar device
instead of the default
.Pa /dev/pvbus0 .
.It Fl i Ar input
Read the new value for the specified
.Ar key
from the
.Ar input
file.
.It Fl o Ar output
Save the returned value in the
.Ar output
file.
.It Fl q
Don't ask for confirmation of any default options.
.It Fl t
Print the type of the underlying driver.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width "/dev/pvbusX" -compact
.It /dev/pvbus Ns Ar u
.Xr pvbus 4
device unit
.Ar u
file.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
The
.Xr vmt 4
driver provides access to the
.Dq guestinfo
information that is available in VMware virtual machines:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# hostctl guestinfo.hostname
vm-111.example.com
# hostctl guestinfo.ip 192.168.100.111
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Xr xen 4
driver provides access to the XenStore that is available in Xen
virtual machines.
The
.Xr pvbus 4
layer abstracts it as a simple key-value interface:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# hostctl device/vif/0/mac
fe:e1:ba:d0:27:0f
# hostctl device/vif/0/description "My interface"
.Ed
.Pp
The XenStore is a virtual filesystem that also provides directories.
The directory name can be specified as a key to return the contents,
other keys, of the directory:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# hostctl device
vfb
vbd
vif
console
.Ed
.Pp
Access to the Hyper-V Key-Value Pair exchange interface is provided by the
.Xr hyperv 4
driver.
The
.Xr pvbus 4
layer abstracts access to several pre-defined key pools:
.Em Auto ,
.Em Guest ,
.Em External
and
.Em Guest/Parameters .
Available keys can be listed and set:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# hostctl Auto/
FullyQualifiedDomainName
IntegrationServicesVersion
NetworkAddressIPv4
NetworkAddressIPv6
OSBuildNumber
OSName
OSMajorVersion
OSMinorVersion
OSVersion
ProcessorArchitecture
# hostctl Auto/FullyQualifiedDomainName `hostname`

1.1
log
@Add hostctl(8), a tool to access key-value stores on the host,
currently for hypervisor information stores on pvbus(4).

As discussed with deraadt@@, the generic name is used to potentially
extend it for other use cases where the host or machine firmware
provides a key-value store, hypervisors or things like openprom.

Not enabled yet.
