.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Named-xfer
is an ancillary program executed by
.IR named (8)
to perform an inbound zone transfer.  It is rarely executed directly, and
only by system administrators who are trying to debug a zone transfer problem.
See RFC's 1033, 1034, and 1035 for more information on the Internet
name-domain system.
.PP
Options are:
.TP
.B \-z
specifies the name of the zone to be transferred.
.TP
.B \-f
specifies the name of the file into which the zone should be dumped
when it is received from the primary server.
.TP
.B \-s
specifies the serial number of our current copy of this zone.  If the
\s-1SOA RR\s+1 we get from the primary server does not have a serial
number higher than this, the transfer will be aborted.
.TP
.B \-d
Print debugging information.
A number after the ``d'' determines the level of
messages printed.
.TP
.B \-l
Specifies a log file for debugging messages.  The log file will be
written in the directory specified in
.I named.boot
(which is
.IR /var/named
in the default configuration).  Note that this only applies if
.I \-d
is also specified.
.TP
.B \-t
Specifies a trace file which will contain a protocol trace of the zone
transfer.  This is probably only of interest to people debugging the name
server itself.
.TP
.B \-p
Use a different port number.  The default is the standard port number
as returned by getservbyname(3) for service ``domain''.
.TP
.B \-S
Perform a restricted transfer of only the SOA, NS records and glue A records
for the zone. The SOA record will not be loaded by named but will be used to
determine when to verify the NS records.  See the ``stubs'' directive in
.IR named (8)
for more information.
.PP
Additional arguments are taken as name server addresses in so-called
``dotted-quad'' syntax only; no host name are allowed here.  At least
one address must be specified.  Any additional addresses will be tried
in order if the first one fails to transfer to us successfully.
