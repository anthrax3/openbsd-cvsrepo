.UC 5
.SH NAME
named.reload \- cause the name server to synchronize its database
.SH DESCRIPTION
This command sends a \s-1SIGHUP\s+1 to the running name server.  This
signal is documented in
.IR named (8).
.SH BUGS
Does not check to see if the name server is actually running, and could
use a stale PID cache file which may result in the death of an unrelated
process.
.SH SEE ALSO
