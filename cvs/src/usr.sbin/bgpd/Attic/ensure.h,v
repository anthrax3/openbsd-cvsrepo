log
@welcome, bgpd
started by me some time ago with moral support from theo, the proceeded up to
the point where the session engine worked correctly. claudio jeker joined
then and did a lot of work in the RDE.
it is not particulary usefull as application right now as parts are still
missing but is imported to enable more people to work on it.
status:
BGP sessions get established fine, OPEN messages and then KEEPALIVEs
exchanged etc. session FSM works fine; NOTIFICATIONs are handled fine, and
all connection drops etc I provoked get handled fine.
Incoming UPDATE messgages are parsed well and the data entered to the RIB,
the decision process is not yet there, neither is outgoing UPDATEs or sync
to the kernel routing table.

not connected to the builds yet.
