@Switch OpenBSD/hp300 to wscons, still using on-board ROM fonts for now.

Main features:
- MI hil drivers, allowing live plug/unplug of devices, and the keyboard
  does not need to be at id 1 anymore.
- SGC bus support on 4xx models. SGC frame buffers are supported too, but
  not as console, though you can use them as a regular glass terminal if
  you run a getty on ttyC0. Currently not compiled-in, awaiting for an sti(4)
  fix to be commited.
- HP-UX compatibility interfaces are removed. grfinfo and hilinfo are removed.

X11 support is currently broken by these changes; X.org X11R6 support will
be available very soon.

Tested on hyperion and 4 different flavours of catseye/topcat/kathmandu; other,
older frame buffers (davinci, gatorbox and renaissance) could not been tested
but should work; please report any regression.

@Change all option list specifications to ".Bl -tag -width Ds". Most man
pages just needed their -width parameter tweaked to "Ds", which provides
a nice width of 6 constant characters. For consistency more than anything.
