.Sh NAME
.Nm setobjstat
.Nd set SCSI Environmental Services Device object status
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm setobjstat
.Ar device objectid stat0 stat1 stat2 stat3
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
sets the object status for a SCSI Environmental Services (or SAF-TE) device.
The
.Ar objectid
argument may be determined by running
.Xr getencstat 8 .
.Pp
The status fields are partially common (first byte only, which must
have a value of 0x80 contained in it), but otherwise quite device-specific.
A complete discussion of the possible values is impractical here.
Please refer to the ANSI SCSI specification (available on
the FTP site ftp.t10.org).
.Pp
Note that devices may simply and silently ignore the setting of these values.
