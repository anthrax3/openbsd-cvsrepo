.Sh NAME
.Nm sesd
.Nd monitor SCSI Environmental Services Devices
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm sesd
.Op Fl d
.Op Fl t Ar poll-interval
.Ar device
.Op Ar device ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
monitors SCSI Environmental Services (or SAF-TE) devices for changes
in state and logs such changes to the system error logger
(see
.Xr syslogd 8 ) .
At least one device must be specified.
When no other options are supplied,
.Nm
detaches and becomes a daemon, by default waking up every 30 seconds to
poll each device for a change in state.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl p Ar poll-interval
Change the interval of polling from the default 30 seconds to the number
of seconds specified.
.It Fl d
Instead of detaching and becoming a daemon, stay attached to the
controlling terminal and log changes there as well as via the system
logger.
.El
.Pp
The user may then use
.Xr getencstat 8
to get more detailed information about the state of the enclosure device
or objects within the enclosure device.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /dev/sesN -compact
.It Pa /dev/ses\fIN\fR

.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr ses 4 ,

.Xr setobjstat 8 ,
.Xr syslogd 8
.Sh BUGS
This is something of a toy, but it is better than nothing.
