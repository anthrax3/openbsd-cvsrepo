.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm getNAME
.Nd "get NAME sections from manual source for whatis/apropos data base"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm getNAME
.Op Fl itw
.Ar path Op Ar path ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
program looks inside manual sources to retrieve the NAME section of
the manual page.
It can be used to create a table of contents, report
the style of manual, or to create an introduction to the manual section.
By default,
.Nm
returns data for use in an
.Xr apropos 1
database.
.Nm
is designed to be called from
.Xr makewhatis 8
or other manual grovelling tools, not to be used directly.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl i
Returns information useful in creating an introduction to a manual
section.
See
.Xr intro 1 ,
.Xr intro 2 ,
etc. for examples.
.It Fl t
Returns information useful for creating a table of contents.
.It Fl w
Determines whether traditional man
.Pq Dq OLD ,
new mandoc
.Pq Dq NEW ,
or some unknown
.Pq Dq UNKNOWN
format exists.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr apropos 1 ,
.Xr man 1 ,
.Xr whatis 1 ,
.Xr makewhatis 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command first appeared in
.Bx 2.0 .
.Sh BUGS
It would be nice if
.Nm
could deal with preformatted manuals.

@- remove all trailing whitespace

- fix remaining .Nm usage as well
- this is from a patch I received from kwesterback@@home.com, who has been
  working on some scripts for fixing formatting errors in mdoc'd man pages

Ok, so there could be a cost/benefit debate with this commit, but since I have
the patch we might as well commit it...

@Changes from NetBSD (mrg):
    add a manual for getNAME.  also, change the `default' output to be in
    a form much more useful for an apropos(1) database.  this will be used
    by makewhatis(1) to generate the whatis.db file's now...

OpenBSD changes:
    use basename(3) instead of doing a half-hearted job inline.
    use strncat(3) because I am anal.
