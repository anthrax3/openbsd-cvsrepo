@On fatal errors, kill ourselves with thrkill(0,9,NULL) instead of
simply exiting, via helper functions _dl_die(), _dl_diedie(), and
_dl_oom().

@Remove dependency on __got_{start,end} symbols and look at PT_GNU_RELRO
instead.  Result in a few more pages that aren't writable on some platforms
(such as hppa).  Based on an initial diff from guenther@@.

Thanks to deraadt@@ for testing.

@Simplify the relocation code for the ld.so bootstrap and static pie: track
just the dynamic tags are needed instead of reusing the generic elf_object_t

@A first cut at ld.so bits for m88k. Lazy binding is currently disabled as it
does not work beyond the first few lazy resolver calls. But that's already
enough to run simple binaries.
