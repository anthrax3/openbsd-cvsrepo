@Makefile:
	build with ${CC} -shared like the rest of shared libraries
	do now, instead of using ${LD}.
Other files:
	make output more useful so that it is possible to tell if
	a constructor/destructor is running the correct number of times.

1.1.1.1
log
@Updated version of ld.so, contains additional functionality and fixes/
design changes required by egcs.

added support for ldconfig/ld.so.hints

changes to low level relocation code, required by egcs pic
code generation that moved global variable loads to before the
self relocation was performed. Only powerpc supported, mips code not updated.

Code cleaned up somewhat reasonably.

This code needs to be reviewed closely for significant problems 
such as correctness and security.
