@Switch ld.so's _dl_opendir functions to use a locally defined
_dl_dirdesc struct (containing just the fields ld.so's implementation
actually needs) instead of reusing libc's _dirdesc struct.

Also, switch ldconfig to use futimens() instead of futimes().

@Change ld.so search order/method to match the a.out ld.so.

run destructors on dlclose()

Move more symbols into _dl_ private space, so that the proper (libc)
version of the function will be used.

Add readdir() functionality to perform the proper library searching.

Support DL_PRELOAD

Do not relocate symbols if ld.so is being traced (and will exit).

Misc lint cleanup.
