@Fix loaded object sod matching: when we load libfoo.so.X.Y into

log
@Change ld.so search order/method to match the a.out ld.so.

run destructors on dlclose()

Move more symbols into _dl_ private space, so that the proper (libc)
version of the function will be used.

Add readdir() functionality to perform the proper library searching.

Support DL_PRELOAD

Do not relocate symbols if ld.so is being traced (and will exit).

Misc lint cleanup.
