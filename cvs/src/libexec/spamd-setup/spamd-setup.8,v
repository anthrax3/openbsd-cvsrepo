.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm spamd-setup
.Nd parse and load file of spammer addresses
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm spamd-setup
.Op Fl bDdn
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility sends blacklist data to
.Xr spamd 8 ,
as well as configuring mail rejection messages for
blacklist entries.
.Pp
When
.Nm
is run in blacklist only mode,
it also sends blacklist data to the
.Xr pf 4
table
.Pf < Ar spamd Ns > .
The
.Pf < Ar spamd Ns >
table must then be used in conjunction with a
.Xr pf 4
redirection rule to selectively redirect mail connections
to
.Xr spamd 8 .
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl b
Blacklisting only mode.
Blacklist data is normally stored only in
.Xr spamd 8 .
With this flag, data is stored in both
.Xr spamd 8
and
.Xr pf 4 .
Use this flag if
.Xr spamd 8
is running with the
.Fl b
flag too.
.It Fl D
Daemonize;
run
.Nm
in the background.
.It Fl d
Debug mode reports a few pieces of information.
.It Fl n
Dry-run mode.
No data is shipped.
.El
.Pp
Lists are specified in the configuration file
.Pa /etc/mail/spamd.conf
and are processed in the order specified in the
.Ar all
tag.
Output is concatenated and sent to a running
.Xr spamd 8 .
Addresses are sent
along with the message spamd will give on mail rejection when a
matching client connects.
The configuration port for
.Xr spamd 8
is found from
.Xr services 5 ,
by looking for the named service
.Em spamd-cfg .
.Pp
.Nm
reads all configuration information from the
.Xr spamd.conf 5
file.
.Sh FILES
.Pa /etc/mail/spamd.conf
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr pf.conf 5 ,
.Xr services 5 ,
.Xr spamd.conf 5 ,
.Xr spamd 8
.Sh BUGS
Blacklists removed from
.Pa /etc/mail/spamd.conf
are not automatically removed from the running
.Xr spamd 8 .
If an entry is removed from
.Pa /etc/mail/spamd.conf
that is currently in use, it is necessary to restart
.Xr spamd 8 .
This applies only to blacklists that are removed entirely, not those
that are simply modified.

.Sh CONFIGURATION FILES
The default configuration file is
.Pa /etc/spamd.conf
which follows the syntax of configuration databases
as documented in 
.Xr getcap 3 . 
Additional files given as parameters to
d72 4
a75 1
will be read to add to the default configuration file,
a77 129
Example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
.Ic all:\e
.Ic 	:spews1:white:myblack:\e
.Ic 	
.Ic spews1:\e
.Ic 	:black\e
.Ic 	:msg=\e"SPAM. Your address \%A is in the spews level\e
.Ic 	1 database\en see http://www.spews.org/ask.cgi?x=%A\en\e":\e
.Ic 	:method=http:\e	
.Ic 	:file=www.spews.org/spews_list_level1.txt:
.Ic \ \	
.Ic white:\e
.Ic 	:white:\e
.Ic 	:method=file:\e
.Ic 	:file=/var/white/mywhite:\e
.Ic \ \ 
.Ic myblack:\e
.Ic 	:black:\e
.Ic 	:msg=/var/black/myblack.msg:\e
.Ic 	:method=file:\e
.Ic 	:file=/var/blck/myblack.txt
.Ed
.Pp
The default configuration file must include the entry
.Ar all
which specifies the order in which named blacklists and whitelists
are to be applied. The addresses in a whitelist are removed from the
preceeding blacklist. In the above example, if address that was present
in all three lists, blacklists
.Ar spews1
and
.Ar myblack
as well as whitelist
.Ar white ,
the address would be removed from blacklist
.Ar spews1
by the subsequent
.Ar white
whitelist. However, the address would not be removed from the
.Ar myblack
blacklist. To remove all the addresses in
.Ar white
from
.Ar myblack
the configution
.Bd -literal -offset indent
.Ic all:\e
.Ic 	:spews1:white:myblack:white:\e
.Ic 	
.Ed
would be used instead.
.Pp blacklists and whitelists are then constructed by name,
blacklists are identified by the capability
.Ar black
and whitelists by the capability
.Ar white .
.Pp
The source of the addresses for blacklists and whitelists is 
specified using the
.Ar method
and 
.Ar file
capability entries.
.Ar method
specifies the method by which to retrieve the addresses, which may
be 
.Ar http
.Ar ftp
.Ar file
or
.Ar exec .
The methods
.Ar http
.Ar ftp
and
.Ar file
capabilities will make
.Nm
retrieve the source file as specified in the location in
the 
.Ar file
capability for the list.
The
.Ar exec
capability will make 
.Nm
spawn the program with arguments indicated in the
.Ar file
capability for the list, and read the source file
from the output of the program. the source file for each blacklist or
whitelist is expected to consist of one network block or address per
line (optionally followed by a space and text that is ignored).
Comment lines beginning with
.Ar #
are ignored.
Network blocks may be specified in any of the formats as in
the following example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
.Ic # CIDR format
.Ic 192.168.20.0/24
.Ic # A start - end range
.Ic 192.168.21.0 - 192.168.21.255
.Ic # As a single IP address
.Ic 192.168.23.1
.Ed
.Pp
Each blacklist must include a message, specified with the
.Ar msg
capability as a string. The argument to 
.Ar msg
specifies the message, the message may be includes in 
quotes, in which case characters may be escaped as specified in
.Xr getcap 3
with the execption that a colon (:) is allowed in the quoted string.
Alternatively, if the argument to
.Ar msg
is not specified in quotes, it is assumed to be a local filename
from which the message text may be read.
The message is configured in 
.Xr spamd 8
