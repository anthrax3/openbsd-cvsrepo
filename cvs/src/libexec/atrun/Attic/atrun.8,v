.Sh NAME
.Nm atrun
.Nd run jobs queued for later execution
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm atrun
.Op Fl l Ar load_avg
.Op Fl d
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
runs jobs queued by
.Xr at 1 .
Root's
.Xr crontab 5
must contain the line:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
*/10     *       *       *       *       root    /usr/libexec/atrun
.Ed
.Pp
so that
.Xr atrun 8
gets called every ten minutes.
.Pp
At every invocation, every job in lowercase queues whose starting time
has passed is started.
A maximum of one batch job (denoted by uppercase queues) is started
each time
.Nm
is invoked.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl l Ar load_avg
Specifies a limiting load factor, over which batch jobs should
not be run, instead of the compiled-in value of 1.5.
.It Fl d
Debug; print error messages to standard error instead of using
.Xr syslog 3 .
.El
.Sh WARNINGS
For
.Nm
to work, you have to start up a
.Xr cron 8
daemon.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /var/at/spool -compact
.It Pa /var/at/spool
directory containing output spool files

.Sh BUGS
The functionality of
.Nm
should be merged into
.Xr cron 8 .

log
@Change all option list specifications to ".Bl -tag -width Ds". Most man
pages just needed their -width parameter tweaked to "Ds", which provides
a nice width of 6 constant characters. For consistency more than anything.

@- remove all trailing whitespace
     * except when it is escaped with a `\' at the end of the line
- fix remaining .Nm usage as well
- this is from a patch I received from kwesterback@@home.com, who has been
  working on some scripts for fixing formatting errors in mdoc'd man pages

Ok, so there could be a cost/benefit debate with this commit, but since I have
the patch we might as well commit it...

The functionality of
d66 1
a66 1
should arguaby be merged into
d68 2
a69 8
.Sh CAVEATS
Since the default configuration causes
.Nm atrun
to be invoked every ten minutes,
commands queued by
.Xr at 1
may end up being executed up to nine minutes
later than would be otherwise expected.
