.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm spamd-setup
.Nd parse and load file of spammer addresses
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm spamd-setup
.Op Fl c
.Op Fl s
.Op Fl s
.Op Fl 1
.Op Fl 2
.Op Fl f Ar file
.Op Fl w Ar file
.Op Ar file ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility adds blacklists by adding addresses to the
.Xr pf 4
table
.Aq spamd ,
as well as configuring mail rejection messages for
the added list of addresses in
.Xr spamd 8 .
The
.Aq spamd
table is used in conjuction with a
.Xr pf 4
redirection rule to selectively redirect mail connections
to the
.Xr spamd 8
daemon.
Sources and actions are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width XXXXXXXXXX
.It Fl s
The SPEWS level 1 database is fetched via
.Xr ftp 1
and used in a blacklist named
.Li spews-1 Ns .
.It Fl 1
Synonym for
.Fl s .
.It Fl 2
The SPEWS level 2 database is fetched via
.Xr ftp 1
and used in a blacklist named
.Li spews-2 Ns .
.It Fl c
The chinese netblock datbase is fetched via
.Xr ftp 1
and used in a blacklist named
.Li china Ns .
.It Fl k
The Korean netblock database is fetched via
.Xr ftp 1
and used in a blacklist named
.Li korea Ns .
.It Fl f Ar file
The local file specified is used in a black-list named
.Li local Ns .
.It Fl w Ar file
The local file specified is added to the white-list.
.El
.Pp
The arguments are processed in the order they are given and the resulting
output is concatenated to build up a table for
.Xr pf 4 .
Then the blacklist addresses are sent to a running
.Xr spamd 8
along with the message spamd will give on mail rejection when
a matching client connects.
The input file is expected to consist of one network block or address
per line (optionally followed by a space and text that is ignored).
Comment lines beginning with
.Li #
are ignored.
Network blocks may be specified in any of the formats as in
the following example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
.Ic # CIDR format
.Ic 192.168.20.0/24
.Ic # A start - end range
.Ic 192.168.21.0 - 192.168.21.255
.Ic # A masked address
.Ic 192.168.22.0:255.255.255.0
.Ic # As a single IP address
.Ic 192.168.23.1
.Ed
.Sh BLACKLIST FILES
Additional files given as parameters to
.Nm
will be read to configure blacklists.
The blacklist file format is as follows.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
.Ic SPAMD_SOURCE;mylist;"Sorry %A, You are probably spammer\enBye\en"
.Ic file:/usr/local/share/spammers.txt
.Ic http://www.somewhere.org/bigspamblocks.txt
.Ic SPAMD_SOURCE_REMOVE
.Ic file:/usr/local/share/notspammers.txt
.Ic file://www.somewhereelse.org/notspamblocks.txt
.Ic SPAMD_SOURCE;mykorealist;"Your address %A, appears to be from korea"
.Ic http://www.okean.com/koreacidr.txt
.Ic SPAMD_SOURCE_REMOVE
.Ic file:/usr/local/share/taekwondopals
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Li SPAMD_SOURCE
line includes a tag to name the blacklist, and the message to be
given to any connections that match this list.
The message must be enclosed in double quotes
and may include \en to produce a newline in the output.
\e\" will produce a double quote in the output,
and %% will produce a single % in the output.
%A will be expanded by
.Xr spamd 8
to display the connecting IP address in the output.
.Pp
Following the
.Li SPAMD_SOURCE
should be URL's, one per line, from which to fetch the
network blocks to blacklist.
Following the
.Li SPAMD_SOURCE_REMOVE
line may be further URL's, one per line, from which to
fetch network blocks that will be removed from this blacklist.

@Spamd changes to add blacklist awareness to spamd, new spamd-setup.pl
which configures individual blacklists sources and deals with whitelists.
Perl still needs some stylistic changes as suggested by bmc which will go
in shortly.
