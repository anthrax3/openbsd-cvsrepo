 *
 * A pointer to the name is returned, if found, otherwise a pointer
 * to the original "alias" argument is returned.

1.1.1.1
log
@Kerberos IV code, based on a merge of fixed code from KTH and original
4.4BSD Lite code (international edition).  Provides all functionality
from the original 4.4BSD code plus standard Kerberos elements that were
omitted in the 4.4BSD code.
