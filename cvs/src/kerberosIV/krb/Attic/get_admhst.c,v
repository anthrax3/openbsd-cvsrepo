 * Given a Kerberos realm, find a host on which the Kerberos database

 *
 * krb_get_admhst takes a pointer to be filled in, a pointer to the name
 * of the realm for which a server is desired, and an integer n, and
 * returns (in h) the nth administrative host entry from the configuration
 * file (KRB_CONF, defined in "krb.h") associated with the specified realm.
 *
 * On error, get_admhst returns KFAILURE. If all goes well, the routine
 * returns KSUCCESS.
 *
 * For the format of the KRB_CONF file, see comments describing the routine
 * krb_get_krbhst().

 * This is a temporary hack to allow us to find the nearest system running
 * a Kerberos admin server.  In the long run, this functionality will be
 * provided by a nameserver.

1.1.1.1
log
@Kerberos IV code, based on a merge of fixed code from KTH and original
4.4BSD Lite code (international edition).  Provides all functionality
from the original 4.4BSD code plus standard Kerberos elements that were
omitted in the 4.4BSD code.
