 * krb_mk_priv() constructs an AUTH_MSG_PRIVATE message.  It takes
 * some user data "in" of "length" bytes and creates a packet in "out"
 * consisting of the user data, a timestamp, and the sender's network
 * address.
 * The packet is encrypted by pcbc_encrypt(), using the given
 * "key" and "schedule".
 * The length of the resulting packet "out" is
 * returned.
 *
 * It is similar to krb_mk_safe() except for the additional key
 * schedule argument "schedule" and the fact that the data is encrypted
 * rather than appended with a checksum.  The protocol version is
 * KRB_PROT_VERSION, defined in "krb.h".
 *
 * The "out" packet consists of:
 *
 * Size			Variable		Field
 * ----			--------		-----
 *
 * 1 byte		KRB_PROT_VERSION	protocol version number
 * 1 byte		AUTH_MSG_PRIVATE |	message type plus local
 *			HOST_BYTE_ORDER		byte order in low bit
 *
 * 4 bytes		c_length		length of data
 * we encrypt from here with pcbc_encrypt
 * 
 * 4 bytes		length			length of user data
 * length		in			user data
 * 1 byte		msg_time_5ms		timestamp milliseconds
 * 4 bytes		sender->sin.addr.s_addr	sender's IP address

@Kerberos IV code, based on a merge of fixed code from KTH and original
4.4BSD Lite code (international edition).  Provides all functionality
from the original 4.4BSD code plus standard Kerberos elements that were
omitted in the 4.4BSD code.
