 * Get a ticket for the password-changing server ("changepw.KRB_MASTER").
 *
 * Given the name, instance, realm, and current password of the
 * principal for which the user wants a password-changing-ticket,
 * return either:
 *
 *	GT_PW_BADPW if current password was wrong,
 *	GT_PW_NULL  if principal had a NULL password,
 *	or the result of the krb_get_pw_in_tkt() call.
 *
 * First, try to get a ticket for "user.instance@@realm" to use the
 * "changepw.KRB_MASTER" server (KRB_MASTER is defined in "krb.h").
 * The requested lifetime for the ticket is "1", and the current
 * password is the "cpw" argument given.
 *
 * If the password was bad, give up.
 *
 * If the principal had a NULL password in the Kerberos database
 * (indicating that the principal is known to Kerberos, but hasn't
 * got a password yet), try instead to get a ticket for the principal
 * "default.changepw@@realm" to use the "changepw.KRB_MASTER" server.
 * Use the password "changepwkrb" instead of "cpw".  Return GT_PW_NULL
 * if all goes well, otherwise the error.
 *
 * If this routine succeeds, a ticket and session key for either the
 * principal "user.instance@@realm" or "default.changepw@@realm" to use
 * the password-changing server will be in the user's ticket file.

@Kerberos IV code, based on a merge of fixed code from KTH and original
4.4BSD Lite code (international edition).  Provides all functionality
from the original 4.4BSD code plus standard Kerberos elements that were
omitted in the 4.4BSD code.
