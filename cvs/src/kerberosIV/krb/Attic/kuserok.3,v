.TH KUSEROK 3 "Kerberos Version 4.0" "MIT Project Athena"
.SH NAME
kuserok \- Kerberos version of ruserok
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.nj
.ft B
#include <kerberosIV/krb.h>
.PP
.ft B
kuserok(kdata, localuser)
AUTH_DAT *auth_data;
char   *localuser;
.fi
.ft R
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I kuserok
determines whether a Kerberos principal described by the structure
.I auth_data
is authorized to login as user
.I localuser
according to the authorization file
("~\fIlocaluser\fR/.klogin" by default).  It returns 0 (zero) if authorized,
1 (one) if not authorized.
.PP
If there is no account for 
.I localuser
on the local machine, authorization is not granted.
If there is no authorization file, and the Kerberos principal described
by 
.I auth_data
translates to 
.I localuser
(using 
.IR krb_kntoln (3)),
authorization is granted.
If the authorization file
can't be accessed, or the file is not owned by
.IR localuser,
authorization is denied.  Otherwise, the file is searched for
a matching principal name, instance, and realm.  If a match is found,
authorization is granted, else authorization is denied.
.PP
The file entries are in the format:
.nf
.in +5n
	name.instance@@realm
.in -5n
.fi
with one entry per line.

log
@Kerberos IV code, based on a merge of fixed code from KTH and original
4.4BSD Lite code (international edition).  Provides all functionality
from the original 4.4BSD code plus standard Kerberos elements that were
omitted in the 4.4BSD code.
