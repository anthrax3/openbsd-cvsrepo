/*
 * Given a Kerberos realm, find a host on which the Kerberos authenti-
 * cation server can be found.
 *
 * krb_get_krbhst takes a pointer to be filled in, a pointer to the name
 * of the realm for which a server is desired, and an integer, n, and
 * returns (in h) the nth entry from the configuration file (KRB_CONF,
 * defined in "krb.h") associated with the specified realm.
 *
 * On end-of-file, krb_get_krbhst returns KFAILURE. If all goes well,
 * the routine returns KSUCCESS.
 *
 * The KRB_CONF file contains the name of the local realm in the first
 * line (not used by this routine), followed by lines indicating realm/host
 * entries.  The words "admin server" following the hostname indicate that 
 * the host provides an administrative database server.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 *	ATHENA.MIT.EDU
 *	ATHENA.MIT.EDU kerberos-1.mit.edu admin server
 *	ATHENA.MIT.EDU kerberos-2.mit.edu
 *	LCS.MIT.EDU kerberos.lcs.mit.edu admin server
 *
 * This is a temporary hack to allow us to find the nearest system running
 * kerberos.  In the long run, this functionality will be provided by a
 * nameserver.

1.1.1.1
log
@Kerberos IV code, based on a merge of fixed code from KTH and original
4.4BSD Lite code (international edition).  Provides all functionality
from the original 4.4BSD code plus standard Kerberos elements that were
omitted in the 4.4BSD code.
