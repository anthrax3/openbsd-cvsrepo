.SH NAME
register \- register with Kerberos
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B register
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I register
command
is used to register a new user with Kerberos.
The Kerberos server keeps record of certain trusted hosts
from which it will accept new registrations.
If the host on which
.I register
is run is trusted by Kerberos, the user
is asked for his current password, and then
a new password to be used with Kerberos.
A user may only register with Kerberos one time.
.SH FILES
.br
/.update.keyxx.xx.xx.xx    shared DES key with server
.SH "SEE ALSO"
registerd(8), kerberos(1)
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
\*(lqPrincipal not unique\*(rq
if the user already exists in the Kerberos database.
.br
\*(lqPermission Denied,\*(rq
if the host on which register is being run is untrusted.

4.4BSD Lite code (international edition).  Provides all functionality
from the original 4.4BSD code plus standard Kerberos elements that were
omitted in the 4.4BSD code.
