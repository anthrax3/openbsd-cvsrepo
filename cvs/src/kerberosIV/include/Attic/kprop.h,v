 * USA State Department, who handed it to the Commerce department.  The
 * code was determined to fall under General License GTDA under ECCN 5D96G,
 * and hence exportable.  The cryptographic interfaces were re-added by Eric
 * Young, and then KTH proceeded to maintain the code in the free world.

@Kerberos IV code, based on a merge of fixed code from KTH and original
4.4BSD Lite code (international edition).  Provides all functionality
from the original 4.4BSD code plus standard Kerberos elements that were
omitted in the 4.4BSD code.
