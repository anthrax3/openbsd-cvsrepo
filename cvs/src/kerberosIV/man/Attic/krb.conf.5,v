.Sh NAME
.Nm krb.conf
.Nd Kerberos configuration file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
contains configuration information describing the Kerberos realm and the
Kerberos key distribution center (KDC) servers for known realms.
.Pp
The first line of
.Nm
contains the name of the local realm. If the first character in the first line
is a hash sign
.Pq Ql # ,
then Kerberos authentication is disabled.
.Pp
Subsequent lines are of the form
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Fa realm
.Fa KDC_server
.Op admin server
.Ed
.Pp
where
.Fa realm
is a Kerberos realm name and
.Fa KDC_server
is the name of a host running a KDC for
.Fa realm .
The words
.Dq admin server
following
.Fa KDC_server
indicate that the host also provides an administrative database server.
.Sh EXAMPLES
A krb.conf file for a host in the ATHENA.MIT.EDU realm might look like:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
ATHENA.MIT.EDU
ATHENA.MIT.EDU kerberos-1.mit.edu admin server
ATHENA.MIT.EDU kerberos-2.mit.edu
LCS.MIT.EDU kerberos.lcs.mit.edu admin server

@The proper order of the ``introductory'' macros in a man page is .Dd/.Dt/.Os.
Out of the approximately 1450 man pages, only about 90 of them were wrong.
Thanks to kwesterback@@home.com for coming up with a script and patch to repair
this. The patch also inserted a .Os macro in the few man pages that were
missing one.

.SH NAME
krb.conf \- Kerberos configuration file
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I krb.conf
d40 30
a69 15
.PP
.I krb.conf
contains the name of the local realm in the first
line, followed by lines indicating realm/host
entries.  The first token is a realm name, and the second is the hostname
of a host running a KDC for that realm.
The words "admin server" following the hostname indicate that 
the host also provides an administrative database server.

A hash sign (#) as a first character of the krb.conf file disables kerberos
authentication on the system.

For example:
.nf
.in +1i
d74 5
a78 4
.in -1i
