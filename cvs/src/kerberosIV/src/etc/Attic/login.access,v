@# Sample /etc/login.access file read by the login program
#
# Login access control table.
# 
# When someone logs in, the table is scanned for the first entry that
# matches the (user, host) combination, or, in case of non-networked
# logins, the first entry that matches the (user, tty) combination.  The
# permissions field of that table entry determines whether the login will 
# be accepted or refused.
# 
# Format of the login access control table is three fields separated by a
# ":" character:
# 
# 	permission : users : origins
# 
# The first field should be a "+" (access granted) or "-" (access denied)
# character. 
#
# The second field should be a list of one or more login names, group
# names, or ALL (always matches). A pattern of the form user@@host is
# matched when the login name matches the "user" part, and when the
# "host" part matches the local machine name.
#
# The third field should be a list of one or more tty names (for
# non-networked logins), host names, domain names (begin with "."), host
# addresses, internet network numbers (end with "."), ALL (always
# matches) or LOCAL (matches any string that does not contain a "."
# character).
#
# If you run NIS you can use @@netgroupname in host or user patterns; this
# even works for @@usergroup@@@@hostgroup patterns. Weird.
#
# The EXCEPT operator makes it possible to write very compact rules.
#
# The group file is searched only when a name does not match that of the
# logged-in user. Only groups are matched in which users are explicitly
# listed: the program does not look at a user's primary group id value.
