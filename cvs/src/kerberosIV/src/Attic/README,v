*** PLEASE REPORT BUGS AND PROBLEMS TO kth-krb-bugs@@nada.kth.se ***

This is a severly hacked up version of Eric Young's eBones-p9 kerberos
version. The DES library has been updated with his 3.23 version and
numerous patches collected over the years have been applied to both
the kerberos and DES sources, most notably the CMU patches for extended
lifetimes that AFS uses. There is also support for AFS built into most
programs. 

The source has been changed to use ANSI C and POSIX to the largest
possible extent. The code in util/et and appl/bsd have not been
updated in this way though (they really need it).

Telnet and telnetd are based on the telnet.95.10.23.NE.tar.Z. Kerberos
authentication is the default and warnings are issued by telnetd if
the telnet client does not turn on encryption.

The r* programs in appl/bsd have been updated with newer sources from
NetBSD and FreeBSD. NOTE: use of telnet is prefered to the use of
rlogin which is a temporary hack and not an Internet standard (and has
only been documented quite recently).  Telnet uses kerberos
authentication to prevent the passing of cleartext passwords and is
thus superior to rlogin.

The distribution has been configured to primarily use kerberos
authentication with a fallback to /etc/passwd passwords. This should
make it easy to do a slow migration to kerberos.  OTP support is also
included in login, popper, and ftpd.

All programs in this distribution follow these conventions:

/usr/athena/bin:	User programs
/usr/athena/sbin:	Administrator programs
/usr/athena/libexec:	Daemons
/etc:			Configuration files
/var/log:		Logfiles
/var/kerberos:		Kerberos database and ACL files

A W3-page is at http://www.pdc.kth.se/kth-krb/

You can get some documentation from ftp://ftp.pdc.kth.se/pub/krb/doc.

Please report bugs and problems to kth-krb-bugs@@nada.kth.se

There is a mailing list discussing kerberos at krb4@@sics.se, send a
message to majordomo@@sics.se to subscribe.
