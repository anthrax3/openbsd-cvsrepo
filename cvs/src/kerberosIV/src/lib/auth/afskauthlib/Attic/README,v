IRIX
----

The IRIX support is a module that is compatible with Transarc's
`afskauthlib.so'.  It should work with all programs that use this
library, this should include `login' and `xdm'.

The interface is not very documented but it seems that you have to copy
`libkafs.so', `libkrb.so', and `libdes.so' to `/usr/lib', or build your
`afskauthlib.so' statically.

The `afskauthlib.so' itself is able to reside in `/usr/vice/etc',
`/usr/afsws/lib', or the current directory (wherever that is).

IRIX 6.4 and newer seems to have all programs (including `xdm' and
`login') in the N32 object format, whereas in older versions they were
O32. For it to work, the `afskauthlib.so' library has to be in the same
object format as the program that tries to load it. This might require
that you have to configure and build for O32 in addition to the default
N32.

Appart from this it should "just work", there are no configuration
files.
