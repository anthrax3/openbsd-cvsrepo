.TH KLIST 1 "Kerberos Version 4.0" "MIT Project Athena"
.SH NAME
klist \- list currently held Kerberos tickets
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B klist
[
\fB\-s \fR|\fB \-t\fR
] [
.B \-file
name ] [
.B \-srvtab
]
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I klist
prints the name of the tickets file and the
identity of the principal the tickets are for (as listed in the
tickets file), and 
lists the principal names of all Kerberos tickets currently held by
the user, along with the issue and expire time for each authenticator.
Principal names are listed in the form
.I name.instance@@realm,
with the '.' omitted if the instance is null,
and the '@@' omitted if the realm is null.

If given the
.B \-s
option,
.I klist
does not print the issue and expire times, the name of the tickets file,
or the identity of the principal.

If given the
.B \-t
option, 
.B klist
checks for the existence of a non-expired ticket-granting-ticket in the
ticket file.  If one is present, it exits with status 0, else it exits
with status 1.  No output is generated when this option is specified. 

If given the
.B \-file
option, the following argument is used as the ticket file.
Otherwise, if the
.B KRBTKFILE
environment variable is set, it is used.
If this environment variable
is not set, the file
.B /tmp/tkt[uid]
is used, where
.B uid
is the current user-id of the user.

If given the
.B \-srvtab
option, the file is treated as a service key file, and the names of the
keys contained therein are printed.  If no file is
specified with a
.B \-file
option, the default is
.IR /etc/kerberosIV/srvtab .
.SH FILES
.TP 2i
/etc/krb.conf
to get the name of the local realm
.TP
/tmp/tkt[uid]
as the default ticket file ([uid] is the decimal UID of the user).
.TP
/etc/kerberosIV/srvtab
as the default service key file
.SH SEE ALSO
.PP
.Xr kerberos 1 ,
.Xr kinit 1 ,
.Xr kdestroy 1
.SH BUGS
When reading a file as a service key file, very little sanity or error
checking is performed.
