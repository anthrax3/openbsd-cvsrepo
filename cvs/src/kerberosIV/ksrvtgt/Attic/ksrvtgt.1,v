.SH NAME
ksrvtgt \- fetch and store Kerberos ticket-granting-ticket using a
service key
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ksrvtgt
name instance [[realm] srvtab]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I ksrvtgt
retrieves a ticket-granting ticket with a lifetime of five (5) minutes
for the principal
.I name.instance@@realm
(or 
.I name.instance@@localrealm
if
.I realm
is not supplied on the command line), decrypts the response using
the service key found in
.I srvtab
(or in 
.B /etc/kerberosIV/srvtab
if
.I srvtab
is not specified on the command line), and stores the ticket in the
standard ticket cache.
.PP
This command is intended primarily for use in shell scripts and other
batch-type facilities.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
"Generic kerberos failure (kfailure)" can indicate a whole range of
problems, the most common of which is the inability to read the service
key file.
.SH FILES
.TP 2i
/etc/kerberosIV/krb.conf
to get the name of the local realm.
.TP
/tmp/tkt[uid]
The default ticket file.
.TP
/etc/kerberosIV/srvtab
The default service key file.
.SH SEE ALSO

@Kerberos IV code, based on a merge of fixed code from KTH and original
4.4BSD Lite code (international edition).  Provides all functionality
