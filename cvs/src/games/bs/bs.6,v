.Nd battleships game
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm bs
.Op Fl b | s
.Op Fl c
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This program allows you to play the familiar Battleships game against the
computer on a 10x10 board.
The interface is visual and largely self-explanatory;
you place your ships and pick your shots by moving the cursor around the
.Sq sea
with the
.Xr hack 6
motion keys
.Em hjklyubn .
.Pp
Note that when selecting a ship to place, you must type the capital letter
(these are, after all, capital ships).
During ship placement, the
.Sq r
command may be used to ignore the current position and randomly place your
currently selected ship.
The
.Sq R
command will place all remaining ships randomly.
The ^L command
.Pq form feed, ASCII 12
will force a screen redraw.
.Pp
The command-line arguments control game modes:
.Bl -tag -width XxXXX
.It Fl b
Selects a
.Sq blitz
variant.
This allows a side to shoot for as long as it continues to score hits.
.It Fl c
Permits ships to be placed adjacently.
Normally, ships must be separated by at least one square of open water.
This disables that check and allows them to close-pack.
.It Fl s
Selects a
.Sq salvo
variant.
This allows a player one shot per turn for each of his/her
ships still afloat.
This puts a premium on scoring hits early and knocking out
some ships and also makes it much harder, for example, when you face a superior
force with only your PT-boat.

@- remove all trailing whitespace
     * except when it is escaped with a `\' at the end of the line
- fix remaining .Nm usage as well
- this is from a patch I received from kwesterback@@home.com, who has been
  working on some scripts for fixing formatting errors in mdoc'd man pages

Ok, so there could be a cost/benefit debate with this commit, but since I have
the patch we might as well commit it...

@The proper order of the ``introductory'' macros in a man page is .Dd/.Dt/.Os.
Out of the approximately 1450 man pages, only about 90 of them were wrong.
Thanks to kwesterback@@home.com for coming up with a script and patch to repair
this. The patch also inserted a .Os macro in the few man pages that were
missing one.
