.Sh NAME
.Nm backgammon
.Nd the game of backgammon
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm backgammon
.Op Fl bdnrw
.Op Fl s Ar file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This program lets you play backgammon against the computer
or against a
.Sq friend .
All commands are only one letter,
so you don't need to type a carriage return,
except at the end of a move.
The program is mostly self-explanatory:
a question mark (?) will usually get some help.
If you answer
.Sq y
when the program asks if you want the rules,
you will get text explaining the rules of the game,
some hints on strategy,
instructions on how to use the program,
and a tutorial consisting of a practice game against the computer.
A description of how to use the program can be
obtained by answering
.Sq y
when it asks if you want instructions.
.Pp
The possible arguments for
.Nm
are described below.
In each case
.Fl n
is implied.
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl b
Two players, red and white.
.It Fl d
Play without doubling.
.It Fl n
Don't ask for rules or instructions.
.It Fl r
Player is red.
.It Fl s Ar file
Recover previously saved game from
.Ar file .
.It Fl w
Player is white.
.El
.Sh QUICK REFERENCE
When the program prompts by typing only your color,
type a space or carriage return to roll,
or one of the following:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent -compact
.It Ic d
to double
.It Ic q
to quit
.It Ic r
to redraw the board
.It Ic s
to save the game for later
.El
.Pp
When the program prompts with 'Move:',
type one of the following:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent -compact
.It Ic q
to quit
.It Ic r
to redraw the board
.It Ic s
to save the game
.El
.Pp
Or a
.Em move ,
which is a sequence of one of the following:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent -compact
.It Ic s-f
move from
.Ic s
to
.Ic f
.It Ic s/r
move one man on
.Ic s
the roll
.Ic r
separated by commas or spaces and ending with a newline.
Available abbreviations are as follows:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "s-f1-f2XXX" -offset indent -compact
.It Ic s-f1-f2
means
.Ic s-f1,f1-f2
.It Ic s/r1r2
means
.Ic s/r1,s/r2
.El
.El
.Pp
Use
.Ic b
for bar and
.Ic h
for home,
or 0 or 25 as appropriate.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /usr/games/teachgammon -compact
.It Pa /usr/games/teachgammon
rules and tutorial
.El
.Sh HISTORY
The game
.Nm
first appeared in
.Bx 3 .
.Sh AUTHORS
.An -nosplit
.An Alan Char
.Pp
The strategy is the
.Dq pubeval
algorithm of
.An Gerry Tesauro ,
with minimal doubling logic added.

- fix remaining .Nm usage as well
- this is from a patch I received from kwesterback@@home.com, who has been

Ok, so there could be a cost/benefit debate with this commit, but since I have
the patch we might as well commit it...
