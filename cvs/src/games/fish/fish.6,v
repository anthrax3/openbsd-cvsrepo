.Sh NAME
.Nm fish
.Nd play ``Go Fish''
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm fish
.Op Fl p
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is the game
.Dq Go Fish ,
a traditional children's card game.
.Pp
The computer deals the player and itself seven cards each, and places
the rest of the deck face-down (figuratively), to be drawn from later.
The object of the game is to collect
.Dq books ,
or all of the cards of a given rank.
For example, collecting four 2's would give the player a
.Dq book of 2's .
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl p
Professional mode.
.El
.Pp
The computer makes a random decision as to who gets to start the
game, and then the computer and player take turns asking each other
for cards by rank.
If the asked player has any cards of the requested rank, they must be given
up to the asking player.
There must be at least one card of the requested rank already in the asking
player's hand.
When the asked player has no
cards of the requested rank, the asker is told to
.Dq Go Fish!
Then, the asker draws a card from the deck.
If the card drawn is of the rank asked for, the turn continues;
otherwise, it becomes the other player's turn.
.Pp
When a player completes a book, either by getting cards from the
other player or by drawing from the deck, those cards are set aside and
the rank is no longer in play.
.Pp
The game ends when one player no longer has any cards.
The player with the most books wins.
.Pp
.Nm
provides instructions as to what input it accepts.
.Sh BUGS
The computer cheats only rarely.

@- remove all trailing whitespace
     * except when it is escaped with a `\' at the end of the line
- fix remaining .Nm usage as well
- this is from a patch I received from kwesterback@@home.com, who has been
  working on some scripts for fixing formatting errors in mdoc'd man pages

Ok, so there could be a cost/benefit debate with this commit, but since I have
the patch we might as well commit it...
