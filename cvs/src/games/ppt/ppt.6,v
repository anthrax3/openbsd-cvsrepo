1.1
log
@Split bcd(6), morse(6), and ppt(6) into three separate manuals
since most of the text is different.
Improve the SYNOPSIS according to suggestions by jmc@@, tweaked by me.
Delete a few redundant words, applying a patch from jmc@@.
Intentionally not doing any other text changes in this commit;
for further tweaking in the tree.

jmc@@, tedu@@, and millert@@ agree with the general direction, and
deraadt@@ suspects we are "all grey beard fanatics" (in all caps).
