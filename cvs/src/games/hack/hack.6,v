.Dt HACK 6
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm hack
.Nd Exploring The Dungeons of Doom
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm hack
.Op Fl n
.Op Fl d Ar directory
.Op Fl u Ar playername
.Nm hack
.Op Fl sX
.Op Fl d Ar directory
.Op Ar playername ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Bf -symbolic
.Nm
is currently unusable because it relies on
.Xr setgid 2
to allow multiple users read and write access to the same files.
.Ef
.Pp
.Nm
is a display oriented dungeons & dragons - like game.
Both display and command structure resemble rogue.
(For a game with the same structure but entirely different display -
a real cave instead of dull rectangles - try Quest.)
.Pp
To get started you really only need to know two commands.
The command
.Ic ?\&
will give you a list of the available commands and the command
.Ic /
will identify the things you see on the screen.
.Pp
To win the game (as opposed to merely playing to beat other people's high
scores) you must locate the Amulet of Yendor which is somewhere below
the 20th level of the dungeon and get it out.
Nobody has achieved this yet and if somebody does,
he will probably go down in history as a hero among heroes.
.Pp
When the game ends, either by your death, when you quit, or if you escape
from the caves,
.Nm
will give you (a fragment of) the list of top scorers.
The scoring is based on many aspects of your behavior but a rough estimate is
obtained by taking the amount of gold you've found in the cave plus four
times your (real) experience.
Precious stones may be worth a lot of gold when brought to the exit.
There is a 10% penalty for getting yourself killed.
.Pp
The administration of the game is kept in the directory specified with the
.Fl d
option or, if no such option is given, in the directory specified by
the environment variable
.Ev HACKDIR ,
or, if no such variable exists, in the current directory.
This same directory contains several auxiliary files such as lockfiles and
the list of topscorers and a subdirectory
.Pa save
where games are saved.
The game administrator may however choose to install hack with a fixed
playing ground, usually
.Pa /var/games/hackdir .
.Pp
The
.Fl n
option suppresses printing of the news.
.Pp
The
.Fl u
.Ar playername
option supplies the answer to the question "Who are you?".
When
.Ar playername
has as suffix one of
.Em -T ,
.Em -S ,
.Em -K ,
.Em -F ,
.Em -C ,
or
.Em -W ,
then this supplies the answer to the question "What kind of character ... ?".
.Pp
The
.Fl s
option will print out the list of your scores.
It may be followed by arguments
.Fl X
where X is one of the letters C, F, K, S, T, W to print the scores of
Cavemen, Fighters, Knights, Speleologists, Tourists or Wizards.
It may also be followed by one or more player names to print the scores of the
players mentioned.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width 24n -compact
.It Ev USER No or Ev LOGNAME
Your login name.
.It Ev HOME
Your home directory.
.It Ev SHELL
Your shell.
.It Ev TERM
The type of your terminal.
.It Ev HACKPAGER, PAGER
Pager used instead of default pager.
.It Ev MAIL
Mailbox file.
.It Ev MAILREADER
Reader used instead of default (probably /usr/bin/mail).
.It Ev HACKDIR
Playground.
.It Ev HACKOPTIONS
String predefining several hack options (see help file).
.El
.Pp
Several other environment variables are used in debugging (wizard) mode,
like
.Ev GENOCIDED ,
.Ev INVENT ,
.Ev MAGIC
and
.Ev SHOPTYPE .
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width 24n -compact
.It Pa hack
The hack program.
.It Pa data , rumors
Data files used by hack.
.It Pa help , hh
Help data files.
.It Pa record
The list of topscorers.
.It Pa save
A subdirectory containing the saved games.
.It Pa bones_dd
Descriptions of the ghost and belongings of a deceased adventurer.
.It Pa xlock.dd
Description of a dungeon level.
.It Pa safelock
Lock file for xlock.
.It Pa record_lock
Lock file for record.

@- remove all trailing whitespace

- fix remaining .Nm usage as well
- this is from a patch I received from kwesterback@@home.com, who has been
  working on some scripts for fixing formatting errors in mdoc'd man pages

Ok, so there could be a cost/benefit debate with this commit, but since I have
the patch we might as well commit it...
