@This diff is rather large, but it's just simply removing unnecessary headers
, remove some lint-style comments, add missing void to functions without args,
also some function prototypes (extern) were missing their args, so I added them
as they were defined in hack.h

OK tb@@ on separate diffs

@rcsid[] and sccsid[] and copyright[] are essentially unmaintained (and
unmaintainable).  these days, people use source.  these id's do not provide
any benefit, and do hurt the small install media
(the 33,000 line diff is essentially mechanical)
