@OK, this is a strange case.  At least some parts of this software is
copyrighted, and then marked "Copying for Profit is Prohibited", but
the author has passed away.  A number of people have tried to make
some sort of effort at trying to contact his estate, and have failed.
Therefore, lacking the ability to correct this copyright, we must
delete it.  I would bet strongly that this is not what the author
would have intended, but until we can get this resolved, this is the
action we must take.

This is true when visiting the bank, or when contributing at altars.
.Pp
You can get out of the store, trading post, school, or home by hitting
.Sy <esc> .
.Pp
When casting a spell, if you need a list of spells you can cast, type \fBD\fP
as the first letter of your spell.
The available list of spells will be shown,
after which you may enter the spell code.
This only works on the first letter of the spell you are casting.

@Prune some obsolete defines, in particular VT100.  Eventually curses will
  replace termios.
Use system-defined limits for path lengths and usernames.
Use strlcpy() for convenience and to avoid a possible buffer overflow or two.
