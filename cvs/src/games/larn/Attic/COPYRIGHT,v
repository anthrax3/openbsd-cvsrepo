@OK, this is a strange case.  At least some parts of this software is
copyrighted, and then marked "Copying for Profit is Prohibited", but
the author has passed away.  A number of people have tried to make
some sort of effort at trying to contact his estate, and have failed.
Therefore, lacking the ability to correct this copyright, we must
delete it.  I would bet strongly that this is not what the author
would have intended, but until we can get this resolved, this is the
action we must take.
