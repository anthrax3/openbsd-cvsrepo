@OK, this is a strange case.  At least some parts of this software is
copyrighted, and then marked "Copying for Profit is Prohibited", but
the author has passed away.  A number of people have tried to make
some sort of effort at trying to contact his estate, and have failed.
Therefore, lacking the ability to correct this copyright, we must
delete it.  I would bet strongly that this is not what the author
would have intended, but until we can get this resolved, this is the
action we must take.

@5    Welcome to the game of Larn.  At this moment, you face a great problem.
Your daughter has contracted a strange disease, and none of your home remedies
seem to have any effect.  You sense that she is in mortal danger, and you must
try to save her.  Time ago you heard of a land of great danger and opportunity.
Perhaps here is the solution you need.

    It has been said that there once was a great magician who called himself
Polinneaus.  Many years ago, after having many miraculous successes, Polinneaus
retired to the caverns of Larn, where he devoted most of his time to the
creation of magic.   Rumors have it that one day Polinneaus set out to dispel
an attacking army in a forest some distance to the north.  It is believed that
here he met his demise.

    The caverns of Larn, it is thought, must be magnificent in design,
and contain much magic and treasure.  One option you have is to undertake a
journey into these caverns.


    Good Luck!  You're going to need it!

			    [7mSpecial Notes[m

When [7mdropping gold[m, if you type '*' as your amount, all your gold gets dropped.
In general, typing in '*' means all of what you're interested in.  This is true
when visiting the bank, or when contributing at altars.

Larn may need a [7mVT100[m to operate.  A check is made of the environment variable
[7m"TERM"[m and it must be equal to [7m"vt100"[m.  This only applies if 
the game has been compiled with "VT100" defined in the Makefile.  If compiled
to use [7mtermcap[m, there are no terminal restrictions, save needing cm, ce, & cl
termcap entries.

When in the store, trading post, school, or home, an [7m<escape>[m will get you out.

larn -l           print out the larn log file 

When casting a spell, if you need a list of spells you can cast, type '[7mD[m' as
the first letter of your spell.  The available list of spells will be shown,
after which you may enter the spell code.  This only works on the 1st letter
of the spell you are casting.

		    [7mHow to use the .larnopts option file[m

The file ".larnopts", if used, should be in your home directory (see -o).
A sequence of words terminated by whitespace is used to specify options.

	Word                     Meaning

    bold-objects		  select bold display of objects
    inverse-objects		  select inverse video display of objects
    no-introduction		  do not display intro message
    enable-checkpointing          turn on periodic checkpointing
    no-beep			  disable beeping of the terminal
    male			  choose your sex to be a man
    female			  choose your sex to be a woman
    name: "your name"		  choose your playing name
    monster: "monst name"	  choose a name for a monster
    savefile: "save-file-name"    define what the savegame filename will be

Your name and monster names must be enclosed in double quotation marks and may
be up to 34 characters long.  Longer names are truncated.  Anything enclosed in
quotation marks is considered one word, and must be separated from other words
by whitespace.

	       [7mExplanation of the Larn scoreboard facility[m

    Larn supports TWO scoreboards, one for winners, and one for deceased
characters.  Each player (by userid or playerid, see UIDSCORE in Makefile)
is allowed one slot on each scoreboard, if the score is in the top ten for
that scoreboard.  This design helps insure that frequent players of Larn
do not hog the scoreboard, and gives more players a chance for glory.  Level
of difficulty is also noted on the scoreboards, and this takes precedence
over score for determining what entry is on the scoreboard.  For example:
if "Yar, the Bug Slayer" has a score of 128003 on the scoreboard at diff 0,
then his game at diff 1 and a score of 4112 would replace his previous
entry on the scoreboard.  Note that when a player dies, his inventory is
stored in the scoreboard so that everyone can see what items the player had
at the time of his death.
