log
@Fix a few bugs (e.g. snake used to miss turns); use usleep() so display
speed is correct on xterms; put snscore functionality inside snake and
make snscore a symbolic link (to be phased out); clean up formatting;
install score file properly; disable the log file by default (logging should
be done through dm).
