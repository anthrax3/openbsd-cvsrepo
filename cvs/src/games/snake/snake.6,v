.Sh NAME
.Nm snake
.Nd display chase game
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm snake
.Op Fl st
.Op Fl l Ar length
.Op Fl w Ar width
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm snake
is a display-based game.
The object of the game is to make as much money as possible without
getting eaten by the snake.
The
.Fl l
and
.Fl w
options allow you to specify the length and width of the field.
By default the entire screen (except for the last column) is used.
The
.Fl s
option shows all scores.
The
.Fl t
option makes the game assume you are on a slow terminal.
.Pp
You are represented on the screen by an I.
The snake is 6 squares long and is represented by s's with an S at the head.
The money is $, and an exit is #.
Your score is posted in the upper left hand corner.
.Pp
You can move around using the same conventions as
.Xr vi 1 :
that is, the
.Ic h ,
.Ic j ,
.Ic k ,
and
.Ic l
keys work, as do the arrow keys.
Other possibilities include:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Ic sefc
These keys are like hjkl but form a directed pad around the d key.
.It Ic HJKL
These keys move you all the way in the indicated direction to the
same row or column as the money.
This does
.Em not
let you jump away from the snake, but rather saves you from having
to type a key repeatedly.
The snake still gets all his turns.
.It Ic SEFC
Likewise for the upper case versions on the left.
.It Ic ATPB
These keys move you to the four edges of the screen.
Their position on the keyboard is mnemonic, e.g.\&
P is at the far right of the keyboard.
.It Ic x
This lets you quit the game at any time.
.It Ic p
Sometimes points in a direction you might want to go.
.It Ic w
Space warp to get out of tight squeezes, at a price.
.El
.Pp
To earn money, move to the same square the money is on.
A new $ will appear when you earn the current one.
As you get richer, the snake gets hungrier.
To leave the game, move to the exit (#).
.Pp
A record is kept of the personal best score of each player.
Scores are only counted if you leave at the exit.
Getting eaten by the snake is worth nothing.
.Pp
As in pinball, matching the last digit of your score to the number
which appears after the game is worth a bonus.
.Pp
To see who wastes time playing snake, run
.Nm snake
.Fl s .
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width $HOME/.snake.scores
.It Ev LOGNAME
Name displayed in high score file.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width $HOME/.snake.scores
.It Pa $HOME/.snake.scores
Database of personal bests.
.\".It Pa $HOME/.snake.log
.\"log of games played
.El
.Sh BUGS
When playing on a small screen,
it's hard to tell when you hit the edge of the screen.
.Pp
The scoring function takes into account the size of the screen.
A perfect function to do this equitably has not been devised.

@Fix after removal of the setgid bit:

Add pledge "stdio rpath wpath cpath tty".
Move score file to $HOME, add $USER as high score entry.
Maintain hall of fame of 10 high scores, make snake wink if
it ate you while you were eligible for eternal fame.

Based on an initial diff by Ricardo Mestre and with helpful input from tedu@@.

- fix remaining .Nm usage as well
- this is from a patch I received from kwesterback@@home.com, who has been
  working on some scripts for fixing formatting errors in mdoc'd man pages

Ok, so there could be a cost/benefit debate with this commit, but since I have
the patch we might as well commit it...
