@ANSIfy trek(6)

Note: Binary change is introduced due to function schedule() where its args are
(int,double,char,char,char), but on trek.h are (int,double,int,int,int). Changed
to the latter since the 3 last args are coordinates.

@rcsid[] and sccsid[] and copyright[] are essentially unmaintained (and
unmaintainable).  these days, people use source.  these id's do not provide
any benefit, and do hurt the small install media
(the 33,000 line diff is essentially mechanical)
