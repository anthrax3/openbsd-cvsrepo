@- ranf() and franf() are prototyped on trek.h but ranf.c doesn't include it so
do it
- Replace random() >> 5 by only random(): this was discussed a few months ago
and naddy@@ said at the time "Those games were originally written with the
rand(3) function. The lower bits returned by rand(3) suffered from notoriously
poor randomness, so this idiom developed where people would use the higher,
more random bits."

OK tb@@ after his remarks

@ANSIfy trek(6)

Note: Binary change is introduced due to function schedule() where its args are
(int,double,char,char,char), but on trek.h are (int,double,int,int,int). Changed
to the latter since the 3 last args are coordinates.

@rcsid[] and sccsid[] and copyright[] are essentially unmaintained (and
unmaintainable).  these days, people use source.  these id's do not provide
any benefit, and do hurt the small install media
(the 33,000 line diff is essentially mechanical)
ok with the idea millert, ok dms
