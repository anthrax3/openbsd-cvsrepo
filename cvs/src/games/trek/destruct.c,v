@ANSIfy trek(6)

Note: Binary change is introduced due to function schedule() where its args are
(int,double,char,char,char), but on trek.h are (int,double,int,int,int). Changed
to the latter since the 3 last args are coordinates.

**  Self Destruct Sequence
**
**	The computer starts up the self destruct sequence.  Obviously,
**	if the computer is out nothing can happen.  You get a countdown
**	and a request for password.  This must match the password that
**	you entered at the start of the game.
**
**	You get to destroy things when you blow up; hence, it is
**	possible to win the game by destructing if you take the last
**	Klingon with you.
**
**	There used to be a \032 in the message (^Z), which is because
**	the terminal in Allman's office was an ADM-3, which uses that char-
**	acter to clear the screen.  There was also a \014 (form feed)
**	because that clears some other screens.  Now there is nothing.
**	Presumably the most general screen clear today would be

@rcsid[] and sccsid[] and copyright[] are essentially unmaintained (and
unmaintainable).  these days, people use source.  these id's do not provide
any benefit, and do hurt the small install media
