@ANSIfy trek(6)

Note: Binary change is introduced due to function schedule() where its args are
(int,double,char,char,char), but on trek.h are (int,double,int,int,int). Changed
to the latter since the 3 last args are coordinates.

OK tb@@

**  Check for Condition After a Move
**
**	Various ship conditions are checked.  First we check
**	to see if we have already lost the game, due to running
**	out of life support reserves, running out of energy,
**	or running out of crew members.  The check for running
**	out of time is in events().
**
**	If we are in automatic override mode (Etc.nkling < 0), we
**	don't want to do anything else, lest we call autover
**	recursively.
**
**	In the normal case, if there is a supernova, we call
**	autover() to help us escape.  If after calling autover()
**	we are still in the grips of a supernova, we get burnt
**	up.
**
**	If there are no Klingons in this quadrant, we nullify any
**	distress calls which might exist.
**
**	We then set the condition code, based on the energy level
**	and battle conditions.

@rcsid[] and sccsid[] and copyright[] are essentially unmaintained (and
unmaintainable).  these days, people use source.  these id's do not provide
any benefit, and do hurt the small install media
(the 33,000 line diff is essentially mechanical)
