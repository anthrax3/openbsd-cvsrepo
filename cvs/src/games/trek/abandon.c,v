@ANSIfy trek(6)

Note: Binary change is introduced due to function schedule() where its args are
(int,double,char,char,char), but on trek.h are (int,double,int,int,int). Changed
to the latter since the 3 last args are coordinates.

**  Abandon Ship
**
**	The ship is abandoned.  If your current ship is the Faire
**	Queene, or if your shuttlecraft is dead, you're out of
**	luck.  You need the shuttlecraft in order for the captain
**	(that's you!!) to escape.
**
**	Your crew can beam to an inhabited starsystem in the
**	quadrant, if there is one and if the transporter is working.
**	If there is no inhabited starsystem, or if the transporter
**	is out, they are left to die in outer space.
**
**	These currently just count as regular deaths, but they
**	should count very heavily against you.
**
**	If there are no starbases left, you are captured by the
**	Klingons, who torture you mercilessly.  However, if there
**	is at least one starbase, you are returned to the
**	Federation in a prisoner of war exchange.  Of course, this
**	can't happen unless you have taken some prisoners.

@rcsid[] and sccsid[] and copyright[] are essentially unmaintained (and
unmaintainable).  these days, people use source.  these id's do not provide
any benefit, and do hurt the small install media
