.Sh NAME
.Nm dm
.Nd dungeon master
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm ln
.Fl s Cm dm Ar game
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Dm
is a program used to regulate game playing.
.Nm Dm
expects to be invoked with the name of a game that a user wishes to play.
This is done by creating symbolic links to
.Nm dm
in the directory
.Pa /usr/games
for all of the regulated games.
The actual binaries for these games should be placed in a
.Dq hidden
directory,
.Pa /usr/games/hide ,
that may only be accessed by the
.Nm
program.
.Nm Dm
determines if the requested game is available and, if so, runs it.
The file
.Pa /etc/dm.conf
controls the conditions under which games may
be run.
.Pp
The file
.Pa /etc/nogames
may be used to
.Dq turn off
game playing.
If the file exists, no game playing is allowed; the contents of the file
will be displayed to any user requesting a game.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /var/log/games.log -compact
.It Pa /etc/dm.conf
configuration file
.It Pa /etc/nogames
turns off game playing
.It Pa /usr/games/hide
directory of actual binaries
.It Pa /var/log/games.log
game logging file (if logging was compiled in)
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr dm.conf 5
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command appeared in
.Bx 4.3 tahoe .
.Sh SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
Some issues arise from
.Nm
running the games setgid
.Dq games .
All games that allow users to run
.Ux
commands should carefully
set both the real and effective group id's before executing
those commands.
Probably more important is that
.Nm
never be setgid anything but
.Dq games
so that compromising a game will result only in
the user's ability to play games at will.
Also, games which previously had no reason to run setgid and which
accessed user files may have to be modified.

.Sh BUGS
Two problems result from
.Nm dm
running the games setuid
d99 2

First, all games that allow users to run
.Tn UNIX
d102 5
a106 5
set both the real and effective user id's immediately before executing
those commands.  Probably more important is that
.Nm dm
never be setuid
anything but
d109 3
a111 8
the user's ability to play games at will.  Secondly, games which previously
had no reason to run setuid and which accessed user files may have to
be modified.
