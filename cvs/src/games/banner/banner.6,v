.Sh NAME
.Nm banner
.Nd print large banner on printer
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm banner
.Op Fl w Ar width
.Ar message ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
prints a large, high quality banner on the standard output.
If the message is omitted, it prompts for and
reads one line of its standard input.
If
.Fl w
is given, the output is scrunched down from a width of 132 to
.Ar width ,
suitable for a narrow terminal.
.Pp
The output should be printed on a hard-copy device, up to 132 columns wide,
with no breaks between the pages.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr banner 1
.Sh AUTHORS
.An Mark Horton
.Sh BUGS
Several ASCII characters are not defined, notably <, >, [, ], \e,
^, _, {, }, |, and ~.
Also, the characters ", ', and & are funny
looking
.Pq but in a useful way .
.Pp
The
.Fl w
option is implemented by skipping some rows and columns.
The smaller it gets, the grainier the output.
Sometimes it runs letters together.

@- remove all trailing whitespace
     * except when it is escaped with a `\' at the end of the line
- fix remaining .Nm usage as well
- this is from a patch I received from kwesterback@@home.com, who has been
  working on some scripts for fixing formatting errors in mdoc'd man pages

Ok, so there could be a cost/benefit debate with this commit, but since I have
the patch we might as well commit it...

may want
a printer or a fast hardcopy terminal, but if you are patient, a
decwriter or other 300 baud terminal will do.
