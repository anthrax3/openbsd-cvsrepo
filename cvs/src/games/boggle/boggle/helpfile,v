Commands:

Enter word:                 <return> or <linefeed> or <space>
Delete previous character:  <delete> or <backspace>
Delete line:                <^u> or <^w>
Redraw screen:              <^l> or <^r>
Pause game:                 <^s>
Resume game:                <^q> or <^s>
Suspend game:               <^z>
Give up on current cube:    <^d>
Show remaining time:        <space> first thing on a line
Show help:                  ? (Suspends timer until done)
Exit game:                  <^c>

(^u means "control u", etc.)

Any time you are prompted while the board is displayed you can type:
                           <esc>word
to see where "word" is on the board.

Usage:
    boggle [-Bbcd] [-t time] [-w length] [+[+]] [boardspec]

    -B: big boggle mode, uses a 5x5 board
    -b: batch mode (boardspec must be present); dictionary read from stdin
    -c: a challenge cube will be added to the board
    -d: debug mode
    -t time: time limit in seconds instead of default 180
    -w length: minimum word length in letters instead of default 3
    +: can reuse a cube, but not twice in succession
    ++: can reuse cubes arbitrarily
    boardspec: the first board to use (use 'q' for 'qu'); e.g.:
          boggle nolezeebnqieegei
.
                            Default Rules

A Boggle board is a four by four arrangement of Boggle cubes.
You have 3 minutes to find as many words as possible in the Boggle board.
Words are formed by finding a sequence of cubes (letters) that are in the
game's dictionary.  The (N+1)th cube in the word must be horizontally,
vertically, or diagonally adjacent to the Nth cube.  Cubes cannot be reused.
Words consist solely of lower case letters and must be at least 3 letters long.
.
                           Options

Command line flags can be given to change the rules of the game.
The '+' flag allows a cube to be used multiple times, but not in succession.
The '++' flag makes each cube adjacent to itself.
The time limit can be changed from the default 3 minutes by using the
flag '-t time' where 'time' is the duration (in seconds) of each game.
The minimum word length can be changed from 3 letters by specifying
'-w length' where 'length' is the minimum number of letters to use.

@Some of the boggle documentation claimed boggle was under a license more
restrictive than the BSD license.  I talked to the original author,
Barry Brachman <brachman@@dss.bc.ca>, who told me that only the BSD license
was valid--it was an oversight that traces of the older license were not
removed.  He is also no longer soliciting bug reports.

                           Bugs and Limitations

The following bugs and problems are known to exist:

- If there are a great many words in the cube the final display of the words
  may scroll off of the screen.  (On a 25 line screen about 130 words can be
  displayed.)

- Computing the complete word list can be too slow on small machines.

- No word can contain a 'q' that is not immediately followed by a 'u'.

- When using the '+' or '++' options the display of words found in the board
  doesn't indicate reused cubes.
