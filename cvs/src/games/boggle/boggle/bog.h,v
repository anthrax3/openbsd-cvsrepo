@Make the bog code generic enough to handle arbitrary NxN grids and
add cubes for 5x5 mode based on Boggle Deluxe (aka Big Boggle) as
well as support for the "challenge cube" shipped with some versions
of Boggle.  Also Dynamically allocate record keeping structures so
we can deal with large word lists and add a --More-- prompt for
when there are too many wwords found by the computer to fit on the
terminal.  OK deraadt@@
