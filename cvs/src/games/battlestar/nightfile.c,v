@Finding bugs in battlestar is like shooting fish in a barrel.
	Don't overflow beenthere[].  Add "verbose" option.
	Fix spelling (including embedded hyphens in descriptions) and grammar.
	"Kill" will now use the laser if you have no cutting implements.
	Formatting.
	You can do more things to the bathing goddess.
	A little less guess-the-word.  Occasionally better error messages,
particularly with "all" when nothing applies.
	"kick door" no longer segfaults.  Nor does "kill door".
More bugs remain...
