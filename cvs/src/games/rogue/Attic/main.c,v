@Remove rogue.  Its license is not acceptable for our tree;  been
unlinked from the builds for 8 years.  I've been talking with the
author 2 years ago, he didn't release a proper license.  It's clear
that the issue won't be resolved.  OK tedu@@.

@rcsid[] and sccsid[] and copyright[] are essentially unmaintained (and
unmaintainable).  these days, people use source.  these id's do not provide
any benefit, and do hurt the small install media
(the 33,000 line diff is essentially mechanical)
ok with the idea millert, ok dms

@- string handling patch from David Holland, minimally modified.  Highlights
are fewer magic constants, sprintf->snprintf, and better scorefile handling.
Also, won't hang if forking a subshell fails.
- a few needless functions have been trimmed, and a few extra defaults have
been added to a few switches, just in case.
