.Sh NAME
.Nm gomoku
.Nd game of 5 in a row
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm gomoku
.Op Fl bcdu
.Op Fl D Ar debugfile
.Op Ar inputfile
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a two player game where the object is to get 5 in a row horizontally,
vertically or diagonally on a 19 by 19 grid.
By convention, black always moves first.
With no arguments,
.Nm
will display a playing board and prompt for moves from the user.
The interface is visual and straightforward; you move to a spot
using the
.Xr hack 6
motion keys
.Em hjklyubn
and select it with either
.Sq space
or
.Sq return .
The game will beep if you select a location that is already occupied.
To save the game, type
.Sq S
and to quit, type
.Sq Q .
The optional file
.Ar inputfile
can be used to restore a saved game.
.Pp
The options are:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl b
This option sets background mode.
Input moves are read from standard input,
the computer picks a move, and prints it to standard output.
The first input line should be either
.Dq black
or
.Dq white
to specify whether
.Nm
has the first move or not respectively.
This option was intended for game tournaments where a referee program
handles the board display and pits one program against another.
.It Fl c
Computer versus computer.
.Nm
will play a game against itself.
This is mostly used for testing.
.It Fl D Ar debugfile
Print the debug information to
.Ar debugfile
instead of to the standard output.
.It Fl d
Print debugging information.
Repeating this option more than once yields more detailed information.
.It Fl u
User versus user.
This is mostly used for testing.
.El
.Sh AUTHORS
.An Ralph Campbell
.Sh BUGS
The program is far too slow and uses far too much memory for the quality of
game it provides.
.Sh ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
The board display routines were based on the
.Nm goref
program written by Peter Langston.
The user interface was based on Eric S. Raymond's interface to
.Xr bs 6 .

@- remove all trailing whitespace
     * except when it is escaped with a `\' at the end of the line
- fix remaining .Nm usage as well
- this is from a patch I received from kwesterback@@home.com, who has been
  working on some scripts for fixing formatting errors in mdoc'd man pages

Ok, so there could be a cost/benefit debate with this commit, but since I have
the patch we might as well commit it...
