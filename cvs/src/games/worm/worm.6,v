.Sh NAME
.Nm worm
.Nd play the growing worm game
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm worm
.Op Ar size
.Sh DESCRIPTION
In
.Nm worm ,
you are a little worm: your body is the "o"'s on the screen
and your head is the "@@".
You move with the hjkl keys (as in the game
.Xr snake 6 ) .
If you don't press any keys, you continue in the direction you
last moved.
The upper case HJKL keys move you as if you had pressed
several of the corresponding lower case key (9 for HL and 5 for JK, or
until you run into a digit, whichever comes first).
.Pp
On the screen you will see a digit.
If your worm eats the digit it will grow longer by that number of "o"'s,
scaled to screen size.
The object of the game is to see how long you can make the worm grow.
.Pp
The game ends when the worm runs into either the sides of the screen
or itself.
The current score
.Pq how much the worm has grown
is kept in the upper right corner of the screen.
.Pp
The optional argument,
.Ar size ,
is the initial length of the worm's body.
The specified length will be rejected if it causes the worm to cover
more than roughly one third of the screen.

Use strtonum() and error out on an unacceptable length argument rather than
reverting to default values; document maximum initial length limit.

- fix remaining .Nm usage as well
- this is from a patch I received from kwesterback@@home.com, who has been
  working on some scripts for fixing formatting errors in mdoc'd man pages

Ok, so there could be a cost/benefit debate with this commit, but since I have
the patch we might as well commit it...
