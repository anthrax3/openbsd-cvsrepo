@support for Intel 2100/2200BG/2915ABG wireless devices written by
damien.bergamini@@free.fr. This gets imported even though there is no
firmware in the tree.  This is a ridiculous situation: everything is
free, everything works, except Intel will not let us put a little
dinky firmware flat file into OpenBSD.  So OpenBSD is ready for Intel
whenever they are.

Are you a consumer?  Do you want to see this changed -- contact
jketreno@@linux.intel.com and tell him how you feel about this.  He is
likely someone who cannot do anything about it, though.  If anyone can
work up or down the chain around his department and get me contact
information for various people, I will compile and later publish such
a list.  Go do it people -- this is how things will change.  Get me
email addresses and phone numbers.
