.PP
File System Check Program (\fIfsck_ffs\fR)
is an interactive file system check and repair program.
.I Fsck_ffs
uses the redundant structural information in the
UNIX file system to perform several consistency checks.
If an inconsistency is detected, it is reported
to the operator, who may elect to fix or ignore
each inconsistency.
These inconsistencies result from the permanent interruption
of the file system updates, which are performed every
time a file is modified.
Unless there has been a hardware failure,
.I fsck_ffs
is able to repair corrupted file systems
using procedures based upon the order in which UNIX honors
these file system update requests.
.PP
The purpose of this document is to describe the normal updating
of the file system,
to discuss the possible causes of file system corruption,
and to present the corrective actions implemented
by
.I fsck_ffs.
Both the program and the interaction between the
program and the operator are described.
