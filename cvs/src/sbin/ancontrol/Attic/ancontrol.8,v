.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command controls the operation of Aironet wireless networking
devices via the
.Xr an 4
driver.
Most of the parameters that can be changed relate to the
IEEE 802.11 protocol which the Aironet cards implement.
This includes
the station name, whether the station is operating in ad-hoc (point
to point) or infrastructure mode, and the network name of a service
set to join.
.Nm
can also be used to view the current NIC status, configuration,
and to dump the values of the card's statistics counters.
.Pp
The
.Ar interface
argument given to
.Nm
should be the logical interface name associated with the Aironet
device (e.g., an0, an1, etc...).
If no
.Ar interface
is specified,
.Sq an0
is used.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl A
Display the preferred access point list.
The AP list can be used by
stations to specify the MAC address of access points with which it
wishes to associate.
If no AP list is specified (the default) then
the station will associate with the first access point that it finds
which serves the SSID(s) specified in the SSID list.
The AP list can
be modified with the
.Fl a
option.
.It Xo
.Op Fl v Ar 1|2|3|4
.Fl a Ar AP
.Xc
Set preferred access point.
The
.Ar AP
is specified as a MAC address consisting of 6 hexadecimal values
separated by colons.
By default, the
.Fl a
option only sets the first entry in the
.Ar AP
list.
The
.Fl v
modifier can be used to specify exactly which
.Ar AP
list entry is to be modified.
If the
.Fl v
flag is not used, the first
.Ar AP
list entry will be changed.
.It Fl b Ar beacon_period
Set the ad-hoc mode beacon period.
The beacon period is specified in
milliseconds.
The default is 100ms.
.It Fl C
Display current NIC configuration.
This shows the current operation mode,
receive mode, MAC address, power save settings, various timing settings,
channel selection, diversity, transmit power, and transmit speed.
.It Fl c Ar channel
Set the radio frequency of a given interface.
The frequency
should be specified as a channel ID as shown in the table below.
The
list of available frequencies is dependent on radio regulations specified
by regional authorities.
Recognized regulatory authorities include
the FCC (United States), ETSI (Europe), France, and Japan.
Frequencies
in the table are specified in MHz.

.Ed
.Pp
If an illegal channel is specified, the
NIC will revert to its default channel.
For NICs sold in the United States
and Europe, the default channel is 3.
For NICs sold in France, the default channel is 11.
For NICs sold in Japan, the only available channel is 14.
Note that two stations must be set to the same channel in order to
communicate.
.It Fl v Ar "0|1" Fl d Ar "0|1|2|3"
Select the antenna diversity.
Aironet devices can be configured with up
to two antennas, and transmit and receive diversity can be configured
accordingly.
Valid selections are as follows:
.Bd -filled -offset indent
.Bl -column "Selection " "Diversity "
.Em "Selection	Diversity"
0	Select factory default diversity
1	Antenna 1 only
2	Antenna 2 only
3	Antenna 1 and 2
.El
.Ed
.Pp
The receive and transmit diversity can be set independently.
The user
must specify which diversity setting is to be modified by using the
.Fl v
option: selection
.Ar 0
sets the receive diversity and
.Ar 1
sets the transmit diversity.
.It Fl e Ar "0|1|2|3"
Set the transmit WEP key to use.
Note that until this command is issued, the device will use the
last key programmed.
The transmit key is stored in NVRAM.
The currently set transmit key can be checked via
.Fl C
option.
.It Fl f Ar fragmentation_threshold
Set the fragmentation threshold in bytes.
This threshold controls the
point at which outgoing packets will be split into multiple fragments.
If a single fragment is not sent successfully, only that fragment will
need to be retransmitted instead of the whole packet.
The fragmentation
threshold can be anything from 64 to 2312 bytes.
The default is 2312.
.It Fl h
Prints a list of available options and sample usage.
.It Fl I
Display NIC capability information.
This shows the device type,
frequency, speed, power level capabilities, and firmware revision levels.
.It Fl j Ar netjoin_timeout
Set the ad-hoc network join timeout.
When a station is first activated
in ad-hoc mode, it will search out a
.Dq master
station with the desired SSID and associate with it.
If the station is unable to locate another
station with the same SSID after a suitable timeout, it sets itself up
as the master so that other stations may associate with it.
This
timeout defaults to 10000 milliseconds (10 seconds) but may be changed
with this option.
The timeout should be specified in milliseconds.
.It Fl K Ar "0|1|2"
Set authorization type.
Use 0 for none, 1 for "Open", 2 for "Shared Key".
.It Fl v Ar "0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7" Fl k Ar key
Set a WEP key.
For 40 bits, prefix 10 hex digits with 0x.
For 128 bits, prefix 26 hex digits with 0x.
Use "" as the key to erase it.
Supports 4 keys; even numbers are for permanent keys
and odd numbers are for temporary keys.
For example, "-v 1" sets the first temporary key.
(A "permanent" key is stored in NVRAM; a "temporary" key is not.)
Note that the device will use the most recently-programmed key
by default.
Currently set keys can be checked via the
.Fl C
option; only the sizes of the keys are returned.
.It Fl l Ar station_name
Set the station name used internally by the NIC.
.Ar station_name
can be any text string up to 16 characters in length.
The default name
is set by the driver to
.Qq OpenBSD .
.It Fl m Ar macaddress
Set the station address for the specified interface.
The
.Ar macaddress
is specified as a series of six hexadecimal values separated by colons,
e.g. 00:60:1d:12:34:56.
This programs the new address into the card
and updates the interface as well.
.It Fl N
Display the SSID list.
This is a list of service set IDs (i.e., network names)
with which the station wishes to associate.
There may be up to three SSIDs
in the list: the station will go through the list in ascending order and
associate with the first matching SSID that it finds.
.It Xo
.Op Fl v Ar 1|2|3
.Fl n Ar SSID
.Xc
Set the desired SSID (network name).
There are three SSIDs which allows
the NIC to work with access points at several locations without needing
to be reconfigured.
The NIC checks each SSID in sequence when searching
for a match.
The SSID to be changed can be specified with the
.Fl v
modifier option.
If the
.Fl v
flag isn't used, the first SSID in the list is set.
.It Fl o Ar 0|1
Set the operating mode of the Aironet interface.
Valid selections are
.Ar 0
for ad-hoc mode and
.Ar 1
for infrastructure mode.
The default driver setting is for infrastructure mode.
.It Fl p Ar tx_power
Set the transmit power level in milliwatts.
Valid power settings
vary depending on the actual NIC and can be viewed by dumping the
device capabilities with the
.Fl I
flag.
Typical values are 1, 5, 20, 50, and 100mW.
Selecting 0 sets
the factory default.
.It Fl Q
If driver was compiled with option
.Nm ANCACHE
(default) then display the signal cache contents.
A maximum of 16 station addresses are collected on the list
with LRU expiration policy.
Information such as MAC address, IP address, and signal strength
is collected from the most recent matching packet received.
.It Fl r Ar RTS_threshold
Set the RTS/CTS threshold for a given interface.
This controls the
number of bytes used for the RTS/CTS handshake boundary.
The
.Ar RTS_threshold
can be any value between 0 and 2312.
The default is 2312.
.It Fl S
Display NIC status information.
This includes the current operating
status, current BSSID, SSID, channel, beacon period, and currently
associated access point.
The operating mode indicates the state of
the NIC, MAC status, and receiver status.
When the
.Dq synced
keyword appears, it means the NIC has successfully associated with an access
point, associated with an ad-hoc
.Dq master
station, or become a
.Dq master
itself.
The beacon period can be anything between 20 and 976 milliseconds.
The default is 100.
.It Fl s Ar 0|1|2|3
Set power save mode.
Valid selections are as follows:
.Bd -filled -offset indent
.Bl -column "Selection " "Power save mode "
.Em "Selection	Power save mode"
0	None \- power save disabled
1	Constantly awake mode (CAM)
2	Power Save Polling (PSP)
3	Fast Power Save Polling (PSP-CAM)
.El
.Ed
.Pp
Note that for IBSS (ad-hoc) mode, only PSP mode is supported, and only
if the ATIM window is non-zero.
.It Fl T
Display the NIC's internal statistics counters.
.It Fl t Ar 0|1|2|3|4
Select transmit speed.
The available settings are as follows:
.Bd -filled -offset indent
.Bl -column "TX rate " "NIC speed "
.Em "TX rate	NIC speed"
0	Auto -- NIC selects optimal speed
1	1Mbps fixed
2	2Mbps fixed
3	5.5Mbps fixed
4	11Mbps fixed
.El
.Ed
.Pp
Note that the 5.5 and 11Mbps settings are only supported on the 4800
series adapters: the 4500 series adapters have a maximum speed of 2Mbps.
.It Fl W Ar "0|1|2"
Enable WEP.
Use 0 for no WEP, 1 to enable full WEP, 2 for mixed cell.
.It Fl Z
Purge the signal cache contents (see above).
.El
.Sh SECURITY NOTES
WEP ("wired equivalent privacy") is based on the RC4 algorithm,
using a 24-bit initialization vector.
.Pp
RC4 is supposedly vulnerable to certain known plaintext attacks,
especially with 40-bit keys.
So the security of WEP in part depends on how much known plaintext
is transmitted.
.Pp
Because of this, although counter-intuitive, using "shared key"
authentication (which involves sending known plaintext) is less
secure than using "open" authentication when WEP is enabled.
.Pp
Devices may alternate among all of the configured WEP keys when
transmitting packets.
Therefore, all configured keys (up to four) must agree.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command first appeared in
.Fx 3.0
and
.Ox 2.7 .
.Sh AUTHORS
.An -nosplit
The
.Nm
command was written by
.An Bill Paul Aq wpaul@@ee.columbia.edu
and ported to
.Ox
by
.An Michael Shalayeff Aq mickey@@openbsd.org .
.Sh BUGS
The statistics counters do not seem to show the amount of transmit
and received frames as increasing.
This is likely due to the fact that
the
.Xr an 4
driver uses unmodified packet mode instead of letting the NIC perform
802.11/Ethernet encapsulation itself.
.Pp
Setting the channel does not seem to have any effect.

.It Fl W Ar "0|1|2"
Enable WEP.
Use 0 for no WEP, 1 to enable full WEP, 2 for mixed cell.
.It Fl j Ar netjoin timeout
Set the ad-hoc network join timeout.
When a station is first activated
in ad-hoc mode, it will search out a 'master' station with the desired
SSID and associate with it.
If the station is unable to locate another
station with the same SSID after a suitable timeout, it sets itself up
as the 'master' so that other stations may associate with it.
This
timeout defaults to 10000 milliseconds (10 seconds) but may be changed
with this option.
The timeout should be specified in milliseconds.

.It Fl c Ar channel
Set the radio frequency of a given interface.
The
.Ar frequency
should be specified as a channel ID as shown in the table below.
The
list of available frequencies is dependent on radio regulations specified
by regional authorities.
Recognized regulatory authorities include
the FCC (United States), ETSI (Europe), France, and Japan.
Frequencies
in the table are specified in Mhz.

If an illegal channel is specified, the
NIC will revert to its default channel.
For NICs sold in the United States
and Europe, the default channel is 3.
For NICs sold in France, the default channel is 11.
For NICs sold in Japan, the only available channel is 14.
Note that two stations must be set to the same channel in order to
communicate.
.It Fl f Ar fragmentation threshold
Set the fragmentation threshold in bytes.
This threshold controls the
point at which outgoing packets will be split into multiple fragments.
If a single fragment is not sent successfully, only that fragment will
need to be retransmitted instead of the whole packet.
The fragmentation
threshold can be anything from 64 to 2312 bytes.
The default is 2312.
