.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm mount_ados
.Nd mount an AmigaDOS file system
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm mount_ados
.Op Fl g Ar gid
.Op Fl m Ar mask
.Op Fl o Ar options
.Op Fl u Ar uid
.Ar special
.Ar node
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command attaches the AmigaDOS filesystem residing on
the device
.Ar special
to the global filesystem namespace at the location
indicated by
.Ar node .
This command is invoked by
.Xr mount 8
when using the syntax
.Bd -ragged -offset 4n
.Nm mount Op options
-t ados
.Ar special Ar node
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Ar special
device must correspond to a partition registered in the
.Xr disklabel 5 .
.Pp
.Xr mount 8
is normally run at boot time, but can be used by any user to mount an
AmigaDOS file system on any directory that they own (provided,
of course, that they have appropriate access to the device that
contains the file system).
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl g Ar gid
Set the group of the files in the file system to
.Ar gid .
The default group is the group of the directory
on which the file system is being mounted.
.It Fl m Ar mask
Specify the maximum file permissions for files
in the file system.
(For example, a mask of
.Li 755
specifies that, by default, the owner should have
read, write, and execute permissions for files, but
others should only have read and execute permissions.
See
.Xr chmod 1
for more information about octal file modes.)
Only the nine low-order bits of
.Ar mask
are used.
The default mask is taken from the
directory on which the file system is being mounted.
.It Fl o Ar options
Use the specified mount
.Ar options ,
as described in
.Xr mount 8 .
.It Fl u Ar uid
Set the owner of the files in the file system to
.Ar uid .
The default owner is the owner of the directory
on which the file system is being mounted.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr mount 2 ,
.Xr disklabel 5 ,
.Xr fstab 5 ,
.Xr disklabel 8 ,
.Xr mount 8 ,
.Xr umount 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
utility first appeared in
.Nx 0.9 b.
.Sh CAVEATS
The
.Li ados
filesystem currently supports the Amiga fast file system.
