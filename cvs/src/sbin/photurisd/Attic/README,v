@This is an implementation of the Photuris keymanagement protocol
according to the drafts:
	draft-simpson-photuris-18.txt
	draft-simpson-photuris-schemes-04.txt

For quick installation instructions read INSTALL, or otherwise
README.howtouse for more complete information.

At the moment only the PF_ENCAP kernel interface for John Ioannidis'
and Angelos D. Keromytis' IPsec as to be found in OpenBSD is supported.
It should be fairly easy to adapt the daemon to other implementations,
just look at the sections found by 'grep IPSEC *.c'

I am grateful for the help provided by Angelos D. Keromytis
and Theo de Raadt.

This software was written in Germany May 1997 by Niels Provos.
Any questions are welcome at provos@@physnet.uni-hamburg.de
