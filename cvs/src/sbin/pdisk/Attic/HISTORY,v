@A short history of pdisk
------------------------
11/1996 -	Spent a week to create a minimal partitioner
		that reads maps, initializes maps, can add and delete partitions.
		Released as version 0.1 to MkLinux team

		and a couple of flags to private version.
		
07/1997 - 	Some one else ported it to Rhapsody.
		Spent a couple of weeks adding variable block
		size support to Rhapsody version.
		Took the time to stop using rich man's source code control
		(multiple copies) in linux/mac and put sources under RCS.

01/1998 -	Added media iterators (to fix grunge in dump.c)
		Added os_reload_media (to get rid of ioctl's in write_partition_map)
		Added rename partition command ('n' in edit mode)
		Added /dev/hd? and /dev/scd? to MkLinux list all disks
		Added 68k target to CW project

02/1998 -	Released version 0.6
		Added support for ATA/IDE disks without LBA capability
		Fixed bug - create partition with unmodified size failed
		Added support for new (DR3) MkLinux names - show MkLinux
		name when displaying under another name and allow the
		MkLinux name to be used on input.
		Released version 0.7

02-04/2000 -	Clean up sources - fix naming, delete old email addresses
		Added support for display of Mac volume names
		Added cvt_pt target (for LinuxPPC team)
		Fix block 0 display to show logical offset of drivers
		Require confirmation of quit without write
		Fix iteration to not complain about missing devices
		Warn when creating/writing a map with more than 15 entries
		Make initial window larger in Mac version
		Fix ATA support to scan buses correctly
		Fix linux names (in MacOS) to work correctly with many devices
		Change so WORM devices are considered 'CDs'

05/2000 - 	Released version 0.8

log
@update for pdisk 0.8a2, from NetBSD, retaining our local changes;
summing it up:

- Clean up sources - fix naming, delete old email addresses
- Added support for display of Mac volume names
- Fix block 0 display to show logical offset of drivers
- Require confirmation of quit without write
- Fix iteration to not complain about missing devices
- Warn when creating/writing a map with more than 15 entries

and, most important, add do_update_dpme() which allows us to partition
OpenBSD slices without previous MacOS setup.

Tested with shared MacOS install on macppc, procedure there remains the
same.
