 * A version is of the form:	N.M{.X}{yZ}
 *
 * 	N is two digits indicating the major version
 *	M is a single digit indicating relative revision
 *	X is a single digit indicating a bug fix revision
 *	y is a character from the set [dab] indicating stage (dev,alpha,beta)
 *	Z is two digits indicating the delta within the stage
 *
 * Note that within the 'vers' resource all these fields end up
 * comprising a four byte unsigned integer with the property that any later
 * version will be represented by a larger number.

@update for pdisk 0.8a2, from NetBSD, retaining our local changes;
summing it up:

- Clean up sources - fix naming, delete old email addresses
- Added support for display of Mac volume names
- Fix block 0 display to show logical offset of drivers
- Require confirmation of quit without write
- Fix iteration to not complain about missing devices
- Warn when creating/writing a map with more than 15 entries

and, most important, add do_update_dpme() which allows us to partition
OpenBSD slices without previous MacOS setup.

Tested with shared MacOS install on macppc, procedure there remains the
same.
