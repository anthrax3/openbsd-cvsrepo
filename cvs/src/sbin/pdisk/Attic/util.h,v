@With last pdisk and full functionality for mac68k now in place, start
cleaning the maze of ifdef's not relevant for us.

This round wipes most linux and/or MacOS-only bits, more to come.

@update for pdisk 0.8a2, from NetBSD, retaining our local changes;
summing it up:

- Clean up sources - fix naming, delete old email addresses
- Added support for display of Mac volume names
- Fix block 0 display to show logical offset of drivers
- Require confirmation of quit without write
- Fix iteration to not complain about missing devices
- Warn when creating/writing a map with more than 15 entries

and, most important, add do_update_dpme() which allows us to partition
OpenBSD slices without previous MacOS setup.

Tested with shared MacOS install on macppc, procedure there remains the
same.
