.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm mknod
.Nd make device special files
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm mknod
.Op Fl m Ar mode
.Ar name
.Cm b Ns | Ns Cm c
.Ar major minor
.Nm mknod
.Op Fl m Ar mode
.Ar name
.Cm p
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command creates device special files.
Normally the shell script
.Pa /dev/MAKEDEV
is used to create special files for commonly known devices; it executes
.Nm
with the appropriate arguments and can make all the files required for the
device.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl m Ar mode
Set the file permission bits of newly created device special files to
.Ar mode .
The mode argument can be in any of the formats specified to the
.Xr chmod 1
utility.
If a symbolic mode is specified, the operators
.Ql +
and
.Ql -
are interpreted relative to an initial mode of
.Dq a=rw .
.El
.Pp
To make nodes manually, the arguments are:
.Bl -tag -width majorx
.It Ar name
Device or FIFO name.
For example
.Dq sd
for a SCSI disk or a
.Dq pty
for pseudo-devices.
FIFOs may be named arbitrarily by the user.
.It Cm b | c | p
Type of device or FIFO.
If the device is a block type device such as a tape or disk drive which needs
both cooked and raw special files,
the type is
.Cm b .
All other devices are character type devices, such as terminal
and pseudo devices, and are type
.Cm c .
A FIFO (also known as a named pipe) is type
.Cm p .
.It Ar major
The major device number is an integer number which tells the kernel
which device driver entry point to use.
To learn what major device number to use for a particular device,
check the file
.Pa /dev/MAKEDEV
to see if the device is known.
.It Ar minor
The minor device number tells the kernel which subunit
the node corresponds to on the device; for example,
a subunit may be a filesystem partition
or a tty line.
.Pp
Major and minor device numbers can be given in any format acceptable to
.Xr strtoul 3 ,
so that a leading
.Dq 0x
indicates a hexadecimal number, and a leading
.Dq 0
will cause the number to be interpreted as octal.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr chmod 1 ,
.Xr mkfifo 1 ,
.Xr mkfifo 2 ,
.Xr mknod 2 ,
.Xr MAKEDEV 8
.Sh STANDARDS
As an extension,
.Nm
can also take multiple lists of parameters in one go.
Note that
.Fl m
is not reset from one list to the next so, for example, in
.Pp
.Dl mknod -m 700 name b 12 5 name2 b 12 6
.Pp
both
.Ar name
and
.Ar name2
will be mode 700.
.Sh HISTORY
A
.Nm
command appeared in
.At v4 .

1.21
log
@Almost complete rewrite of mknod.

With this, none of the original code survives, so the Copyright notice
can be changed accordingly.

This does pledge upfront, because having fifos or devices with
setuid/gid/sticky makes no sense anyway.

The reorganization was done to allow a "create multiple devices" at once
mode, in order to speed up MAKEDEV (eventually) now that the ksh builtin
is gone.  The code is picky and checks all parameters before doing anything.

Inputs from natano, deraadt, rpe, millert, tb, jmc...

@Reduce usage of predefined strings in manpages.

Predefined strings are not very portable across troff implementations,
and they make the source much harder to read. Usually the intended
character can be written directly.

No output changes, except for two instances where the incorrect escape
was used in the first place.

@i saw the previous was wrong as soon as i committed it: put the
built-in blurb in STANDARDS; we did once have a COMPATIBILITY section
which we merged with STANDARDS, so i think this is appropriate. it
certainly feels better than adding single sentences randomly to the
