.Nm dhclient.leases
.Nd DHCP client lease database
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Xr dhclient 8
keeps a persistent database of leases that it has acquired that are still
valid.
The database is a free-form ASCII file containing one valid declaration
per lease.
The file is written as a log, so the last declaration is the most recent
lease obtained.
.Pp
The lease file is named
.Pa /var/db/dhclient.leases. Ns Aq Ar IFNAME ,
where
.Qq IFNAME
represents the network interface
.Xr dhclient 8
acquired the lease on.
For example, if
.Xr dhclient 8
is configured for the em0 network device,
the lease file will be named
.Pa /var/db/dhclient.leases.em0 ,
.Pp
The format of the lease declarations is described in
.Xr dhclient.conf 5 .
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width "/var/db/dhclient.leases.IFNAME   "
.It Pa /var/db/dhclient.leases. Ns Aq Ar IFNAME ,
Current lease file.

If more than one declaration appears for a given lease,
