.Nm boot
.Nd
system bootstrapping procedures
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Ss Power fail and crash recovery
Normally, the system will reboot itself at power-up or after crashes.
An automatic consistency check of the file systems will be performed,
and unless this fails, the system will resume multi-user operations.
.Pp
.Ss Cold starts
The X68000/X68030 system boots from the device
which is determined by the configuration of
battery-backuped SRAM.
By default, the boot ROM attempts to boot from a
floppy disk drive (from 0 to 3) first,
and then from a hard disk (SASI or SCSI).
On the OpenBSD/X68k, booting from partition
.Dq a
of SCSI disks (sd?a)
and 2HD floppy disks (fd?a, fd?c) is currently supported.
.Pp
First, the initial program loader of IOCS ROM or SCSI disk
(or equivalent) reads the
.Nm boot
program at the top of the disk,
and then the
.Nm boot
program loads the
.Ox
kernel
.Pa /bsd
which is in the same partition of the disk.
If you press the
.Sq SHIFT
key when booting, the boot program enables you to change the
boot flag
.Dv RB_SINGLE
with the
.Sq SHIFT
key, and to choose which kernel
to be used with arrow keys.
If the LED of the
.Sq HIRAGANA
key is turned on, the boot program adds the
.Dv RB_KDB
flag and tries to boot the system in debug mode; see
.Xr ddb 8
for details.
.Pp
Note for X68030+MC68030 systems:
Nothing special to be attended to; you can boot
.Ox
just like as
other operating systems such as Human68k and OS-9.
.Pp
Note for X68030/040turbo(68040 accelerator by BEEPs) systems:
.Ox
can boot under 040 mode.
It can also boot under 030 mode if you have an MC68030 on the board.
.Pp
Note for X68000/Xellent30(68030 accelerator by TSR) + MC68030 systems:
In order to boot
.Ox ,
you must choose 030 mode by using
.Pa CH30.SYS ,
which must reside in the battery-backuped SRAM.
.Pp
Note for X68000/Jupiter-X(68040/060 accelerator by FTZ-net) systems:
The system must be in 040/060 processor mode.
