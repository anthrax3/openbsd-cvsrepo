.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm boot
.Nd
system bootstrapping procedures
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Ss Power fail and crash recovery
When the
.Ox
kernel is booted normally (using one of the two methods discussed below),
it initializes itself and proceeds to boot the system.
An automatic
consistency check of the file systems takes place, and unless this
fails, the system comes up to multi-user operations.
The proper way to shut the system down is with the
.Xr shutdown 8
command.
.Pp
If the system crashes, it will enter the kernel debugger,
.Xr ddb 8 ,
if it is configured in the kernel.
If the debugger is not present
or has exited, the system will attempt a dump to the
configured dump device (which will be automatically recovered with
.Xr savecore 8
during the next boot cycle).
After the dump completes (successful
or not), the system will attempt a reboot.
.Pp
.Ss Booting OpenBSD using the bootloader
When a bootable
.Ox
partition is created by means of
.Xr installboot 8 ,
the Atari BIOS will automatically start the
.Ox
bootloader.
By default, it will load the kernel image
.Pa /bsd
and attempt to boot it into multi-user mode.
This behaviour can be changed by either keeping the
.Sq Alternate
or
.Sq Right-Shift
key pressed during the boot process.
When the
.Sq Alternate
key is pressed, the bootstrap is aborted, causing the BIOS
to continue scanning the disks for a bootable partition (this is compatible
with AHDI 3.0).
Pressing the
.Sq Right-Shift
key during the boot causes the bootloader to enter interactive mode.
In interactive mode, the command line looks like:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Op Ar OS-type
.Op Ar boot-path
.Op Ar boot-options
.Ed
.Pp
Each component of the command can be omitted in which case the defaults
indicated will be used.
.Bl -tag -width
.It OS-type:
.Bl -tag -compact -width ".OpenBSD (default)"
.It .OpenBSD (the default)
.It .linux
.It .asv
.It .tos
.El
.Pp
If something other than
.Pa .OpenBSD
is specified, control is returned to the BIOS with the boot preference set to
the selected type.
Due to limitations of the BIOS, however, the search for
bootblocks is continued rather than restarted.
.It Em boot-path
This gives you the opportunity to boot another kernel, say:
.Pa /bsd.old .
The default is
.Pa /bsd .
.It Em boot-options
These options are a subset of the
.Xr loadbsd
options.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width flag -compact
.It Fl a
Boot into multi-user mode (the default).
.It Fl b
Ask for a root device.
.It Fl d
Enter the kernel debugger.
.El
.El
.Pp
.Ss Booting using the loadbsd program
When you want (or have to) start
.Ox
from GEM, you have to use the
.Xr loadbsd
program that is supplied on the kernel-floppy.
The
.Xr loadbsd
command line
specification is:
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Nm loadbsd
.Op Fl abdhstwDV
.Op Fl S Ar amount
.Op Fl T Ar amount
.Ar kernel-path
.Ed
.Pp
Description of options:
.Bl -tag -width flag
.It Fl a
Boot automatically into multi-user mode.
.It Fl b
Ask for the root device the kernel must use.
.It Fl d
Enter the kernel debugger after booting.
.It Fl h
Print a help screen that tries to explain the same options as mentioned
here.
.It Fl o Ar outputfile
Write all output to the file
.Ar outputfile .
.It Fl s
Tell
.Ox
only to use ST compatible RAM.
.It Fl t
Test loading of the kernel but don't start
.Ox .
.It Fl w
Wait for a keypress before exiting loadbsd.
This is useful when starting this program under GEM.
.It Fl D
Show debugging output while booting the kernel.
.It Fl S Ar amount
Set the amount of available ST compatible RAM in bytes.
Normally this
value is set automatically from the values initialized by the BIOS.
.It Fl T Ar amount
Set the amount of available TT compatible RAM in bytes.
Normally this
value is set automatically from the values initialized by the BIOS.
.It Fl V
Print the version of
.Xr loadbsd
that you are using.
.It Ar kernel-path
This is a GEMDOS path specification of the kernel to boot.
.El
.Pp
Note: Because the loadbsd program can only read kernels from a GEMDOS
filesystem, the file
.Pa /bsd
is usually not the same as the actual kernel booted.
This can cause some programs to fail.
