log
@fsck_vnd just serves no real purpose, so remove it.
enabling fs_passno in fstab for vnd-type filesystems will lead to an error,
just like for the other filesystem types where fsck_something does not exist

@introduce {fsck,mount}_vnd tools to be able to describe vnd images
in /etc/fstab instead of using some weird homegrown scripts.
No support for boot time mounting yet, so "noauto" is still needed.
