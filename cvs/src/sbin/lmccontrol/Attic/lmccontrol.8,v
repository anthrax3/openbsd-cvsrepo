.Sh NAME
.Nm lmccontrol
.Nd configure Lan Media Corporation SSI/HSSI/T1/T3 devices
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm lmccontrol
.Op Fl CcEeKkOoSs
.Op Fl l Ar speed
.Op Ar interface
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command controls the operation of the Lan Media devices via the
.Xr lmc 4
driver.
Most of the parameters that can be changed relate to the
line characteristics or layer 2 protocol options.
You can adjust layer 2 protocol keepalives, and line speed.
Line characteristics which can be adjusted include CRC length,
internal or external clock source, DS3 scrambler, and DS3 cable length.
.Pp
This program controls the Lan Media SSI, HSSI, T1, and DS3 network interfaces.
The SSI is the LMC1000, and runs at various speeds up to 10Mbps.
It requires an external CSU/DSU for operation on T1/E1 lines.
The HSSI card is the LMC5000, and runs at various speeds up to 52Mbps.
It requires an external DSU for operation on DS3 lines.
The DS3 is the LMC5245 and runs at a speed of 45Mbps.
It has no internal clock generator, and does not require external
DSU for DS3 operation.
The T1 card is the LMC1200 and runs at a speed of 1.544Mbps or
2Mbps for E1 operation, without CSU/DSU.
.Pp
The
.Nm
command given without any additional flags retrieves the current card
settings from the driver and prints them out.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl C
Set the interface to use internal clocking.
On the SSI card this uses the internal baud rate generator.
On the HSSI card it uses the PCI bus clock.
This is only valid for SSI/HSSI cards.
.It Fl c
Sets the interface to use an external clock source.
This is only valid for SSI/HSSI cards.
.It Fl E
Sets 32-bit CRC.
.It Fl e
Sets 16-bit CRC.
.It Fl K
Disables layer 2 keepalive.
.It Fl k
Enables layer 2 keepalive.
.It Fl l Ar speed
To manually specify line speed, in bits per second (for devices without
built-in CSU/DSU).
.It Fl O
Program the DS3 card for cable length for over 100 feet in length (higher
power).
.It Fl o
Program the DS3 card for cable lengths of less than 100 feet.
In this mode, the card uses lower power to transmit data for short cable runs,
which might otherwise overdrive a receiver.
This is the default, and will work in most situations even with runs
more than 100 feet.
.It Fl S
Turn DS3 scrambler on.
.It Fl s
Turn DS3 scrambler off.
.It Ar interface
The interface name of the Lan Media card (default is lmc0).
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
Set an SSI card for a speed of 2048000 bits/sec with HDLC keepalive off:
.Pp
.Dl # lmccontrol lmc0 -l 2048000 -K
