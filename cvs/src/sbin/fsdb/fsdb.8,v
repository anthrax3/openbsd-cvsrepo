.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm fsdb
.Nd FFS debugging/editing tool
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm fsdb
.Op Fl d
.Fl f Ar fsname
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
opens
.Ar fsname
(usually a raw disk partition) and runs a command loop
allowing manipulation of the file system's inode data.
You are prompted to enter a command with
.Ic "fsdb (inum X)>"
where
.Va X
is the currently selected i-number.
The initial selected inode is the root of the file system (i-number 2).
.Pp
The command processor uses the
.Xr editline 3
library, so you can use command line editing to reduce typing if desired.
When you exit the command loop, the file system superblock is marked
dirty and any buffered blocks are written to the file system.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl d
Enables additional debugging output (which comes primarily from
.Xr fsck 8 Ns -derived
code).
.It Fl f Ar fsname
Open file system
.Ar fsname .
.El
.Pp
Besides the built-in
.Xr editline 3
commands,
.Nm
supports these commands:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width indent -compact
.It Cm help
Print out the list of accepted commands.
.Pp
.It Cm inode Ar i-number
Select inode
.Ar i-number
as the new current inode.
.Pp
.It Cm back
Revert to the previously current inode.
.Pp
.It Cm clri Ar i-number
Clear the inode
.Ar i-number .
.Pp
.It Cm lookup Ar name , Cm cd Ar name
Find
.Ar name
in the current directory and make its inode the current inode.
.Ar Name
may be a multi-component name or may begin with slash to indicate that
the root inode should be used to start the lookup.
If some component
along the pathname is not found, the last valid directory encountered is
left as the active inode.
.Pp
This command is valid only if the starting inode is a directory.
.Pp
.It Cm active , Cm print
Print out the active inode.
.Pp
.It Cm uplink
Increment the active inode's link count.
.Pp
.It Cm downlink
Decrement the active inode's link count.
.Pp
.It Cm linkcount Ar number
Set the active inode's link count to
.Ar number .
.Pp
.It Cm ls
List the current inode's directory entries.
This command is valid only if the current inode is a directory.
.Pp
.It Cm rm Ar name , Cm del Ar name
Remove the entry
.Ar name
from the current directory inode.
This command is valid only if the current inode is a directory.
.Pp
.It Cm ln Ar ino Ar name
Create a link to inode
.Ar ino
under the name
.Ar name
in the current directory inode.
This command is valid only if the current inode is a directory.
.Pp
.It Cm chinum Ar dirslot Ar inum
Change the i-number in directory entry
.Ar dirslot
to
.Ar inum .
.Pp
.It Cm chname Ar dirslot Ar name
Change the name in directory entry
.Ar dirslot
to
.Ar name .
This command cannot expand a directory entry.
You can only rename an
entry if the name will fit into the existing directory slot.
.Pp
.It Cm chtype Ar type
Change the type of the current inode to
.Ar type .
.Ar type
may be one of:
.Em file ,
.Em dir ,
.Em socket ,
or
.Em fifo .
.Pp
.It Cm chmod Ar mode
Change the mode bits of the current inode to
.Ar mode .
You cannot change the file type with this subcommand; use
.Ic chtype
to do that.
.Pp
.It Cm chflags Ar flags
Change the file flags of the current inode to
.Ar flags .
.Pp
.It Cm chown Ar uid
Change the owner of the current inode to
.Ar uid .
.Pp
.It Cm chlen Ar length
Change the length of the current inode to
.Ar length .
.Pp
.It Cm chgrp Ar gid
Change the group of the current inode to
.Ar gid .
.Pp
.It Cm chgen Ar gen
Change the generation number of the current inode to
.Ar gen .
.Pp
.It Xo Cm mtime Ar time ,
.Cm ctime Ar time ,
.Cm atime Ar time
.Xc
Change the modification, change, or access time (respectively) on the
current inode to
.Ar time .
.Ar Time
should be in the format
.Em YYYYMMDDHHMMSS[.nsec]
where
.Em nsec
is an optional nanosecond specification.
If no nanoseconds are specified, the
.Va mtimensec ,
.Va ctimensec ,
or
.Va atimensec
field will be set to zero.
.Pp
.It Xo Cm quit ,
.Cm q , Cm exit, Em <EOF>
.Xc
Exit the program.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr editline 3 ,
.Xr fs 5 ,
.Xr clri 8 ,
.Xr fsck 8
.Sh HISTORY
.Nm
uses the source code for
.Xr fsck 8
to implement most of the file system manipulation code.
The remainder of
.Nm
first appeared in
.Nx 1.1 .
.Sh BUGS
Manipulation of
.Dq short
symlinks doesn't work (in particular, don't
try changing a symlink's type).
.Pp
You must specify modes as numbers rather than symbolic names.
.Pp
There are a bunch of other things that you might want to do which
.Nm
doesn't implement.
.Sh WARNING
Use this tool with extreme caution \(en you can damage an FFS file system
beyond what
.Xr fsck 8
can repair.

log
@First pass at removing clauses 3 and 4 from NetBSD licenses.

Not sure what's more surprising: how long it took for NetBSD to
catch up to the rest of the BSDs (including UCB), or the amount of
code that NetBSD has claimed for itself without attributing to the
actual authors.
