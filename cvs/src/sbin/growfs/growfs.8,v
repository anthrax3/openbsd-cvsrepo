.Sh NAME
.Nm growfs
.Nd grow size of an existing ffs file system
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl Nqy
.Op Fl s Ar size
.Ar special
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility extends the
.Xr newfs 8
program.
Before starting
.Nm growfs ,
the partition must be set to a larger size using
.Xr disklabel 8 .
The
.Nm
utility extends the size of the file system on the specified special file.
.Pp
Currently
.Nm
can only enlarge unmounted file systems.
Do not try enlarging a mounted file system \- your system may panic and
you will not be able to use the file system any longer.
Most of the
.Xr newfs 8
options cannot be changed by
.Nm growfs .
In fact, you can only increase the size of the file system.
Use
.Xr tunefs 8
for other changes.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width "-s sizeXX"
.It Fl N
Test mode.
Causes the new file system parameters to be printed out without actually
enlarging the file system.
.It Fl q
Operate in quiet mode.
With this option,
.Nm
will not print extraneous information like superblock backups.
.It Fl s Ar size
Determines the
.Ar size
of the file system after enlarging in sectors.
This value defaults to the size of the raw partition specified in
.Ar special
(in other words,
.Nm
will enlarge the file system to the size of the entire partition).
.It Fl y
Expert mode.
Usually
.Nm
will ask you if you have taken a backup of your data and will test
whether
.Ar special
is currently mounted.
The
.Fl y
flag suppresses this,
so use this option with great care!
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width COLUMNS
.It Ev COLUMNS
If set to a positive integer,
output is formatted to the given width in columns.
Otherwise,
.Nm
defaults to the terminal width, or 80 columns if the output is not a terminal.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr disklabel 8 ,
.Xr dumpfs 8 ,
.Xr fdisk 8 ,
.Xr fsck 8 ,
.Xr newfs 8 ,
.Xr tunefs 8

The
.Nm
utility first appeared in
.Fx 4.4 .

after enlarging.

@Switch (non-curses, non-ksh) programs that use COLUMNS to a single idiom.

Previously behaviors were all over the map. This changes them to
use COLUMNS first, and either terminal width or a hardcoded value
(typically 80) as appropriate.

log
@Make growfs refuse to run on a dirty filesystem, and set the filesystem to
dirty on the way out so that users are forced to run fsck afterwards. The
manpage politely suggested that the filesystem be checked after growing it;
change it to say that fsck is required.
