.Bk -words

.Ek
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is designed to change the dynamic parameters of a file system
which affect the layout policies.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl A
Cause the values to be updated in all the alternate
superblocks instead of just the standard superblock.
If this option is not used,
then use of a backup superblock by
.Xr fsck 8
will lose anything changed by
.Nm .
.Fl A
is ignored when
.Fl N
is specified.
.It Fl e Ar maxbpg
This indicates the maximum number of blocks any single file can
allocate out of a cylinder group before it is forced to begin
allocating blocks from another cylinder group.
Typically this value is set to about one quarter of the total blocks
in a cylinder group.
The intent is to prevent any single file from using up all the
blocks in a single cylinder group,
thus degrading access times for all files subsequently allocated
in that cylinder group.
The effect of this limit is to cause big files to do long seeks
more frequently than if they were allowed to allocate all the blocks
in a cylinder group before seeking elsewhere.
For file systems with exclusively large files,
this parameter should be set higher.
.It Fl F
Indicates that
.Ar special
is a file system image, rather than a device name or file system mount point.
.Ar special
will be accessed
.Sq as-is .
.It Fl g Ar avgfilesize
This specifies the expected average file size.
.It Fl h Ar avgfpdir
This specifies the expected number of files per directory.
.It Fl m Ar minfree
This value specifies the percentage of space held back
from normal users; the minimum free space threshold.
The default value is set during creation of the filesystem; see
.Xr newfs 8 .
This value can be set to zero, however up to a factor of three
in throughput will be lost over the performance obtained at a 5%
threshold.
Note that if the value is raised above the current usage level,
users will be unable to allocate files until enough files have
been deleted to get under the higher threshold.
.It Fl N
Display all the settable options
(after any changes from the tuning options)
but do not cause any of them to be changed.
.It Fl o Ar optimize_preference
The file system can either try to minimize the time spent
allocating blocks, or it can attempt to minimize the space
fragmentation on the disk.
If the value of
.Ar minfree
(see above) is less than 5%,
then the file system should optimize for space to avoid
running out of full sized blocks.
For values of
.Ar minfree
greater than or equal to 5%,
fragmentation is unlikely to be problematical, and
the file system can be optimized for time.
.Pp
.Ar optimize_preference
can be specified as either
.Li space
or
.Li time .

.Sh HISTORY
The

command appeared in
.Bx 4.2 .
.Sh BUGS
This program should work on mounted and active file systems.
Because the super-block is not kept in the buffer cache,
the changes will only take effect if the program
is run on unmounted file systems.
To change the root file system, the system must be rebooted
after the file system is tuned.
.Pp
.\" Take this out and a Unix Demon will dog your steps from now until
.\" the time_t's wrap around.
You can tune a file system, but you can't tune a fish.

The parameters which are to be changed are indicated by the flags

d60 22
a81 22
The file system has several backups of the super-block.
Specifying this option will cause all backups to be modified as well as the
primary super-block.
This is potentially dangerous - use with caution.
.It Fl a Ar maxcontig
This specifies the maximum number of contiguous blocks that will
be laid out before forcing a rotational delay (see
.Fl d
below).
The default value depends on the block size
(4 for 16KB blocks, 8 for 8KB blocks and 16 for 4KB blocks).
Most device drivers can chain several buffers together in a single transfer.
For optimal performance, the value of
.Ar maxcontig
should be chosen based on the maximum chain length supported by
the device driver.
.It Fl d Ar rotdelay
This specifies the expected time (in milliseconds)
to service a transfer completion
interrupt and initiate a new transfer on the same disk.
It is used to decide how much rotational spacing to place between
successive blocks in a file.
d97 4
a100 13
.It Fl f Ar avgfilesize
Specifies the expected average file size in bytes.
This value could be used for various optimizations, but for now it is only
used together with
.Ar avgfpdir
to optimize the directory allocation policy.
To take effect, both
.Ar avgfpdir
and
.Ar avgfilesize
must be greater than zero.
(Also see
.Ar avgfpdir . )
d104 3
a106 2
The default value used is 5%.
This value can be set to zero; however, a factor of up to three
a111 15
.It Fl n Ar avgfpdir
Specifies the expected average number of files per directory in
the file system.
This value is used only if both
.Ar avgfilesize
and
.Ar avgfpdir
are greater than zero.
It is used to limit number of directories which may be allocated one after
another in the same cylinder group without intervention by regular files.
This value does not affect most file system operations but is useful for
applications which at first create a directory structure and then populate
with files later.
(Also see
.Ar avgfilesize . )

This option enables soft updates on the file system.
Soft updates
eliminates most synchronous writes to disk by maintaining
a partial order of writes to the disk.
This significantly improves
meta-data operations (file creation and deletion) at the expense of
subjecting them to the same potential 30-second delay as file data.
Recovery is made simpler, however, by maintaining a strict ordering of
writes to disk.
