@partial move to KNF.  More to come.  This has happened because there
are a raft of source code auditors who are willing to help improve this
code only if this is done, and hey, isakmpd does need our standard
auditing process.  ok ho hshoexer

@ISAKMP configuration, a.k.a IKECFG or "mode-config", protocol implementation.
Disabled, has no configuration mechanism yet.  This will be used for roaming
users, who are going to get parameters like IP-address and nameserver from its
peer, very much like DHCP, but securily inside an ISAKMP connection and still
in time before negotiation of IPsec connections.  You may see stylistic fixes
in this commit too.  Add some not yet used Makefile magic to deal with DNSSEC-
enabled OpenSSL too.  The IKECFG code work was sponsered by Gatespace Inc.
Thank you!  Configuration will come very soon, btw.
