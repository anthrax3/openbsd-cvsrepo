@Extensions to the FIFO interface:
"C get [section]:tag" fetches a configuration value.
"C add [section]:tag=value" adds 'value' to a list, typically for the
[Phase 2]:Connections tag. FIFO "S" command destination file changed.
Various KNF cleanups. hshoexer@@ ok.

@partial move to KNF.  More to come.  This has happened because there
are a raft of source code auditors who are willing to help improve this
code only if this is done, and hey, isakmpd does need our standard
auditing process.  ok ho hshoexer

1.1.1.1
log
@Initial import of isakmpd, an IKE (ISAKMP/Oakley) implementation for the
OpenBSD IPSEC stack by me, Niklas Hallqvist and Niels Provos, funded by
Ericsson Radio Systems.  It is not yet complete or usable in a real scenario
but the missing pieces will soon be there.  The early commit is for people
who wants early access and who are not afraid of looking at source.
isakmpd interops with Cisco, Timestep, SSH & Pluto (Linux FreeS/WAN) so
far, so it is not that incomplete.  It is really mostly configuration that
is lacking.
