.Sh NAME
.Nm certpatch
.Nd add subjectAltName identities to X.509 certificates
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm certpatch
.Op Fl t Ar identity-type
.Fl i
.Ar identity
.Fl k
.Ar signing-key
.Ar input-certificate output-certificate
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
alters PEM-encoded X.509 certificates by adding a subjectAltName extension
containing an identity used by the signature-based authentication schemes
of the ISAKMP protocol.
After the addition, the certificate will be signed
once again with the supplied CA signing key.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl i Ar identity
The
.Fl i
option takes an argument which is the identity to put into the
subjectAltName field of the certificate.
If the identity-type is
.Li ip ,
this argument should be an IPv4 address in dotted decimal notation.
.It Fl k Ar signing-key
The
.Fl k
option specifies the key used for signing the certificate once the
subjectAltName extension has been added.
The key is specified by
the filename where it is stored in PEM format.
.It Fl t Ar identity-type
If given, the
.Fl t
option specifies the type of the given identity.
Currently
.Li ip ,
.Li fqdn ,
and
.Li ufqdn
are recognized.
The default is
.Li ip .
