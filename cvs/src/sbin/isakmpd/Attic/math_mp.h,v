log
@Replace the hand-crafted Diffie-Hellman implementation in isakmpd with
the smaller implementation from iked that is using libcrypto instead.
This allows to remove a lot of code (which is always good), get rid of
some custom crypto code by using libcrypto, theoretically adds
support for many new MODP and EC2N/ECP modes (but it is not configurable
yet), and allows to share the dh.c/dh.h code in different codebases
(it is identical in isakmpd and iked, but could also be used elsewhere).

@partial move to KNF.  More to come.  This has happened because there
are a raft of source code auditors who are willing to help improve this
code only if this is done, and hey, isakmpd does need our standard
auditing process.  ok ho hshoexer
