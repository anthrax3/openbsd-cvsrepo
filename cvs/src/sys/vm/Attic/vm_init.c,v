1.3
log
@Merge of MACHINE_NEW_CONTIG (aka MNN) code from Chuck Cranor,
<chuck@@openbsd.org>. This code is as of yet disabled on all platforms,
actually not yet supported on more than mvme68k, although other
platforms are expected soon, as code is already available.
This code makes handling of multiple physical memory regions
consistent over all platforms, as well as keeping the performance of
maintaining a single continuous memory chunk.  It is also a
requirement for the upcoming UVM replacement VM system.

What I did in this merge: just declared the pmap_map function in a
MD include file per port that needs it.  It's not an exported pmap
interface, says Chuck.  It ended up in differnt include files on
differnet ports, as I tried to follow the current policy on a per-arch
basis.

log
@Merge in -current from two days ago in the SMP branch.
As usual with merges, they do not indicate progress, so do not hold
your breath for working SMP, and do not mail me and ask about the
state of it.  It has not changed.  There is work ongoing, but very, very
slowly.  The commit is done in parts as to not lock up the tree in too
big chunks at a time.
