log
@Add basic DWARF line table decoder

Includes a stand-alone addr2line clone for userspace testing.

Tested extensively on amd64 and expected to eventually support other
architectures too.  Importing now so further development/testing can
happen in-tree.  Followup commits will add to the kernel build and
integrate into ddb.

positive feedback; no objections
