@Bye.

@The file `README.ext2fs' is from the Lites; `COPYRIGHT.INFO' is from
FreeBSD.

OpenBSD's version of the ext2fs is based on Lites and FreeBSD, but doesn't
preserve support for those operating systems; doing so would've imposed
far too much of an #ifdef farm upon the code.

Right now, I wouldn't try using this.  It's still being worked on, and
several things are potentially very broken.

@ufs changes: add the notion of directory operators.

gnu/ext2fs: add the second extended filesystem.

Note that I'm commiting this now for the sake of the ufs changes; ext2fs
is not yet fully integrated into the system.
