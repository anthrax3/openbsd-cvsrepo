log
@Extend the libsa loadfile(9) granularity to tell apart randomness from the rest
of the kernel, and extend the array filled by loadfile to report the location
of the randomness area.

This doesn't introduce any change for bootblocks (save for a slightly larger
stack usage due to the larger array), for the new {LOAD,COUNT}_RANDOM bits
are included in the {LOAD,COUNT}_ALL masks everything uses or computes from.

@First pass at removing clauses 3 and 4 from NetBSD licenses.

Not sure what's more surprising: how long it took for NetBSD to
catch up to the rest of the BSDs (including UCB), or the amount of
code that NetBSD has claimed for itself without attributing to the
actual authors.

@Add MI loadfile support, from NetBSD
This is currently only used on powerpc, but may be looked
at for other architectures.
Piece of the support to have kernel symbols on powerpc.
