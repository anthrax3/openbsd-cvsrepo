@First pass at removing clauses 3 and 4 from NetBSD licenses.

Not sure what's more surprising: how long it took for NetBSD to
catch up to the rest of the BSDs (including UCB), or the amount of
code that NetBSD has claimed for itself without attributing to the
actual authors.

OK deraadt@@

@Unifdef NO_IEEE in the libkern softfloat code, and put an appropriate rule
in files.alpha to compensate for NO_IEEE kernels.

This will allow the softfloat code to be used by other platforms than alpha.

log
@IEEE 754 floating point completion code, and implementation of the
FP_C (Floating Point Control Quadword).

From ross@@NetBSD.  Added a way to disable it with option NO_IEEE,
which appears on the ramdisks to save space.  This affects only
programs compiled with -mieee, and what it essentially does is
enabling infinities and NaNs, instead of generating SIGFPE on
division by zero, overflow, etc.
