@<machine/macros.h> would provide inline version of a few of the functions
traditionnaly found in libkern. However, the memcmp() flavour would behave
as bcmp() with only two possible return values: zero and positive non-zero.

This broke the name cache RB trees which now rely upon proper memcmp()
semantics(negative value, zero, or positive value).

Just give up on these macros and provide the same code as libc, in libkern.
As a side effect, this no longer uses the cmpc3 instruction, which is not
implemented and requires (slow) kernel emulation, on the original uVax.

@libkern, begone.  Move to a new mechanism where config(8)'s "file"
directive can select between MI and MD versions of these files.  At
the same time, adjust the boot programs to pick exactly what they need,
instead of the 7 or 8 mechanisms previously used.

There will be some fallout from this, but testing it all by myself is a
ridiculously slow process; it will be finished in-tree.

Various developers were very nice and avoided making fun of me when I
was gibbering in the corner..
