@libkern, begone.  Move to a new mechanism where config(8)'s "file"
directive can select between MI and MD versions of these files.  At
the same time, adjust the boot programs to pick exactly what they need,
instead of the 7 or 8 mechanisms previously used.

There will be some fallout from this, but testing it all by myself is a
ridiculously slow process; it will be finished in-tree.

Various developers were very nice and avoided making fun of me when I
was gibbering in the corner..

@remove strcpy and strcat from the kernel; they are dead and unused code.

(OpenBSD does not use strcat/strcpy in the kernel, if people do it in
external modules they should update their code)

@an amd64 arch support.
hacked by art@@ from netbsd sources and then later debugged
by me into the shape where it can host itself.
no bootloader yet as needs redoing from the
recent advanced i386 sources (anyone? ;)
