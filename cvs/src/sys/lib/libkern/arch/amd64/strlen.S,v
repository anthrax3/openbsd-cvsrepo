/*
 * There are many well known branch-free sequences which are used
 * for determining whether a zero-byte is contained within a word.
 * These sequences are generally much more efficent than loading
 * and comparing each byte individually.
 *
 * The expression [1,2]:
 *
 * (1)  ~(((x & 0x7f....7f) + 0x7f....7f) | (x | 0x7f....7f))
 *
 * evaluates to a non-zero value if any of the bytes in the
 * original word is zero.
 *
 * It also has the useful property that bytes in the result word
 * that correspond to non-zero bytes in the original word have
 * the value 0x00, while bytes corresponding to zero bytes have
 * the value 0x80. This allows calculation of the first (and
 * last) occurrence of a zero byte within the word (useful for C's
 * str* primitives) by counting the number of leading (or
 * trailing) zeros and dividing the result by 8.  On machines
 * without (or with slow) clz() / ctz() instructions, testing
 * each byte in the result word for zero is necessary.
 *
 * This typically takes 4 instructions (5 on machines without
 * "not-or") not including those needed to load the constant.
 *
 *
 * The expression:
 *
 * (2)  ((x - 0x01....01) & 0x80....80 & ~x)
 *
 * evaluates to a non-zero value if any of the bytes in the
 * original word is zero.
 *
 * On little endian machines, the first byte in the result word
 * that corresponds to a zero byte in the original byte is 0x80,
 * so clz() can be used as above.  On big endian machines, and
 * little endian machines without (or with a slow) clz() insn,
 * testing each byte in the original for zero is necessary.
 *
 * This typically takes 3 instructions (4 on machines without
 * "and with complement") not including those needed to load
 * constants.
 *
 *
 * The expression:
 *
 * (3)  ((x - 0x01....01) & 0x80....80)
 *
 * always evaluates to a non-zero value if any of the bytes in
 * the original word is zero or has the top bit set.
 * For strings that are likely to only contain 7-bit ascii these
 * false positives will be rare.
 *
 * To account for possible false positives, each byte of the
 * original word must be checked when the expression evaluates to
 * a non-zero value.  However, because it is simpler than those
 * presented above, code that uses it will be faster as long as
 * the rate of false positives is low.
 *
 * This is likely, because the false positive can only occur
 * if the most siginificant bit of a byte within the word is set.
 * The expression will never fail for typical 7-bit ASCII strings.
 *
 * This typically takes 2 instructions not including those needed
 * to load constants.

@Like libc, also for the kernel: Import new amd64 assembly versions of
strchr/index, strrchr/rindex, and strlen that provide a significantly
faster performance than our previous .c or .S implementations.  Based
on NetBSD's code.

Tested with different amd64 CPUs.

@Remove assembly version of strlen from i386 and amd64, where it's
up to 3 times slower than the C code most of the time.  This was
brought up by DragonflyBSD guys initially.

ok deraadt, guenther. miod will not miss it.
