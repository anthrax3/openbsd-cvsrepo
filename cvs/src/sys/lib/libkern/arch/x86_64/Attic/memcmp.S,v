@change amd64's MACHINE_ARCH from x86_64 to amd64.  There are many many
reasons for this, quite a few of them technical, and not all of them
in response to Intel's broken ia32e crud.  The gcc toolchain stays at
x86_64 for now.

@an amd64 arch support.
hacked by art@@ from netbsd sources and then later debugged
by me into the shape where it can host itself.
no bootloader yet as needs redoing from the
recent advanced i386 sources (anyone? ;)
