@"It's not the years, honey; it's the mileage."

bluetooth support doesn't work and isn't going anywhere. the current
design is a dead end, and should not be the basis for any future support.
general consensus says to whack it so as to not mislead the unwary.

@First step in Bluetooth protocol stack support.

The code is adopted from the FreeBSD netgraph-based Bluetooth
implementation by Maksim Yevmenkin <m_evmenkin@@yahoo.com> but
all netgraph glue was replaced with usual BSD network stack
hooks. This is a work in progress. Only HCI layer works for now,
L2CAP and RFCOMM are on the way.

Help in testing from many, ok markus@@.
