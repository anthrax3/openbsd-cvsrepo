1.2
log
@UBC was a disaster. It worked very good when it worked, but on some
machines or some configurations or in some phase of the moon (we actually
don't know when or why) files disappeared. Since we've not been able to
track down the problem in two weeks intense debugging and we need -current
to be stable, back out everything to a state it had before UBC.

We apologise for the inconvenience.

1.1
log
@Big cleanup inspired by NetBSD with some parts of the code from NetBSD.
 - get rid of VOP_BALLOCN and VOP_SIZE
 - move the generic getpages and putpages into miscfs/genfs
 - create a genfs_node which must be added to the top of the private portion
   of each vnode for filsystems that want to use genfs_{get,put}pages
 - rename genfs_mmap to vop_generic_mmap

1.1.2.2
log
@Huge sync to NetBSD plus lots of bugfixes.
 - uvm is as in netbsd-current minus uvm_map forward merge.
 - various locking bugfixes in nfs.
 - make sure that all specops and fifoops are correct in all vnodeop vectors.
 - make the filesystem code more like filsystem code and less like vm code.
