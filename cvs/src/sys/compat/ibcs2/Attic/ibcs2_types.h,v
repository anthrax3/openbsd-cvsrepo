@now that all partition size/offsets are potentially 64-bit, change the
type of all variables to daddr64_t.  this includes the APIs for XXsize()
and XXdump(), all range checks inside bio drivers, internal variables
for disklabel handling, and even uvm's swap offsets.  re-read numerous
times by otto, miod, krw, thib to look for errors
