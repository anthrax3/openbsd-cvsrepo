@Add set_tid_address() syscall. Lots of help from and okay guenther@@.

This is more than a simple syscall.This expands TLS support quite a bit.
Also linux_sys_clone() handles CLONE_CHILD_CLEARTID, CLONE_CHILD_SETTID,
CLONE_PARENT_SETTID flags as well as the CLONE_SETTLS by doing what
set_thread_area() is doing.

Next on the list is futex support which should allow compat to cope with
newer Linux kernels.

@First pass at removing clauses 3 and 4 from NetBSD licenses.

Not sure what's more surprising: how long it took for NetBSD to
catch up to the rest of the BSDs (including UCB), or the amount of
code that NetBSD has claimed for itself without attributing to the
actual authors.

@add exec/fork/exit hooks per process for compat emulations.
use them to correctly emulate linux brk.
update to TNF copyright in linux_exec.c.

from netbsd, mostly from a diff by Kurt Miller in pr3318.
this should fix java.  no regressions in testing by kurt and sturm@@.
be prepared for "proc size mismatch" -- recompile ps and friends.
