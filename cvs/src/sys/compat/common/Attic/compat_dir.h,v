@Switch time_t, ino_t, clock_t, and struct kevent's ident and data
members to 64bit types.  Assign new syscall numbers for (almost
all) the syscalls that involve the affected types, including anything
with time_t, timeval, itimerval, timespec, rusage, dirent, stat,
or kevent arguments.  Add a d_off member to struct dirent and replace
getdirentries() with getdents(), thus immensely simplifying and
accelerating telldir/seekdir.  Build perl with -DBIG_TIME.

Bump the major on every single base library: the compat bits included
here are only good enough to make the transition; the T32 compat
option will be burned as soon as we've reached the new world are
are happy with the snapshots for all architectures.

DANGER: ABI incompatibility.  Updating to this kernel requires extra
work or you won't be able to login: install a snapshot instead.

Much assistance in fixing userland issues from deraadt@@ and tedu@@
and build assistance from todd@@ and otto@@

1.1
log
@

SunOS, IBCS2, Linux, and SVR4 all require translations of directory entries
from OpenBSD format to their respective native formats.

A lot of common code here for interfacing with OpenBSD VOP_READDIR. Most
of this code and logic has been moved to common/compat_dir.c

When reading a portion of the directory, the compatibility layer registers
a callback which is passed an OpenBSD-style dirent and the cookie/offset.
