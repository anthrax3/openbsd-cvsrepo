/*
 * Cache tags can be written in control space, and must be set to 0
 * (or invalid anyway) before turning on the cache.  The tags are
 * addressed as an array of 32-bit structures of the form:
 *
 *	struct cache_tag {
 *		u_int	:7,		(unused; must be zero)
 *			ct_cid:3,	(context ID)
 *			ct_w:1,		(write flag from PTE)
 *			ct_s:1,		(supervisor flag from PTE)
 *			ct_v:1,		(set => cache entry is valid)
 *			:3,		(unused; must be zero)
 *			ct_tid:14,	(cache tag ID)
 *			:2;		(unused; must be zero)
 *	};
 *
 * The SPARCstation 1 cache sees virtual addresses as:
 *
 *	struct cache_va {
 *		u_int	:2,		(unused; probably copies of va_tid<13>)
 *			cva_tid:14,	(tag ID)
 *			cva_line:12,	(cache line number)
 *			cva_byte:4;	(byte in cache line)
 *	};
 *
 * (The SS2 cache is similar but has half as many lines, each twice as long.)
 *
 * Note that, because the 12-bit line ID is `wider' than the page offset,
 * it is possible to have one page map to two different cache lines.
 * This can happen whenever two different physical pages have the same bits
 * in the part of the virtual address that overlaps the cache line ID, i.e.,
 * bits <15:12>.  In order to prevent cache duplication, we have to
 * make sure that no one page has more than one virtual address where
 * (va1 & 0xf000) != (va2 & 0xf000).  (The cache hardware turns off ct_v
 * when a cache miss occurs on a write, i.e., if va1 is in the cache and
 * va2 is not, and you write to va2, va1 goes out of the cache.  If va1
 * is in the cache and va2 is not, reading va2 also causes va1 to become
 * uncached, and the [same] data is then read from main memory into the
 * cache.)
 *
 * The other alternative, of course, is to disable caching of aliased
 * pages.  (In a few cases this might be faster anyway, but we do it
 * only when forced.)
 *
 * The Sun4, since it has an 8K pagesize instead of 4K, needs to check
 * bits that are one position higher.
 */

/* 
 * The spitfire has a 16K two-way set associative level-1 I$ and a separate 
 * 16K level-1 D$.  The I$ can be invalidated using the FLUSH instructions, 
 * so we don't really need to worry about it much.  The D$ is 16K write-through
 * direct mapped virtually addressed cache with two 16-byte sub-blocks per line.  
 * The E$ is a 512KB-4MB direct mapped physically indexed physically tagged cache.
 * Since the level-1 caches are write-through, they don't need flushing and can be
 * invalidated directly.  
 *
 * The spitfire sees virtual addresses as:
 *
 *	struct cache_va {
 *		u_int64_t	:22,		(unused; we only have 40-bit addresses)
 *				cva_tag:28,	(tag ID)
 *				cva_line:9,	(cache line number)
 *				cva_byte:5;	(byte within line)
 *	};
 *
 * Since there is one bit of overlap between the page offset and the line index,
 * all we need to do is make sure that bit 14 of the va remains constant and we have
 * no aliasing problems.  
 *
 * Let me try again.  Page size is 8K, cache size is 16K so if (va1&0x3fff != va2&0x3fff)
 * we have a problem.  Bit 14 *must* be the same for all mappings of a page to be cacheable
 * in the D$.  (The I$ is 16K 2-way associative--each bank is 8K.  No conflict there.)
