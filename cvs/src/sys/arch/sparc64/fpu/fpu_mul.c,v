/*
 * The multiplication algorithm for normal numbers is as follows:
 *
 * The fraction of the product is built in the usual stepwise fashion.
 * Each step consists of shifting the accumulator right one bit
 * (maintaining any guard bits) and, if the next bit in y is set,
 * adding the multiplicand (x) to the accumulator.  Then, in any case,
 * we advance one bit leftward in y.  Algorithmically:
 *
 *	A = 0;
 *	for (bit = 0; bit < FP_NMANT; bit++) {
 *		sticky |= A & 1, A >>= 1;
 *		if (Y & (1 << bit))
 *			A += X;
 *	}
 *
 * (X and Y here represent the mantissas of x and y respectively.)
 * The resultant accumulator (A) is the product's mantissa.  It may
 * be as large as 11.11111... in binary and hence may need to be
 * shifted right, but at most one bit.
 *
 * Since we do not have efficient multiword arithmetic, we code the
 * accumulator as four separate words, just like any other mantissa.
 * We use local `register' variables in the hope that this is faster
 * than memory.  We keep x->fp_mant in locals for the same reason.
 *
 * In the algorithm above, the bits in y are inspected one at a time.
 * We will pick them up 32 at a time and then deal with those 32, one
 * at a time.  Note, however, that we know several things about y:
 *
 *    - the guard and round bits at the bottom are sure to be zero;
 *
 *    - often many low bits are zero (y is often from a single or double
 *	precision source);
 *
 *    - bit FP_NMANT-1 is set, and FP_1*2 fits in a word.
 *
 * We can also test for 32-zero-bits swiftly.  In this case, the center
 * part of the loop---setting sticky, shifting A, and not adding---will
 * run 32 times without adding X to A.  We can do a 32-bit shift faster
 * by simply moving words.  Since zeros are common, we optimize this case.
 * Furthermore, since A is initially zero, we can omit the shift as well
 * until we reach a nonzero word.
