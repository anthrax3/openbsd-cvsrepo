@First pass at removing clauses 3 and 4 from NetBSD licenses.

Not sure what's more surprising: how long it took for NetBSD to
catch up to the rest of the BSDs (including UCB), or the amount of
code that NetBSD has claimed for itself without attributing to the
actual authors.

@(128 << fd->sc_type->secsize) instead of (128 * (1 << fd->sc_type->secsize)).

Makes all FD_BSIZE() defines the same. No object code change.

@Preliminary support for the floppy drive on Ultrasparcs. Only tested on
SBus machines so far, although EBus attachment glue is provided but not enabled
by default.

Also, fdformat(8) does not work correctly yet, although reading and writing
is safe; this will hopefully be fixed in the near future.
