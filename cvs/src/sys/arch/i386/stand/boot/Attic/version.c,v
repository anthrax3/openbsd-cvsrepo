1.3
log
@commit all my mods to the last imported libsa stuff....
including:
- disklabel support;
- better boot cmd line
- smaller size (using some compilation switches ;)
- no more relocations in /boot, it's loaded in the place;
- better disk performance (maybe were already in there)
- installboot -n does not require write perms for device
- more debugs
- missing parts in libsa (such as cd9660 and so)
- i don't like 2 files for exec_i386 (sorry, toby, let's discuss maybe?)
tricks and tails:
- joined .text and .data (saves you a page)
- prot mode switching still in biosboot (it's freezed for awhile)
- biosdisk internals changed
- biosdev is not passed propery to the kernel (i'll fix it soon)
- sure i missed smth here to note (use the source, Luke!)
