log
@for some time now mandoc has not required MLINKS to function
correctly - logically complete that now by removing MLINKS from base;

util being added. MLINKS will still work, and remain for perl to ease
upgrades;

@Build a 'fdboot' that will be used for floppy disk media. This can be made
smaller than the normal 'boot', however for now it is identical.
