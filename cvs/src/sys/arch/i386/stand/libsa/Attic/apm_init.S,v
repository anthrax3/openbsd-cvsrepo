@mickey has pieces he has not committed.
if he puts the tree in an unbuildable state again..
anyway, all these problems came from the fact that etc/genassym.cf
wasn't even being used, and assym.h is where key defines were supposed
to be coming from. now we actually include etc/genassym.cf in the
genassym.sh processing, and remove the #includes i had in place to
work around it. now if mickey had committed machine/biosvar.h, etc/Makefile,
and these asm files all at the same time, there wouldn't have been
a problem....
