1.1
log
@Pull out the ELF loadfile pieces from the standalone libraries, so that
both 32- and 64-bit versions can be created (previously only one or the
other could be built for a given boot loader).

Use this to allow the i386 and amd64 boot blocks to boot both ELF32 and
ELF64 kernels (i.e. amd64 boot blocks can now load i386 kernels, and
vice versa).  Obviously the system must support LONG mode in order to
successfully run the amd64 kernel once it is loaded.

Advice and discussions from/with dale@@ (going back three years).  Much
testing nick@@ and todd@@; thanks.
