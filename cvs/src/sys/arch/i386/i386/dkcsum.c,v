@remove the #define b_cylinder b_resid from bufs. i hated the
overloading of that thing.

the only hardware that seems to care about cylinders in our tree
are floppy drives, and the drivers for those calculate their own
cylinders from logical block addresses and ignore whatever the rest
of the kernel thought b_cylinders should be.

most of this diff is moving the floppy drivers to using b_resid as
a resid and using that as part of the calculation for real cylinder
values.

the rest of the diff is getting rid of the useless assignments to
b_cylinder that dont get used by anything (now that disksort is
gone).

@Ensure we don't re-issue a failed buf without clearing B_ERROR and
b_error. Otherwise a good i/o will appear to have failed. Fixes
problem with dkcsum.c being unable to read data to checksum from
subsequent devices after an i/o fails. And thus failing to find
correct root in some cases.

Introduced at k2k11 with buf flags rectification. Scan of all
biowait() calls finds no other obvious re-use of a buf that could
have error'ed out. Just re-use of bufs that worked. So quick fix
pending closer review of all uses.

Problem noted by Jens A. Griepen.

@bring src/sys/arch/amd64/amd64/dkcsum.c r1.16 over to i386:

the boot loader passes a variable that identifies the disk its
booting off made up of a bunch of fields like adapter, controller,
disk, and partition offsets, plus a table of all the disks it can
see which includes this id and a checksum.

the kernel goes through and checksums the disks and then maps that
back to the id associated with that disk, and then compares some
of the fields in those ids against the boot disks id to figure out
which disk its on.

the problem is we overflow one of those fields (the disk id one).
since the other fields are set to 0 by the boot loader, this doesnt
really matter that much. however, since those fields are now
significant because of the overflow, we should compare them too.

this prevents sd16 being matched as the boot disk after sd0 on my
system with 25 disks attached.

@Fix buffer cache pending read statistics by ensuring we can identify
biowait() reads that do *not* come from the buffer cache - we use the
B_RAW flag to identify these at art's suggestion - since it makes sense
and the flag was not being used. this just flags all these buffers with
B_RAW - biodone already ignores returned buffers marked B_RAW.

@Cleanup SKEY_NOT_READY logic. Only retry command if it's likely the
condition is going to clear up, which speeds up boot by avoiding
delays in disk matching. Return ENODEV if media is not present, which
avoids trying to spin up disks that are not present. Use ENODEV in
amd64/i386 dkcsum.c to filter failure reports.

Mostly from NetBSD.
