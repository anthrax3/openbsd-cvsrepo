log
@sync w/ netbsd almost -current code (;
fixes quite a few problems.
adds new option PCIBIOS_ADDR_FIXUP.
numerous extra fixes by me, also pointed out by other ppl,
such as avoid panics, ifdef on pciverbose, not diagnostic,
some other smaller knits; some have been forwarded back
to netbsd developers, some will go soon too.
