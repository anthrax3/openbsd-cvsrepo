This readme file is here to show you how new boot is different
from the 386BSD and Mach ones, those readmes are kept as a good
information source, and also to remark the roots.

This new boots are designed to be a real bootstrap for the smart and
friendly /boot program, that is supposed to load /bsd then.
Neither user interaction nor any useful output, just loading the /boot.
This boots maybe used as a MBR program then providing some choice
about what MBR partition to boot from, as good as 2nd stage loader,
that is loaded by some other MBR (assuming later one will provide
partition table entry pointer in ds:si).
