/*
 *	NOTE ANY CHANGES YOU MAKE TO THE BOOTBLOCKS HERE.

 *		move the filesystem insert stuff to the kernel.
 *
 *      1.29 -> 1.30
 *		Prefer a type 166 partition if found. 166 is the OpenBSD
 *		partition type.
 *
 *	1.28 -> 1.29
 *		adding program for booting from DOS file.
 *		implement 'list files' (Luke Mewburn <lukem@@telstra.com.au>)
 *
 *	1.27 -> 1.28
 *		fix gets to use real timeout instead of loop and do
 *		a little cleanup, and add some prototypes. A lot more
 *		needs to be done here. (perry)
 *
 *	1.26 -> 1.27
 *		size reduction and code cleanup. (mycroft)
 *
 *	1.25 -> 1.26
 *		size reduction and code cleanup. (mycroft)
 *
 *	1.24 -> 1.25
 *		add support for serial consoles. (mycroft)
 *

 *		change RCS ID format.  NOW NEED TO UPDATE STRING BELOW
 *		BY HAND.
 *

 *		fix problem with empty symbol tables. (mycroft)
 *
 *	1.21 -> 1.22, 1.21.2.1
 *		fix compatibility with pre-4.4 file systems. (mycroft)
 *
 *	1.20 -> 1.21
 *		update for 4.4-Lite file system includes and macros (cgd)
 *
 *	1.19 -> 1.20
 *		display options in std. format, more changes for size (cgd)
 *
 *	1.18 -> 1.19
 *		add a '-r' option, to specify RB_DFLTROOT (cgd)
 *
 *	1.17 -> 1.18
 *		removed some more code we don't need for BDB. (mycroft)
 *
 *	1.16 -> 1.17
 *		removed with prejudice the extra buffer for xread(), changes
 *		to make the code smaller, and general cleanup. (mycroft)
 *
 *	1.15 -> 1.16
 *		reduce BUFSIZE to 4k, because that's fixed the
 *		boot problems, for some. (cgd)
 *
 *	1.14 -> 1.15
 *		seperated 'version' out from boot.c (cgd)
 *
 *	1.1 -> 1.14
 *		look in boot.c revision logs

log
@from perry:
fix my own pr 1762, in which it was noted that boot2 used a busy loop
to time out the boot prompt.  Now uses a usleep() routine that calls
the BIOS and the functionality is separate from gets(). Timeout is
#defined to 5 seconds. Also did some minor cleanup in preparation to
prototype/ANSIfy everything.
(problem was originally reported by deraadt a number of years ago)
