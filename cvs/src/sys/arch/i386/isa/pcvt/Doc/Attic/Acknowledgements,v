@Thank You,					    (in the order of appearance)


	Lynne and Bill Jolitz

		for your work on 386BSD and making all this possible !


	Holger Veit		(veit@@du9ds3.uni-duisburg.de)

		for the permission to use a modified version of his keyboard
		driver and utilities for keyboard remapping / multinational
		keyboard support.


	Per Lindberg

		for the extremely helpful vt100 terminal testprogram found
		in the directory vttest.


	John Birchfield	

		for the ncsa telnet package, which contains a vt100 emulation
		and which was very helpful in studying some concepts.


	Ralf Friedl		(friedl@@informatik.uni-kl.de)

		for making his implementation of multi-sceens for the net-2
		distribution available.	i looked at this and took some ideas
		and lines from his code.


	Bruce Evans		(bde@@runx.oz.au)

		for contributing some bugfixes and a complete termcap entry


	Brian H. Dunford-Shore  (brian@@morpheus.wustl.edu)

		for contributing most of the EGA/VGA screen switching code
		and being a fast, reliable and responsive co-author. This
		driver would not be what it is without Brian, Thank You !


	Frank da Cruz		(fdc@@columbia.edu)

		for my famous datacomm program and for giving the permission
		to redistribute files from the msdos kermit distribution
		located in the directory support/demo.


	Joerg Wunsch		(joerg_wunsch@@uriah.sax.de)

		for contributing precise bugreports and -fixes, the 8x10
		EGA/VGA fonts and the color palette ioctls and for being
		a very responsive contributor of various ideas.
		Joerg wrote pcvt's interface to XFree86 1.2 and 1.3 and
		the SYSV/syscons - like interface to XFree86 2.0.
		There would be no support for X without Joerg's work!
		    Thank you very much Joerg, i enjoy it !!! :-)


	Scott Turner		(scotty@@gagetalker.com)

		for contributing code to change the winsize structure, many
		discussions on the keyboard code and fine-tuning the driver
		

	Gordon L. Burditt	(gordon@@sneaky.lonestar.org)

		for the nicest and most complete bugreports i ever got


	Theo Deraadt		(deraadt@@fsa.ca)

		for pushing me forward. There would be no 3.00 release
		if Theo didn't asked for features ... ;-)


	Onno van der Linden	(c/o frank@@fwi.uva.nl)

		for writing the 132 column support for the Cirrus
		chipsets although he had no time to do it ... :-)


	Wolfram Solfrank, Ingo Koenig

		for putting some data onto tape (and handling and shipping
		in the case of Wolfgang) to provide me with some latest
		sources because i still have no ip-connectivity ....


	Michael Havemester	(tik@@abqhh.hanse.de)

		for giving me a chance to stay up to date with NetBSD-
		current, for programming the initial version of the fast
		scrolling code and for the keyboard fifo code!


	Charles Hannum		(mycroft@@gnu.ai.mit.edu)

		for getting bored by a slow-scrolling video driver and 
		for leaving me some bugs to fix ;-)


	The NetBSD and FreeBSD teams

		for giving me something to play, work and learn with !
		There would be nothing to write a driver for without you !!!


	J.T. Conklin

		for forwarding the pcvt-related NetBSD PR's to me !
	

	John Kohl

		for producing patches for NetBSD-current !

@Merge in -current from two days ago in the SMP branch.
As usual with merges, they do not indicate progress, so do not hold
your breath for working SMP, and do not mail me and ask about the
state of it.  It has not changed.  There is work ongoing, but very, very
slowly.  The commit is done in parts as to not lock up the tree in too
big chunks at a time.
