II.	Emulating Character Set Selection
=========================================

MDA/HCG/CGA:

	just a partial emulation is done, because these boards don't allow
	downloadable charactersets. some characters simply don't display
	because they are not in the characterset roms on the video board.

	if you want to change the mapping, have a look at the default tables
	in pcvt_tbl.h.

EGA/VGA:

	these cards have provisions for downloadable charactersets and so
	many vt220/vt320 charactersets are fully supported:

		- US Ascii
		- DEC Supplemental
		- DEC Special Graphic
		- DEC Technical
		- ISO Latin-1
		- Downloadable

	when the emulator is started, it behaves initially similar to
	the MDA/CGA/HCG method described above.

	when a second (special) characterset for a given screen resolution
	is loaded via the "loadfont" utility, the emulator detects this fact
	and uses from then on extended tables to access the second charset
	as an upper half 512 characterset in terms of ega/vga speak.

	from this time on, vt220 downloadable fonts are usable.

	the organization of this extended characterset is as follows:

		0x00 ... 0x1f	C0 display function fonts
		0x20 ... 0x3f	C1 display function fonts
		0x40 ... 0x9f	fonts for DEC Supplemental, DEC Special
				Graphic, DEC Technical and ISO Latin-1
		0xa0 ... 0xff	VT220 Downloadable Font
	
	the mapping between vt220 charactersets and the charactersets inside
	the ega/vga is done by tables found in the file pcvt_tbl.h.
	
	there is a MSDOS fonteditor called "EVAFONT" available on the
	SIMTEL-20 archive, which i used to edit the character sets in the
	distribution.

@Merge in -current from two days ago in the SMP branch.
As usual with merges, they do not indicate progress, so do not hold
your breath for working SMP, and do not mail me and ask about the
state of it.  It has not changed.  There is work ongoing, but very, very
slowly.  The commit is done in parts as to not lock up the tree in too
big chunks at a time.
