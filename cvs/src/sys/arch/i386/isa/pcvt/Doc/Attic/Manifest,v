directory	description
---------	---------------------------------------------------------------

cursor		Very simple program to set the cursor shape.

demo		Files demonstrating pcvts capabilities:
		- chardemo.vt and colors.vt: These two files are from the
		  MSDOS-Kermit distribution from the Columbia University.
		  They can be "cat"-ed to the terminal screen and display
		  all supported VT220 charactersets and all possible colors
		  respectively.
		- sgr.vt: A demonstration of the various display enhancement
		  combinations for the DECSGR escape sequence.
		- some other VT animations i collected over the time and a
		  program to play them on pcvt with adjustable delay.

fed		A simple, System V (n)curses based font-editor for the EGA/VGA
		fonts in the below mentioned font - directory.

fontedit	A program to edit VT220 downloadable character sets.

fonts		Contains uuencoded binary fontfiles following the naming rule:

				vt220<X>.<YYY>.uu

		<X> can be 'l' or 'h', where 'l' stands for a standard
			IBM II charset and is to be loaded first for the
			base characterset to support a desired resolution,
			and 'h' is the extended characterset needed for proper
			VT220 emulation and is to be loaded as the second set
			in addition to the above mentioned base characterset.

		<YYY> is the identifier for the character cell size, currently
			we have:
			808 = 8x8  - 50 lines on VGA, 43 lines on EGA
			810 = 8x10 - 40 lines on VGA
			814 = 8x14 - 28 lines on VGA, 25 lines on EGA
			816 = 8x16 - 25 lines on VGA

		Files distributed:

			vt220l.808.uu, vt220h.808.uu
			vt220l.810.uu, vt220h.810.uu
			vt220l.814.uu, vt220h.814.uu
			vt220l.816.uu, vt220h.816.uu

ispcvt		A short program usable in shell scripts to verify that the
		current running kernel has pcvt compiled in and that the
		the utility version and the driver version are the same,
		also used to display all compile-time options.

kbdio		Keyboard controller debugging utility

kcon		Program to control various aspects of the keyboard such as
		key remapping for national keyboards etc.

keycap		A library for accessing the keycap database

loadfont	Program to download charactersets into EGA/VGA character
		generator memory.

mcon		A program to control the mouse emulation via the keyboard

pcvtdoc		Makefile and manual page for the driver and ioctl's

scon		Program to control various aspects of terminal emulation,
		such as: emulation mode, screen switching etc.

set2061		A program to set the programmable clock generator on my S3-
		based ELSA Winner 1000 VGA board.
		---------------------- CAUTION ------------------------------
		Because you are able to change the timings without check
		or warning, this program may permanently damage your monitor.
		If you don't know what you are doing, DO NOT USE IT !!!!!!!!!
		-------------------------------------------------------------

userkeys	A program to edit the VT220 programmable function keys.

vgaio		A program to read and write VGA registers.
		---------------------- CAUTION ------------------------------
		Because you are able to change the timings without check
		or warning, this program may permanently damage your monitor.
		If you don't know what you are doing, DO NOT USE IT !!!!!!!!!
		-------------------------------------------------------------


vttest		A VT100 compatibility tester. This is a test tool for
		VT100 emulation writers and terminal buyers.

@Merge in -current from two days ago in the SMP branch.
As usual with merges, they do not indicate progress, so do not hold
your breath for working SMP, and do not mail me and ask about the
state of it.  It has not changed.  There is work ongoing, but very, very
slowly.  The commit is done in parts as to not lock up the tree in too
big chunks at a time.
