1.2
log
@- Add console/X mouse transparency, so you don't have to kill moused to run X.
- Introduce `select units' (by char/word/line). Behaves more like an xterm now.
- Serial mice should now work after this commit.
- Many bug fixes.

Work by Jean-Baptiste.Marchand@@epita.fr, except for the X cohabitation code
which was written by Julien.Montagne@@epita.fr.

1.2.4.1
log
@Update the SMP branch to -current, this breaks the SMP branch though.
But it will be fixed soonish.  Note, nothing new has happened, this is just
a merge of the trunk into this branch.

1.2.4.2
log
@Merge in -current from two days ago in the SMP branch.
As usual with merges, they do not indicate progress, so do not hold
your breath for working SMP, and do not mail me and ask about the
state of it.  It has not changed.  There is work ongoing, but very, very
slowly.  The commit is done in parts as to not lock up the tree in too
big chunks at a time.

1.1
log
@Kernel support for new PCVT console mouse features.

- Basic cut/paste functionality.
- Wheel mouse support (wheel rolls page-by-page through scrollback buffer).
- Copybuffer ownership. i.e., if User X logs in the console and selects text,
  when User Y logs in later the buffer cannot be pasted.

Big thanks to Jean-Baptiste Marchand, Julien Montagne, and Jerome Verdon for
implementing this.
