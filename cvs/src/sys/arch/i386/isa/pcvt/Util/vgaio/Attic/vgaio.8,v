.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm vgaio
.Nd perform input/output on a Video Graphics Array
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm vgaio
.Op Fl d
.Op Fl f Ar devname
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Ss Purpose
.Nm Vgaio
is used to perform register-level input/output on a Video Graphics Array.
Since some of the sequences required to access those registers are very
silly,
.Nm vgaio
cares of all the things necessary and allows the user to access the
registers of several register groups with their symbolic names.

.Ss Options
.Bl -tag -width 10n -offset indent -compact
.It Fl d
Turn on the grammar parser debugger.

.It Fl f Ar devname
Operate on device
.Ar devname
instead of the default
.Pa /dev/console .

.El
.Ss Command language
The command language of
.Nm
constitutes of some very simple tokens and rules. Commands are executed
line by line as they are entered. Each line may contain any number of
semicolon-separated input/output commands.

Symbolic register names look like:

.D1 Ao Em reggroup Ac Ao Em regnumber Ac

with
.Aq Em regnumber
being any hexadecimal number
.Pq without a leading Em 0x ,
and
.Aq Em reggroup
one of the strings
.Dq Em ar ,
.Dq Em cr ,
.Dq Em gr ,
.Dq Em mi ,
or
.Dq Em sr ,
standing for the
.Em Attribute controller ,
.Em CRT controller ,
.Em Graphics controller ,
.Em Miscellaneous Output Register ,
or
.Em Timing sequencer ,
respectively.

An input instruction has the form

.D1 Ao Em regname Ac ?

and will cause
.Nm
to output a line like

.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Ao Em regname Ac \& = 0x Ns
.Aq Em number
.Ed

An output instruction looks like

.Bd -ragged -offset indent
.Ao Em regname Ac =
.Aq Em number
.Ed

Spaces or Tabs between the
.Aq Em reggroup ,
the
.Aq Em regnumber ,
or any of the other tokens are ignored. They are not required anyway.

The
.Dq Em mi
register does not require an argument
.Aq Em regnumber ;
it's actually being ignored.


.Ss Access control
The caller must have uid 0 in order to gain the required access to
the IO registers.

.Sh FILES
.Pa /dev/console
is used as the default device to enable access to the IO registers.

.Sh HISTORY
This program is considered
.Dq hackware .
It has been developed in order to simplify the process of developing other
software that needs to program the Video Graphics Array.

Remember, to use this program, your kernel has to be compiled with XSERVER
being defined.

.Sh AUTHOR
The program has been contributed by
.if n Joerg Wunsch,
.if t J\(:org Wunsch,
Dresden
.Aq joerg_wunsch@@uriah.heep.sax.de .

@- remove all trailing whitespace
     * except when it is escaped with a `\' at the end of the line
- fix remaining .Nm usage as well
- this is from a patch I received from kwesterback@@home.com, who has been
  working on some scripts for fixing formatting errors in mdoc'd man pages

Ok, so there could be a cost/benefit debate with this commit, but since I have
the patch we might as well commit it...

log
@Merge in -current from two days ago in the SMP branch.
As usual with merges, they do not indicate progress, so do not hold
your breath for working SMP, and do not mail me and ask about the
state of it.  It has not changed.  There is work ongoing, but very, very
slowly.  The commit is done in parts as to not lock up the tree in too
big chunks at a time.

@The proper order of the ``introductory'' macros in a man page is .Dd/.Dt/.Os.
Out of the approximately 1450 man pages, only about 90 of them were wrong.
Thanks to kwesterback@@home.com for coming up with a script and patch to repair
this. The patch also inserted a .Os macro in the few man pages that were
missing one.
