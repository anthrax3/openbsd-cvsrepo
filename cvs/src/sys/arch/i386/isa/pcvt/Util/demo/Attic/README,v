@- The files "chardemo.vt" and "colors.vt" are taken from the MSDOS Kermit 
  distribution and are redistributed with permission from Frank da Cruz.

- cat chardemo.vt - displays all available character sets

- cat colors.vt   - displays all available back/foreground color combinations

- cat sgr.vt      - displays all possible graphic renditions

- all other files are some VT100 animations collected over the time from
  unkown sources, play them with playvt.

- Playvt is a program to play an animation file on pcvt: because pcvt is
  _much_ faster than an original VT100/VT220, it adds a programmable delay
  for each character so one can enjoy smooth-running animations! :-)
  There is no manpage available for playvt, just try to run playvt -? which
  should give sufficient information. You have to empirically find out which
  delay value fit's your needs!

have fun!

@Merge in -current from two days ago in the SMP branch.
As usual with merges, they do not indicate progress, so do not hold
your breath for working SMP, and do not mail me and ask about the
state of it.  It has not changed.  There is work ongoing, but very, very
slowly.  The commit is done in parts as to not lock up the tree in too
big chunks at a time.
