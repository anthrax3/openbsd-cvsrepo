.Sh NAME
.Nm ispcvt
.Nd verify if current video driver is pcvt driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm ispcvt
.Op Fl c
.Op Fl d Ar device
.Op Fl v
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility allows the user to check whether the current video driver compiled
into the kernel is a pcvt driver. The major and minor release numbers of
the driver are also checked.
Furthermore
.Nm
is also able to print out the values of all the
.Dq Ar PCVT_XXXXXX
compile time options, the driver in the current running kernel was
compiled with.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl d
Specifies a device for which the check is done.
.It Fl v
Specifies being verbose. On success the name and revision is reported, on
failure which comparison failed.
.It Fl c
This options prints out the values of all
.Dq Ar PCVT_XXXXXX
#defines which were given to the compiler at the time the currently running
kernel was compiled. Specifying
.Fl v
with the
.Fl c
option gives a verbose listing of the compile-time options.
.Sh RETURN VALUE
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.Pp
.It Sy 0
driver is pcvt and major and minor numbers match
.It Sy 1
open or ioctl system call failed
.It Sy 2
driver name mismatch
.It Sy 3
name matched, release major number mismatch
.It Sy 4
name & major number matched, release minor number mismatch
.It Sy 5
usage error
.El
.Sh BUGS
No known bugs

@Merge in -current from two days ago in the SMP branch.
As usual with merges, they do not indicate progress, so do not hold
your breath for working SMP, and do not mail me and ask about the
state of it.  It has not changed.  There is work ongoing, but very, very
slowly.  The commit is done in parts as to not lock up the tree in too
big chunks at a time.

@The proper order of the ``introductory'' macros in a man page is .Dd/.Dt/.Os.
Out of the approximately 1450 man pages, only about 90 of them were wrong.
Thanks to kwesterback@@home.com for coming up with a script and patch to repair
this. The patch also inserted a .Os macro in the few man pages that were
missing one.
