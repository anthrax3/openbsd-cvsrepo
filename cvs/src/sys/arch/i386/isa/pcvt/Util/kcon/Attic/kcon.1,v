.Sh NAME
.Nm kcon
.Nd keyboard control and remapping for the pcvt driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm kcon
.Op Fl d Ar delay
.Op Fl l
.Op Fl m Ar map
.Op Fl o
.Op Fl p
.Op Fl R
.Op Fl r Ar rate
.Op Fl s
.Op Fl t Ns Ar +/-
.Op Fl x
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm kcon
is used for controlling all aspects of keyboard configuration for the 'pcvt'
video driver.
.Pp
The available options are:
.Bl -tag -width flag
.It Fl d Ar delay
Specifies the delay after which the last key entered will be repeated by the
Keyboard. Valid values are 0..3 corresponding to delays of 250, 500, 750 and
1000 milliseconds.
.It Fl l
Displays the current keyboard map in use by the driver.
.It Fl m Ar map
Specifies the map entry to be searched in the keyboard capabilities database
.Nm keycap.
The database is searched for the entry and if found, the mapping
is loaded and is used in the driver from then on.
.It Fl o
Switches display of control codes to octal in the listing of the current map.
To be used in conjunction with the
.Fl l
option.
.It Fl p
Uses 'pure' output when listing - the Escape character is displayed in either
octal or hexadecimal and not as 'ESC'. To be used in conjunction with the
.Fl l
option.
.It Fl r Ar rate
Specifies the character repetition rate. Valid argument values are 0...31
corresponding to rates of 30 characters/second ... 2 characters/second.
.It Fl R
Reset the Keyboard.
.It Fl s
Displays the current settings of the rate and delay values.
.It Fl t Ar +/-
Specify this option to enable (
.Ar +
) or disable (
.Ar -
) the repetition of keys.
.It Fl x
Switches display of control codes to hexadecimal in the listing of the current map.
To be used in conjunction with the
.Fl l
option. This is the default behaviour.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /usr/share/misc/keycap.pcvt -compact
.It Pa /usr/share/misc/keycap.pcvt
Keyboard capabilities data base file if nothing else was chosen during installation.
.It Pa /dev/console
Keyboard raw device.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr keycap 3 ,
.Xr keycap 5
.Sh BUGS
.Nm kcon
detects several inconsistencies in the keycap database. In case of errors
.Nm kcon
exits with an error message. If this happens, the keyboard may remain in
an undefined state. To recover from such situation, execute
.Nm kcon -m default
.Sh EXAMPLES
The command
.Dq Li kcon -m gb
loads the entry 'gb' from the keycap file into the keyboard to switch to
a british keyboard behaviour.

The command
.Dq Li kcon -r 0 -d 0
switches the keyboard to emit characters at a rate of 30 characters per second
after a key has been held down for 250 milliseconds.

@- remove all trailing whitespace
     * except when it is escaped with a `\' at the end of the line
- fix remaining .Nm usage as well
- this is from a patch I received from kwesterback@@home.com, who has been
  working on some scripts for fixing formatting errors in mdoc'd man pages

Ok, so there could be a cost/benefit debate with this commit, but since I have
the patch we might as well commit it...

@Update the SMP branch to -current, this breaks the SMP branch though.
But it will be fixed soonish.  Note, nothing new has happened, this is just
a merge of the trunk into this branch.

1.7.4.2
log
@Merge in -current from two days ago in the SMP branch.
As usual with merges, they do not indicate progress, so do not hold
your breath for working SMP, and do not mail me and ask about the
state of it.  It has not changed.  There is work ongoing, but very, very
slowly.  The commit is done in parts as to not lock up the tree in too
big chunks at a time.

log
@The proper order of the ``introductory'' macros in a man page is .Dd/.Dt/.Os.
Out of the approximately 1450 man pages, only about 90 of them were wrong.
Thanks to kwesterback@@home.com for coming up with a script and patch to repair
this. The patch also inserted a .Os macro in the few man pages that were
missing one.
