.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm scon
utility controls several aspects of the runtime behaviour of the pcvt vt220
driver.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a
Returns a string describing the video adaptor found by pcvt, the string
returned could be MDA, HGC, CGA, EGA, VGA or UNKNOWN.
.It Fl b
Set the number of scrollback buffer pages to
.Ar num .
The minimum value is 2, maximum 100.
.It Fl c
Specify the screen number the current (displayed) screen should be switched
to.
.It Fl d
Specify the device filename (i.e. /dev/ttyC2) further operations specified on
the command line should be applied to.
.It Fl f
Some programs which silently assume 24 lines when they run on a VT220 show
incorrect behaviour when the terminal has really 25 lines. To support full
VT220 behaviour, it is possible to force pcvt to select only 24 lines when
it is running in 25-lines pure VT mode. The
.Fl f
option requires one additional parameter, the string 'on' or 'off' to switch
this mode for a virtual screen on or off respectively. This mode has no effect
if any other vertical resolutions are selected than the two above mentioned.
.It Fl h
Prints a usage/help text.
.It Fl l
Lists the current configuration of runtime changeable options and fixed
parameters (such as the type of the adaptor, and in case of a VGA adaptor,
the Manufacturer, Chipset and 132 column support) of the output portion
of the pcvt driver.
.It Fl m
Returns a string describing the connected display monitor type found by pcvt,
the string returned can be MONO, COLOR or UNKNOWN.
.It Fl v
Specify verbose operation of the program.
.It Fl o
Toggle
.Dq legacy
pcvt mode with traditional PC display mode.
As of
.Ox 2.6 ,
character mapping is turned off by default in favour of a traditional PC
display with 16 colors and the standard IBM font.
This option has no effect in line modes other than 25.
.It Fl s
Specify the number of character lines on the screen. Possible parameters are
25, 28, 35, 40, 43 or 50. To use all this screen sizes, the fonts required
for proper operation of a desired size have to be downloaded to the EGA/VGA
font ram. This option is available only for EGA and VGA boards.
.It Fl p
Modify VGA palette
.Pq DAC .
The
.Fl p
option is mutually exclusive with
.Fl s .
Naturally, option
.Fl p
is available only for VGA boards. Three flavors are available.

If used with argument
.Dq Ar default ,
this flag will restore the default palette
.Po
as installed by VGA ROM BIOS after hardware reset
.Pc .

If used with argument
.Dq Ar list ,
the current VGA DAC palette entries are listed. Each entry contains
the table index, values for red, green, and blue, and if there's a
known name for this entry, the color name. Trailing empty table
slots (RGB values all zero) are omitted.

Otherwise, four comma-separated arguments are expected. The first
denotes the number of palette entry to be modified. This may be either
a number between 0 and 255, or the usual name of an associated color
.Pq case-insensitive .
The following values for red, green and blue are restricted to 0 through 63
due to VGA DAC conventions.
Note that the first delimiter within such an argument may be a colon
.Dq \&:
instead of a comma
.Dq \&,
for better readability, but this violates common command argument
conventions.
Multiple
.Fl p
options may be specified if unambiguous.
.It Fl t
Specifying
.Fl t
will activate the screen saver. The behaviour depends on
.Ar timeout :
if
.Ar timeout
is given as 0, the screen saver is turned off. Otherwise,
.Ar timeout
is taken as a number of seconds to wait until activating the
screen saver.
NOTE: the
.Fl t
option is only available if screen saver support has been compiled into
the driver !
.It Fl 1
Sets 132 columns mode
.Pq only available on VGA adaptors .
.It Fl 8
Sets 80 columns mode.
.El
.Pp
When switching the force 24 lines mode on and off,
or when switching between 80 and 132 columns operation,
the screen is cleared, the scrolling
region is reset and the cursor is placed in the home position.
.Sh EXAMPLES
Invoking
.Do
.Li scon Fl p
.Ar lightgray,0,15,0
.Fl p
.Ar 0:45,45,45
.Dc
will result in green on gray output for normal text.
Note that normal text color is light gray, and not white as one might expect.
.Sh BUGS
The
.Fl c
and
.Fl d
options collide somehow, this will change in a future release.

@Merge in -current from two days ago in the SMP branch.
As usual with merges, they do not indicate progress, so do not hold
your breath for working SMP, and do not mail me and ask about the
state of it.  It has not changed.  There is work ongoing, but very, very
slowly.  The commit is done in parts as to not lock up the tree in too
big chunks at a time.

log
@- Add support for a traditional PC display (16 colors and use the standard IBM
font) and make it the default mode. This is more or less a hack, since pcvt
was developed only to be a vt220 terminal emulator.
- Document new default mode in pcvt(4).
- Add -o option to scon(1) for toggling between the new and legacy modes.

Ok, so there could be a cost/benefit debate with this commit, but since I have
the patch we might as well commit it...

@The proper order of the ``introductory'' macros in a man page is .Dd/.Dt/.Os.
Out of the approximately 1450 man pages, only about 90 of them were wrong.
Thanks to kwesterback@@home.com for coming up with a script and patch to repair
this. The patch also inserted a .Os macro in the few man pages that were
missing one.
