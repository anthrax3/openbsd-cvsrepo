.Sh NAME
.Nm kgetent ,
.Nm kgetnum ,
.Nm kgetflag ,
.Nm kgetstr
.Nd routines for accessing the keycap database
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fn kgetent "char *bp" "char *name"
.Fn kgetnum "char *id"
.Fn kgetflag "char *id"
.Ft char *
.Fn kgetstr "char *id" "char *area"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
These functions extract and use capabilities from a keyboard capability data
base, usually
.Pa /usr/share/misc/keycap.pcvt ,
the format of which is described in
.Xr keycap 5 .
.Pp
The
.Fn kgetent
function
extracts the entry for keyboard mapping
.Fa name
into the buffer at
.Fa bp .
The
.Fa bp
argument
should be a character buffer of size
1024 and must be retained through all subsequent calls to
.Fn kgetnum ,
.Fn kgetflag ,
and
.Fn kgetstr .
The
.Fn kgetent
function
returns \-1 if none of the
.Nm keycap
data base files could be opened,
0 if the map name given does not have an entry,
and 1 if all goes well.
.Pp
The
.Fn kgetnum
function
gets the numeric value of capability
.Fa id ,
returning \-1 if is not given for the map.
.Pp
The
.Fn kgetflag
function
returns 1 if the specified capability is present in
the map's entry, 0 if it is not.
.Pp
The
.Fn kgetstr
function
returns the string value of the capability
.Fa id ,
places it in the buffer at
.Fa area ,
and advances the
.Fa area
pointer.
The
.Fn kgetstr
function
returns
.Dv NULL
if the capability was not found.

@The proper order of the ``introductory'' macros in a man page is .Dd/.Dt/.Os.
Out of the approximately 1450 man pages, only about 90 of them were wrong.
Thanks to kwesterback@@home.com for coming up with a script and patch to repair
this. The patch also inserted a .Os macro in the few man pages that were
missing one.

log
@Merge in -current from two days ago in the SMP branch.
As usual with merges, they do not indicate progress, so do not hold
your breath for working SMP, and do not mail me and ask about the
state of it.  It has not changed.  There is work ongoing, but very, very
slowly.  The commit is done in parts as to not lock up the tree in too
big chunks at a time.
