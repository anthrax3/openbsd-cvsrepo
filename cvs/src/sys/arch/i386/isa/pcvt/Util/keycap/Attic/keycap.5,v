.Sh NAME
.Nm keycap
.Nd keyboard mapping data base
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm keycap
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm keycap
file
is a data base describing keyboard mappings, used by
.Xr kcon 1 .
.Pp
Entries in
.Nm keycap
consist of a number of `:'-separated fields.
The first entry for each mapping gives the names that are known for the
mapping, separated by `|' characters.
All names but the first and last
should be in lower case and contain no blanks;
the last name may well contain
upper case and blanks for readability.
.Sh CAPABILITIES
.Bl -column indent indent
.Sy Name	Type	Description
.It "de	bool	Resets Keyboard mapping to compiled-in default"
.It "D<n>	bool	Disables key <n> completely"

.It "m<n>	num	specify key numbers for ALT keys
.It "l<n>	num	specify key numbers for ALTGR keys
.It "h<n>	num	specify key numbers for SHIFT keys
.It "t<n>	num	specify key numbers for CONTROL keys
.It "ca<n>	num	specify key number for the CAPS LOCK key
.It "sh<n>	num	specify key number for the SHIFT LOCK key
.It "nl<n>	num	specify key number for the NUM LOCK key
.It "sc<n>	num	specify key number for the SCROLL LOCK key

.It "K<n>	str	bind a string to a unshifted (normal) key
.It "S<n>	str	bind a string to a shifted key
.It "C<n>	str	bind a string to a control key
.It "A<n>	str	bind a string to a altgr key

.It "tc	str	Entry of similar map \- must be last."
.El

Parameter <n> describing the key number can have values from 1 to 128.

A string parameter may have up to 15 characters.

.Pp
.Ss A Sample Entry
The following entry, which describes a test entry, is among the very
easy entries in the
.Nm keycap
file as of this writing.
.Pp
.Bd -literal
tt\||test\||Test entry which swaps y and z:\e
	:K22=z:S22=Z:C22=\e032:\e
	:K46=y:S46=Y:C46=\e031:

.Ed
.Pp
Entries may continue onto multiple lines by giving a \e as the last
character of a line. Comments may be included on lines beginning with
.Sq # .
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /usr/share/misc/keycap.pcvt -compact
.It Pa /usr/share/misc/keycap.pcvt
contains keyboard mapping descriptions
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr kcon 1 ,
.Xr keycap 3
.Sh EXAMPLES
The entry
.Dq Li l1#60
sets the keynumber for the ALTGR key to 60.

The entry
.Dq Li K100=hugo
binds the string 'hugo' to the key number 100.

The entry
.Dq Li K100=^D
binds the control character EOT (0x04) to the key number 100.

The entry
.Dq Li K100=\e000
binds the control character NUL (0x00) to the key number 100.

@- remove all trailing whitespace
     * except when it is escaped with a `\' at the end of the line
- fix remaining .Nm usage as well
- this is from a patch I received from kwesterback@@home.com, who has been
  working on some scripts for fixing formatting errors in mdoc'd man pages

Ok, so there could be a cost/benefit debate with this commit, but since I have
the patch we might as well commit it...

log
@Merge in -current from two days ago in the SMP branch.
As usual with merges, they do not indicate progress, so do not hold
your breath for working SMP, and do not mail me and ask about the
state of it.  It has not changed.  There is work ongoing, but very, very
slowly.  The commit is done in parts as to not lock up the tree in too
big chunks at a time.

@The proper order of the ``introductory'' macros in a man page is .Dd/.Dt/.Os.
Out of the approximately 1450 man pages, only about 90 of them were wrong.
Thanks to kwesterback@@home.com for coming up with a script and patch to repair
this. The patch also inserted a .Os macro in the few man pages that were
missing one.
