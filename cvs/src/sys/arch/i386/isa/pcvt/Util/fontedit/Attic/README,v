@When I first saw this posted to rn, I tried to compile this on a machine 
running BSD UNIX.  Much to my dissapointment, It said "unable to find
/usr/include/termio.h" and thus it sat for a couple months.  I was able to
compile it on a 3b5, but I didn't have a vt220 hooked up to it.  I was doing
some unrelated work with ioctl calls and finally realized that it would not be
too hard to convert it from System V to BSD.  It also looked kind of strange
with the cursor on, so I turned this off.  To implement this, compile with
the "-DCURFIX" flag in the Makefile.  
I am working on a new version that uses curses and that would enable you to 
change the file that your are working on without leaving the program.  
I thought I'd post it as it is now, since it has a lot of uses right away.
Imagine changing your favorite game to have objects that look like what they 
are instead of the regular characters.  Also, I think people should post their
own character sets, if they come up with some neat stuff. 
             Please send any comments or suggestions to:

@Merge in -current from two days ago in the SMP branch.
As usual with merges, they do not indicate progress, so do not hold
your breath for working SMP, and do not mail me and ask about the
state of it.  It has not changed.  There is work ongoing, but very, very
slowly.  The commit is done in parts as to not lock up the tree in too
big chunks at a time.
