@- remove all trailing whitespace
     * except when it is escaped with a `\' at the end of the line
- fix remaining .Nm usage as well
- this is from a patch I received from kwesterback@@home.com, who has been
  working on some scripts for fixing formatting errors in mdoc'd man pages

Ok, so there could be a cost/benefit debate with this commit, but since I have
the patch we might as well commit it...

@Merge in -current from two days ago in the SMP branch.
As usual with merges, they do not indicate progress, so do not hold
your breath for working SMP, and do not mail me and ask about the
state of it.  It has not changed.  There is work ongoing, but very, very
slowly.  The commit is done in parts as to not lock up the tree in too
big chunks at a time.

@The proper order of the ``introductory'' macros in a man page is .Dd/.Dt/.Os.
Out of the approximately 1450 man pages, only about 90 of them were wrong.
Thanks to kwesterback@@home.com for coming up with a script and patch to repair
this. The patch also inserted a .Os macro in the few man pages that were
missing one.
