@Redo the ICU interrupt handling system to better emulate an APIC system.
This is done by representing the current blockings of interrupts with
a priority level instead of an interrupt mask.  This makes it possible to
share implementations for spl* functions/macros between both ICU
and APIC (a must when going MP) systems.  In this process, assign
soft interrupts their own levels to match the way things will be on
APIC systems where they actually will be real interrupts and not just
bits in a pending mask as they are now.
Heavily inspired by Bill Studenmunds SMP work in NetBSD

@from netbsd:
Deal with GCC's dead code elimination being suboptimal.
Modify splraise() to allow better optimization.
Make cpl, ipending, and astpending volatile.
Make sure interrupts are disabled before jumping to a resume point,
to prevent races.
Make FPU faults use INTRFASTEXIT, and remove INTREXIT.
Build the frame for recursive interrupts manually, and make sure to
disable interrupts to avoid races.
