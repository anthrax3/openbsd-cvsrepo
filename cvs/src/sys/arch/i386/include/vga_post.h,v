log
@Add vga bios repost support. Fetched from the NetBSD tree mostly.

Tested on multiple i386 and it works, amd64 works also with a few
exceptions that will get fixed.

The initial effort of importing was done by oga@@, thanks!

Lots of testing and debugging by mlarkin@@ and me.
Okay deraadt@@, oga@@, mlarkin@@.
