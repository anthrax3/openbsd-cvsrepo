log
@First pass at removing clauses 3 and 4 from NetBSD licenses.

Not sure what's more surprising: how long it took for NetBSD to
catch up to the rest of the BSDs (including UCB), or the amount of
code that NetBSD has claimed for itself without attributing to the
actual authors.

@Renumber I/O APICs who clash with other APICs. Also clear the delivery
mode before setting it to fixed, since the MP BIOS may have left something
in that field. This fixed a Quad Xeon we have been loaned over the c2k4.
