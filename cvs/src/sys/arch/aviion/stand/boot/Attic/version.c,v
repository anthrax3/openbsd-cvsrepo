@Merge old netboot le(4) code into new boot, to allow for a kernel to be loaded
from the network, with symbols. This will be useful to load bsd.rd on systems
with the 3MB bootfile limit in the stupid PROM. Crank version to 0.4.

@Misc cleanups and small fixes. Boot controller/unit/lun information passed
to the kernel will now match the device the kernel is loaded from, not the
device the boot blocks are loaded from (this allows one to netboot the
boot blocks to boot a kernel from a local disk).

1.1
log
@Early stages of a working disk bootloader for OpenBSD/aviion.
Currently limited to oosiop(4) controllers, and thus models 4600 and 530.
There are some rough edges to polish to avoid manual interaction (kernel
currently can't figure its boot device when booted from disk), but the hard
(and hair-pulling) work is over.
And we can have kernel symbols again!
