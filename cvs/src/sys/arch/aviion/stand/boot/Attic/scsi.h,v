@Support for oaic in the boot blocks. Cope with older prom putting a \r at
the end of the commandline. Clean up a few stale comments. Crank boot blocks
version to 0.3.

1.3
log
@Misc cleanups and small fixes. Boot controller/unit/lun information passed
to the kernel will now match the device the kernel is loaded from, not the
device the boot blocks are loaded from (this allows one to netboot the
boot blocks to boot a kernel from a local disk).

@Move common SCSI defines and structs to their own header, to eventually allow
SCSI tape support.

Drop sync negotiation from oosiop code, we can run without it.
