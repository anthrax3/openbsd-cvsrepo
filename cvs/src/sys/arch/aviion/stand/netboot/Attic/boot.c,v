@Merge old netboot le(4) code into new boot, to allow for a kernel to be loaded
from the network, with symbols. This will be useful to load bsd.rd on systems
with the 3MB bootfile limit in the stupid PROM. Crank version to 0.4.

log
@Early stages of a working disk bootloader for OpenBSD/aviion.
Currently limited to oosiop(4) controllers, and thus models 4600 and 530.
There are some rough edges to polish to avoid manual interaction (kernel
currently can't figure its boot device when booted from disk), but the hard
(and hair-pulling) work is over.
And we can have kernel symbols again!

log
@Parse commandline options in netboot, and force the onboard ethernet address
to be 00:00:00:00:00:00 if `-z' is passed; this allows netboot to work on a
machine which has lost its nvram (despite the ethernet address not being
stored in nvram at all, stupid prom can't be bothered to get it right...).
Crank netboot version.

@Network bootloader for AV400 series, will load a native kernel. Still some
rough edges to sort out, but enough to successfully boot a kernel.
Will not work on series 530 yet.
