1.1
log
@Early stages of a working disk bootloader for OpenBSD/aviion.
Currently limited to oosiop(4) controllers, and thus models 4600 and 530.
There are some rough edges to polish to avoid manual interaction (kernel
currently can't figure its boot device when booted from disk), but the hard
(and hair-pulling) work is over.
And we can have kernel symbols again!
