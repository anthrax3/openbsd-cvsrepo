@Massive overhauling of the m88k pmap, though I can't pretend it's a new pmap
since a large part of the structures and logic remains.

Since m88k has separate supervisor/user spaces, we can map physical memory 1:1
in supervisor space, and have the kernel virtual address space start from the
end of physical memory.

This allows us to switch to __HAVE_PMAP_DIRECT. And to get rid of the double
mapped sdt, since now their virtual and physical addresses will always match.

The upper bound of the kernel virtual memory space is now platform dependent,
until the code which relies upon some hardware devices being mapped 1:1 in
supervisor mode is updated to no longer require this (this is mainly a PITA on
luna88k, where onboard devices start at 0x40000000, leaving only 1GB of KVA at
the moment - still much better than the previous 512MB).

Tested on mvme88k only (187, 188, 197LE, 197DP). Other platforms ought to
work, aviion will be checked shortly and fixed if necessary. No known
OpenBSD/luna88k system in working condition at the moment.

@More reworking of interrupt handling and VME support, and rename various
board-specific defines to prevent any risk of collision. This also adds
clock support for AV530 family, and timecounter support (cio code sync'ed
with mvme88k). And various bugs fixed in the process.

This is enough to get models 4600 and 530 to run multiuser with a Hawk
Ethernet VME card (the onboard Ethernet is not supported yet, coming soon).
There is no way to share a disk with DG/UX yet, the kernel (and fdisk(8))
needs to become aware of its ways.

@Overhaul interrupt handling, in order to make it (arguably) simpler and
more board design-independent.

The main changes are:
- define logical interrupt sources, which match the on-board devices as
  well as the seven VME interrupt sources. Use these whenever possible
  when registering interrupts in the drivers, so that the actual interrupt
  mask layouts are hidden.
- make the on-board and VME interrupt handlers separate. On-board interrupt
  handlers are not really associated to an interrupt vector, only to a
  given interrupt source, and only one handler can be registered for a
  logical interrupt source. On the other hand, VME interrupts come with a
  vector number, and can be shared. This allows VME devices to really use
  the whole 256 vectors space, starting at vector zero.
- update the real interrupt masks upon interrupt handler registration and
  removal, so that only interrupt sources for which a handler exists may
  be enabled.
- update the VME interrupt allocation logic to allow exclusive vector
  allocation.
- move the Z8536 clock routines to their own file, since they are not
  AV400-specific; while there, calibrate the delay constant upon startup
  for more accurate delay().

The vme driver is the only one left with AV400 tentacles left, to be fixed
very soon.
