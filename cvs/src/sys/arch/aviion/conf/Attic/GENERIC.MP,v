log
@SMP support for models 4600 and 530, adapted from the MVME188 code. Models
4000 and 4300 will need more work, because they don't have as many distinct
software interrupt sources as required by this implementation, so a
different IPI scheme will be necessary.

Tested on dual-processor 4625 (AV530 family) and single processor 4300
(AV400 family).
