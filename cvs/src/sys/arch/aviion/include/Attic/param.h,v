@refactor sys/param.h and machine/param.h.  A lot of #ifdef _KERNEL is added
to keep definitions our of user space.  The MD files now follow a consistant
order -- all namespace intrusion is at the tail can be cleaned up
independently.  locore, bootblocks, and libkvm still see enough visibility to
build.  Checked on 90% of platforms...

@Introduce a ``struct board'' platform abstraction, to be able to support
more AViiON designs in the future.
Heuristics to tell designs apart in aviion_identify() are likely too weak,
but this is a start and AV400 still gets identified as AV400 (-:
