@Massive overhauling of the m88k pmap, though I can't pretend it's a new pmap
since a large part of the structures and logic remains.

Since m88k has separate supervisor/user spaces, we can map physical memory 1:1
in supervisor space, and have the kernel virtual address space start from the
end of physical memory.

This allows us to switch to __HAVE_PMAP_DIRECT. And to get rid of the double
mapped sdt, since now their virtual and physical addresses will always match.

The upper bound of the kernel virtual memory space is now platform dependent,
until the code which relies upon some hardware devices being mapped 1:1 in
supervisor mode is updated to no longer require this (this is mainly a PITA on
luna88k, where onboard devices start at 0x40000000, leaving only 1GB of KVA at
the moment - still much better than the previous 512MB).

Tested on mvme88k only (187, 188, 197LE, 197DP). Other platforms ought to
work, aviion will be checked shortly and fixed if necessary. No known
OpenBSD/luna88k system in working condition at the moment.

@Enter OpenBSD/aviion, a port to the m88k-based Data General AViiON workstations. Currently restricted to diskless serial console, tested on AV410 only; many thanks to Chris Tribo for documentation and testing.
