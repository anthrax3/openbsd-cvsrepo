@Overhaul interrupt handling, in order to make it (arguably) simpler and
more board design-independent.

The main changes are:
- define logical interrupt sources, which match the on-board devices as
  well as the seven VME interrupt sources. Use these whenever possible
  when registering interrupts in the drivers, so that the actual interrupt
  mask layouts are hidden.
- make the on-board and VME interrupt handlers separate. On-board interrupt
  handlers are not really associated to an interrupt vector, only to a
  given interrupt source, and only one handler can be registered for a
  logical interrupt source. On the other hand, VME interrupts come with a
  vector number, and can be shared. This allows VME devices to really use
  the whole 256 vectors space, starting at vector zero.
- update the real interrupt masks upon interrupt handler registration and
  removal, so that only interrupt sources for which a handler exists may
  be enabled.
- update the VME interrupt allocation logic to allow exclusive vector
  allocation.
- move the Z8536 clock routines to their own file, since they are not
  AV400-specific; while there, calibrate the delay constant upon startup
  for more accurate delay().

The vme driver is the only one left with AV400 tentacles left, to be fixed
very soon.

@Enter OpenBSD/aviion, a port to the m88k-based Data General AViiON workstations. Currently restricted to diskless serial console, tested on AV410 only; many thanks to Chris Tribo for documentation and testing.
