log
@Some of our fan scaling calculations with the muK temperature unit above
59 degC require temporary values larger than 32bit signed.  Therefore
bump those involved variables to int64_t and replace imin/imax with
ulmin/ulmax to get proper results.

@Add a thermal management framework for macppc which controls the fan speed
based on the temperature sensor values.  A driver can register it fans or
temperature sensors there.  Ported from FreeBSD.
