1.1
log
@Add blinkenlights(4) a driver to control the 16 leds found on the front
panel of the Xserve G4 and G5. The leds will provide an indication of the
system load slowing as the load climbs, and system health e.g. no
lights means its dead or in DDB.

Split some of the shared registers and clock divisors from i2s into
i2sreg.h while there nuke some evil C++ style comments.
Man page to follow shortly.
