@Factorize akbd and ams drivers between mac68k and macppc; while there, start
moving out common adb code as well, and merge adb_direct.c into adb.c to
simplify external header files.

No functional change; more cleanups to come.

@The "powerpc" port which has supported the newer Apple Macintosh powerpc based
is being renamed to macppc. This is to allow sharing of common code
between different powerpc base platforms.

Most of the work involved in the renaming process was performed by miod@@

Files moved from powerpc/mac to macppc/dev
