@Unify the zs tty driver.

Most of the hard work by mpi@@, who provided the initial diff.
Fixes for sparc from myself. Tested on sgi and sparc myself.
Compiles and detects zstty on my powerbook, compile tested on
sparc64 by me. Real testing with zs device on sparc64 by miod@@
who also gave a lot of help and feedback.

ok miod@@, mpi@@

@Serial console support for macppc. Serial console will work if the modem
has been replaced with a serial port adapter on any machine that has
a real serial port internally. This will also power on the internal modem
for keylargo based machines (tested on original PBG4) when the serial port
is open. ok miod@@
