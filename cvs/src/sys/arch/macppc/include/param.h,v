@refactor sys/param.h and machine/param.h.  A lot of #ifdef _KERNEL is added
to keep definitions our of user space.  The MD files now follow a consistant
order -- all namespace intrusion is at the tail can be cleaned up
independently.  locore, bootblocks, and libkvm still see enough visibility to
build.  Checked on 90% of platforms...

@make nkmempages dynamic based on memory. okay art@@ from netbsd:
date: 2000/02/11 19:22:52;  author: thorpej;
Add some very simple code to auto-size the kmem_map.  We take the
amount of physical memory, divide it by 4, and then allow machine
dependent code to place upper and lower bounds on the size.  Export
the computed value to userspace via the new "vm.nkmempages" sysctl.

NKMEMCLUSTERS is now deprecated and will generate an error if you
attempt to use it.  The new option, should you choose to use it,
is called NKMEMPAGES, and two new options NKMEMPAGES_MIN and
NKMEMPAGES_MAX allow the user to configure the bounds in the kernel
config file.

@The "powerpc" port which has supported the newer Apple Macintosh powerpc based
is being renamed to macppc. This is to allow sharing of common code
between different powerpc base platforms.

Most of the work involved in the renaming process was performed by miod@@

Files moved from powerpc/include to macppc/include
Some files were not "moved" but wrapper files were created which include
the powerpc/include version.

Several of the powerpc/include files where changed to reflect that they
are POWERPC_* not MACHINE_*.
