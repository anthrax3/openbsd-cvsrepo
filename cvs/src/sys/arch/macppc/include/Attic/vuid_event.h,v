1.2
log
@These files were intended for X11 support, but serve no purpose nowadays,
as sparc* do not use Xsun-compatible event interface anymore, and alpha only
used this for Xtga which we do not ship anymore.

Discussed long ago with matthieu@@

1.1
log
@The "powerpc" port which has supported the newer Apple Macintosh powerpc based
is being renamed to macppc. This is to allow sharing of common code
between different powerpc base platforms.

Most of the work involved in the renaming process was performed by miod@@

Files moved from powerpc/include to macppc/include
Some files were not "moved" but wrapper files were created which include
the powerpc/include version.

Several of the powerpc/include files where changed to reflect that they
are POWERPC_* not MACHINE_*.
