@No need to include <sys/lock.h> when only <sys/rwlock.h> is needed,
so remove the former and include the latter instead of pulling it
in <dev/pci/agpvar.h>.  This header already requires various other
types anyway.  While here remove unneeded headers.

@Add support for Uninorth AGP bridges found in most if not all the macppc
machines with a G3 or G4 microprocessor. It would not be difficult to add
support for U3 bridges found in G5 powered macppc to this driver but I
don't have such hardware.
