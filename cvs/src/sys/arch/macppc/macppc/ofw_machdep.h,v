@Remove a lie, the early boot console does not need any mapping.

In fact we even use the firmware interface for "bsd -c" and "bsd -d".
So do the necessary firmware calls before calling initppc() to be able
to use printf() really early in the boot sequence.

@Move the early framebuffer initialization code outside of vgafb(4)
and introduce a function to get the cursor position an unmap the
stolen memory region when switching to the real framebuffer.

For the moment we still reuse the original region but this allows
me to move forward and it buys us the posibility to have an early
framebuffer without vgafb (i.e. radeondrm(4) only).

@Only allow the memory and mmio regions to be mmap()'ed at their real

While here simplify the console attachement logic and removed some
unused global variables. Tested by matthieu@@ and myself on various
different G3 and G4 models.

@- in the OpenFirmware console initialisation, check if the console device
has support for backlight control (laptops do, and probably machines with
a built-in monitor do as well).
- provide a function to set the screen brightness as well.
- use both changes above to add a screen blanker to the vgafb driver
- let the screen brightness and backlight be controlled via wsconsctl
- clean dust, KNF, and more symbolic names in the vgafb driver to make it
better readable

Initial code by myself, with some hacks from drahn@@ later.
