log
@Import fixcoff from NetBSD and make some changes to boot.mac Makefile and
ofwboot including loosing some meanigless defines and repurposing
XCOFF_GLUE to my own ends. These changes make it possible to boot the
OpenBSD kernel on at least the Power Macintosh 9500 and 9600. No binary
change in stripped ofwboot.

1.1
log
@The "powerpc" port which has supported the newer Apple Macintosh powerpc based
is being renamed to macppc. This is to allow sharing of common code
between different powerpc base platforms.

Most of the work involved in the renaming process was performed by miod@@

Files moved from powerpc/stand/boot.mac to macppc/stand/boot.mac
These files are the bootloader for the older Openfirmware, not currently
supported.
