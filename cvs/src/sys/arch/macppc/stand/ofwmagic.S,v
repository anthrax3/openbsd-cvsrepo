1.2
log
@First pass at removing clauses 3 and 4 from NetBSD licenses.

Not sure what's more surprising: how long it took for NetBSD to
catch up to the rest of the BSDs (including UCB), or the amount of
code that NetBSD has claimed for itself without attributing to the
actual authors.

OK deraadt@@

log
@The "powerpc" port which has supported the newer Apple Macintosh powerpc based
is being renamed to macppc. This is to allow sharing of common code
between different powerpc base platforms.

Most of the work involved in the renaming process was performed by miod@@

Files moved from powerpc/stand to macppc/stand
