log
@Retire hp300, mvme68k and mvme88k ports. These ports have no users, keeping
this hardware alive is becoming increasingly difficult, and I should heed the
message sent by the three disks which have died on me over the last few days.

Noone sane will mourn these ports anyway. So long, and thanks for the fish.

@Move struct evcount inside struct intrhand, and modernize intrhand

Also remove unused haltvec structures and related code.

@Kill ca_master in autoconf structures. Drivers either only attach to one
specific bus (mc/pcc/pcctwo), or they know it from the ca_bustype value,
and can use the globals sys_busname variables.

This also allows for some code simplifications.
