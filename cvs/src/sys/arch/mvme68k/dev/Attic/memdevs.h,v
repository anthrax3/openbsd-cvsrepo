@Retire hp300, mvme68k and mvme88k ports. These ports have no users, keeping

message sent by the three disks which have died on me over the last few days.

Noone sane will mourn these ports anyway. So long, and thanks for the fish.

@Prefer vaddr_t and paddr_t types in device softc, instead of void * and
heavy casts. Improves readability, no functional change.
