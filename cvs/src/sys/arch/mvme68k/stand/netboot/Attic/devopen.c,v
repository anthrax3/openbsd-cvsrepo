log
@Retire hp300, mvme68k and mvme88k ports. These ports have no users, keeping
this hardware alive is becoming increasingly difficult, and I should heed the
message sent by the three disks which have died on me over the last few days.

Noone sane will mourn these ports anyway. So long, and thanks for the fish.

log
@Switch mvme68k boot blocks to use the MI libsa loadfile routines to load
kernel images, instead of their own; gives us the ability to load ELF kernels
for free.

Fix many warnings, and generally make the code closer to the current mvme88k
boot blocks to help diffability.

Rewrite bugcrt and bugexec() as a short assembly shim around a
compiler-independent C block; this will allow compilers other than gcc2 to be
used, and removes the need for bugcrt to be compiled without optimization.

Crank all bootblocks versions.
