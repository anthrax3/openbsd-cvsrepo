@Retire hp300, mvme68k and mvme88k ports. These ports have no users, keeping
this hardware alive is becoming increasingly difficult, and I should heed the
message sent by the three disks which have died on me over the last few days.

Noone sane will mourn these ports anyway. So long, and thanks for the fish.

.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm installboot
.Nd install a bootstrap on an FFS disk
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm installboot
.Op Fl nv
.Ar boot
.Ar bootxx
.Ar rawdev
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm installboot
is used to install a "first-stage" boot program into the boot area
of an FFS disk partition, and initialize the table of block numbers the
.Ar bootxx
program uses to load the second-stage boot program.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width flag
.It Fl n
Do not actually write anything on the disk.
.It Fl v
Be verbose, printing out the block numbers that
.Ar bootxx
will use to load
.Ar boot .
.El
.Pp
The arguments are:
.Bl -tag -width bootxx
.It Ar boot
The name of the second-stage boot program in the file system
where the first-stage boot program is to be installed.
.It Ar bootxx
The name of the prototype file for the first stage boot program.
.It Ar rawdev
The name of the raw device in which the first-stage boot program
is to be installed.
This should correspond to the block device on which the file system containing
.Ar boot
is mounted.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Bd -literal
# cp /usr/mdec/bootsd /boot
# /usr/mdec/installboot /boot /usr/mdec/bootxx /dev/rsd0a

.Nm installboot
requires simultaneous access to the mounted file system and
the raw device, but that is not allowed with the kernel
.Nm securelevel
variable set to a value greater than zero (the default), so
.Nm installboot
only works in single-user mode (or insecure mode - see
