1.3
log
@More cleanups:
- accept empty controller and partition numbers, as well as empty filenames,
  and use defaults (0, 0 and "bsd") instead of complaining the boot path
  is invalid.
- do not attempt to detect and report devices at boot, using a small
  list of possible devices (only scsi id #6 and #5, come on!).
  Instead, parse the user-supplied boot string to figure out which controller
  and device to talk to. (still no SCSI LUN support, though).

Because of the last change, SCSI unit numbers ought to match the PROM
numbering now (10 * controller + 6 - device id).

Crank version to 0.2.

1.2
log
@More cleanup and unused code or data removal.

Constify the bitmap font.

Bound check sd() numbers instead of accessing an array out of bounds (noticed
by aoyama@@).

Use the same SCSI select timeout as the kernel does (250ms instead of 2ms).

1.1
log
@The first steps of a native OpenBSD/luna88k bootloader. Able to boot ELF
kernels with symbols from disk or network.
Based upon the NetBSD/luna68k bootloader which got recently overhauled from
4.3BSD (thanks, tsutsui@@ !), updated to match the luna88k hardware layout
and turned into a polling-only binary.
Tested on luna88k (not -2) only so far.
