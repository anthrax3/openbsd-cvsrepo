1.1
log
@The first steps of a native OpenBSD/luna88k bootloader. Able to boot ELF
kernels with symbols from disk or network.
Based upon the NetBSD/luna68k bootloader which got recently overhauled from
4.3BSD (thanks, tsutsui@@ !), updated to match the luna88k hardware layout
and turned into a polling-only binary.
Tested on luna88k (not -2) only so far.
