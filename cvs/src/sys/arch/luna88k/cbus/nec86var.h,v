@Add an audio driver, necsb(4), for NEC PC-9801-86 sound board on
cbus(4).

This work is based on the source code of NetBSD/pc98, an unofficial
NetBSD port for NEC PC-9801 series, written about 16 years ago.
Thanks to NetBSD/pc98 porting staff for their work, especially NAGAO
Tadaaki and N. Honda who wrote the original driver.
