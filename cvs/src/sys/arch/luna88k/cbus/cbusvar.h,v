@Some modifications on cbus(4):

- Handle interrupt priority level (IPL_XXX) in cbus_isrdispatch().
- Add a function that returns the status of registered cbus(4) interrupt
  levels.

@Correct evcount_attach argument on cbus(4).

The third argument of evcount_attach() should point some permanent
variable, not an automatic variable.  Now "vmstat -i" correctly prints
C-bus interrupt level number as irq, on C-bus devices.

log
@Add an audio driver, necsb(4), for NEC PC-9801-86 sound board on
cbus(4).

This work is based on the source code of NetBSD/pc98, an unofficial
NetBSD port for NEC PC-9801 series, written about 16 years ago.
Thanks to NetBSD/pc98 porting staff for their work, especially NAGAO
Tadaaki and N. Honda who wrote the original driver.

log
@Move cbus.c, cbusvar.h, and pcex.c to new 'cbus' directory, to gather
'C-bus' device drivers in it.

More devices on cbus(4) will be added, hopefully :-)
