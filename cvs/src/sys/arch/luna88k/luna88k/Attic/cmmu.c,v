@Continue factorizing m88k common code, this time files in <arch>/<arch>
which were copied verbatim from mvme88k to luna88k.

This requires backing out syntactic sugar in mvme88k kernel configuration
files which would deduct the required processor types from the board models,
as the common code only depends upon the M88100 and M88110 defines.
