@We need to loose some weight.
If someone feels very opposed to this, the code is left in the Attic.
Just revive and _make_it_work_.

.Sh NAME
.Nm binpatch
.Nd examine and or modify initialized data in a binary file.
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm binpatch
.Op Fl b | Fl w | Fl l
.Op Fl o Ar offset
.Fl s Ar symname
.Op Fl r Ar value
.Ar binfile
.Nm binpatch
.Op Fl b | Fl w | Fl l
.Op Fl o Ar offset
.Fl a Ar addr
.Op Fl r Ar value
.Ar binfile
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm binpatch
is used to modify or examine the data associated with a symbol in a binary
file
.Ar binfile .
The flags
.Fl b ,
.Fl w
and
.Fl l
specify the size of the data to be modified or examined
(byte, word, and long, respectively). The
.Ar binfile
is scanned in search of the symbol
.Ar symname
(specified with the
.Fl s
flag)
If the symbol is found the current data and address are printed.  Next if the
.Fl r
flag has been given, the current data is replaced with that of
.Ar value .
.Pp
If the second form is used the address
.Ar addr
specified with the
.Fl a
flag is used as a direct address into the data section of the binary and
no symbol search is performed.
.Pp
The
.Fl o
flag specifies an offset in byte, word or long (
.Fl b
,
.Fl w
,
or
.Fl l
) units from the given locator (
.Fl s
or
.Fl a
) for
.Nm binpatch
to perform it's described actions.

@- remove all trailing whitespace
     * except when it is escaped with a `\' at the end of the line
- fix remaining .Nm usage as well
- this is from a patch I received from kwesterback@@home.com, who has been
  working on some scripts for fixing formatting errors in mdoc'd man pages

Ok, so there could be a cost/benefit debate with this commit, but since I have
the patch we might as well commit it...

@Update the SMP branch to -current, this breaks the SMP branch though.
But it will be fixed soonish.  Note, nothing new has happened, this is just
a merge of the trunk into this branch.
