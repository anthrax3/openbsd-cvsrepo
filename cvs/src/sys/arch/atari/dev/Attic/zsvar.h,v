@We need to loose some weight.

 * The zs chip has insufficient buffering, so we provide a software
 * buffer using a two-level interrupt scheme.  The hardware (high priority)
 * interrupt simply grabs the `cause' of the interrupt and stuffs it into
 * a ring buffer.  It then schedules a software interrupt; the latter
 * empties the ring as fast as it can, hoping to avoid overflow.
 *
 * Interrupts can happen because of:
 *	- received data;
 *	- transmit pseudo-DMA done; and
 *	- status change.
 * These are all stored together in the (single) ring.  The size of the
 * ring is a power of two, to make % operations fast.  Since we need two
 * bits to distinguish the interrupt type, and up to 16 for the received
 * data plus RR1 status, we use 32 bits per ring entry.
 *
 * When the value is a character + RR1 status, the character is in the
 * upper 8 bits of the RR1 status.
