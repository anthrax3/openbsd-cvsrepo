@Delete cross references to boot_landisk(8).
According to tobiasu@@, landisk is moribund and writing new manual
pages for it would be a waste of time.

.Sh NAME
.Nm mbr
.Nd LANDISK-specific Master Boot Record
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm MBR
program comprises only one sector (512 bytes) and includes
a partition table, since the disk is located in the 0th sector of the disk.
Upon receiving control from the system firmware
.Nm
will scan the partition table for an active partition and continue
loading the Primary Boot Record (PBR) from the beginning of the
partition, if found.
.Pp
.Nm
is installed on the disk by
.Xr fdisk 8 ,
which is also used to operate the partition table.
.Pp
The partition table consists of four entries, only one of which may be
marked as
.Dq active .
The PBR is loaded from there.
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
A few messages are printed in case of errors:
.Bl -tag -width "no_active_partitionXX"
.It "No active partition"
Indicates that none of the partitions are marked
.Dq active .
.It Read error
An error occurred while fetching the primary boot loader.
.It "No O/S"
The partition table is empty.
