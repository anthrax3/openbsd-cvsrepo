@Retire hp300, mvme68k and mvme88k ports. These ports have no users, keeping
this hardware alive is becoming increasingly difficult, and I should heed the
message sent by the three disks which have died on me over the last few days.

Noone sane will mourn these ports anyway. So long, and thanks for the fish.

@Replace gazillions of badvaddr() or badwordaddr() calls with badaddr() calls.
With a few prototype declarations shuffling, this finally allows
<machine/locore.h> to die.

1.1
log
@Factorize db_interface code between luna88k and mvme88k, removing dead code
in the process; the arch-agnostic code keeps the ability for a specific
machine to define its own machine commands, such as "machine prom" for
mvme88k, in addition to the ``regular'' m88k machine commands.
