@1. It appears that trap() assumes instruction access or data access
   faults can only be caused by page faults. Could do better by
   checking PFSR in the CMMU and handling parity errors, page faults,
   segmentation faults and protection faults appropriately.

@Third try at importing the mvme88k port. This is a working kernel

Userland and compiler still need to be worked on.
Make certain what directory the import is done from.
