@Retire hp300, mvme68k and mvme88k ports. These ports have no users, keeping
this hardware alive is becoming increasingly difficult, and I should heed the
message sent by the three disks which have died on me over the last few days.

Noone sane will mourn these ports anyway. So long, and thanks for the fish.

@Split inittodr/resettodr code from actual tod routines, to allow for

log
@Get rid of the clock device attachment - since the clock is not something
we can live without, move it into the board-dependent code. This even makes
the code slightly smaller.

clock.c is moved from dev/ to mvme88k/ and only keeps common variables and
delay().
