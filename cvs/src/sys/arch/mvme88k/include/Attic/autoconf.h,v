@Retire hp300, mvme68k and mvme88k ports. These ports have no users, keeping
this hardware alive is becoming increasingly difficult, and I should heed the
message sent by the three disks which have died on me over the last few days.

Noone sane will mourn these ports anyway. So long, and thanks for the fish.

@Preliminary support for MVME180 and MVME181 boards. On-board serial ports
and VME controller are supported; tod chip isn't supported yet (coming soon).
MVME236 memory boards are not supported and won't likely be (unless I get my
hands on one).

MVME181-1 boots multiuser (slowly) with MVME328 SCSI and MVME376 Ethernet
despite only having 8MB of memory onboard.

MVME180 untested; might need tweaking to get MVME SCSI and Ethernet boards
supported.

Many thanks to Matti Nummi for lending me an MVME181 board.

log
@Preliminary switch to an mvme88k bus_space world. Not all drivers have been
converted yet, and they rely upon some linear mappings provided by bus_space.

In order to not impact performance, almost all the bus_space accesses go
through macros and inline functions. This currently restricts us to D16 and
D32 access modes, which are selected at compilation time. Since there are no
plans to support D8 vme devices in the future, this is acceptable for now.

This makes the "len" locator for vme devices go away, and allows to simplify
some code which was using the pcctwo device, and will now directly access
hardware which is known to exist, rather than wait until the device is
attached.

While there, try to enforce more interrupt vector number checks, since these
changes pointed out that dart(4) had been working correctly so far by sheer
luck only.

@Remove unused material from include files, as well as the annoying U() macro
which is only used to obfuscate things.

Doing this points out that the BUG memory is not at the same address on
187 and 197 (the 197 BUG is inside obio), so provide distinct constants,
and treat 187 and 197 slightly differently in pmap_bootstrap(). However, we
now need to map the 197 flash memory as well...

While there, simplify and constify pmap_table_build() and its associated data.

@This is a remove to get rid of the old mvme88k port which was incomplete
to replace it with a working version. The kernel compiles and works
at least.  The new version will be imported shortly.

@Third try at importing the mvme88k port. This is a working kernel
