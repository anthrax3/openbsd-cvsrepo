1.2
log
@Retire hp300, mvme68k and mvme88k ports. These ports have no users, keeping
this hardware alive is becoming increasingly difficult, and I should heed the
message sent by the three disks which have died on me over the last few days.

Noone sane will mourn these ports anyway. So long, and thanks for the fish.

@create new machine/_float.h which is namespace clean.  create a new
MI float.h which pulls in and defines the values that are needed from
there, and repair sys/limits.h so that it defines the values it needs
as well (depending on POSIX version, XPG version, etc).  guenther has
a more exact selection of that coming for limits.h.
this also fixes a few mistakes for the vax.
