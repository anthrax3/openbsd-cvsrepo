@Retire hp300, mvme68k and mvme88k ports. These ports have no users, keeping
this hardware alive is becoming increasingly difficult, and I should heed the
message sent by the three disks which have died on me over the last few days.

Noone sane will mourn these ports anyway. So long, and thanks for the fish.

@Preliminary support for MVME180 and MVME181 boards. On-board serial ports
and VME controller are supported; tod chip isn't supported yet (coming soon).
MVME236 memory boards are not supported and won't likely be (unless I get my
hands on one).

MVME181-1 boots multiuser (slowly) with MVME328 SCSI and MVME376 Ethernet
despite only having 8MB of memory onboard.

MVME180 untested; might need tweaking to get MVME SCSI and Ethernet boards
supported.

Many thanks to Matti Nummi for lending me an MVME181 board.
