@Retire hp300, mvme68k and mvme88k ports. These ports have no users, keeping
this hardware alive is becoming increasingly difficult, and I should heed the
message sent by the three disks which have died on me over the last few days.

Noone sane will mourn these ports anyway. So long, and thanks for the fish.

@Replace the bunch of md_* function pointers with a `struct board' containing
function pointers for all the board-specific code.

Add a bunch of `struct board' methods to cover most, if not all, of the
`per-board' logic. This allows most of the md drivers to be cleaned up and
no longer need to embed board-specific knowledge.

@Rework the PFSR register analysis code on mvme88k: split it into four
independent subfunctions, turn PFSR_SAVE into a couple of NOP, and replace
them early at runtime with a branch to the selected routine, which will
return to pfsr_save.
This is really better for 188 systems.

log
@Remove unused material from include files, as well as the annoying U() macro
which is only used to obfuscate things.

Doing this points out that the BUG memory is not at the same address on
187 and 197 (the 197 BUG is inside obio), so provide distinct constants,
and treat 187 and 197 slightly differently in pmap_bootstrap(). However, we
now need to map the 197 flash memory as well...

While there, simplify and constify pmap_table_build() and its associated data.
