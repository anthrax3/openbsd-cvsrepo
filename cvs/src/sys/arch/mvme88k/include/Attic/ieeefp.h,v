log
@Retire hp300, mvme68k and mvme88k ports. These ports have no users, keeping
this hardware alive is becoming increasingly difficult, and I should heed the
message sent by the three disks which have died on me over the last few days.

Noone sane will mourn these ports anyway. So long, and thanks for the fish.

There are more occurences hiding in binutils, lynx and afs but I am too
lazy to report them upstream at the moment.

@Third try at importing the mvme88k port. This is a working kernel
