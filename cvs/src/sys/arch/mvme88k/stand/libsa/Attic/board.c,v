@Retire hp300, mvme68k and mvme88k ports. These ports have no users, keeping
this hardware alive is becoming increasingly difficult, and I should heed the
message sent by the three disks which have died on me over the last few days.

Noone sane will mourn these ports anyway. So long, and thanks for the fish.

log
@Perform the mvme197 latency timer reprogramming in the boot blocks, in
addition to the kernel, and unconditionnaly handle all busswitch revision 1
based boards as horribly broken, even with 50MHz clocks.

Based on an report of an early 50MHz 197LE board being unable to boot,
due to memory corruption.
