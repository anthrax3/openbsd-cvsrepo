@Retire hp300, mvme68k and mvme88k ports. These ports have no users, keeping
this hardware alive is becoming increasingly difficult, and I should heed the
message sent by the three disks which have died on me over the last few days.

Noone sane will mourn these ports anyway. So long, and thanks for the fish.

@Rewrite the startup code for the mvme88k bootblocks, once again. Some of
them (especially the netboot ones) will now self-relocate, which makes
BUG configuration much simpler.

WARNING: for disk-based systems, you need to update bootxx and bootsd at the
same time. New bootsd will not run when loaded from an older bootxx.
This doesn't matter much since you need both with installboot.
