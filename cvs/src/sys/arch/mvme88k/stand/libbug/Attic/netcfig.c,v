1.3
log
@Retire hp300, mvme68k and mvme88k ports. These ports have no users, keeping
this hardware alive is becoming increasingly difficult, and I should heed the
message sent by the three disks which have died on me over the last few days.

Noone sane will mourn these ports anyway. So long, and thanks for the fish.

@Recognize a wrong network configuration which would cause tftpboot to
apparently freeze, and in any case fail to load anything; if this happens,
tell the user what to do and return to the BUG (altering the configuration
from tftpboot itself doesn't seem to have any effect, unfortunately).
