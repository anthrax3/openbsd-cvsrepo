1.3
log
@Retire hp300, mvme68k and mvme88k ports. These ports have no users, keeping
this hardware alive is becoming increasingly difficult, and I should heed the
message sent by the three disks which have died on me over the last few days.

Noone sane will mourn these ports anyway. So long, and thanks for the fish.

log
@Change daddr_t to daddr32_t.  The bootblocks on our architectures only
do 32-bit block spanning.  If later on we get some that can/should do
64-bit, that can be done now using daddr64_t (but of course, we are taking
this step to finalize the daddr_t 64-bit conversion).

1.1
log
@tftp-only netboot code, inspired from mvmeppc, and stripped down; it will
become necessary to boot from unsupported (as far as mvme88k/stand/ is
concerned) network cards, such as the MVME374 and the MVME376.

Not enabled in the build yet, because there are a few issues left, but
it is nonetheless usable...
