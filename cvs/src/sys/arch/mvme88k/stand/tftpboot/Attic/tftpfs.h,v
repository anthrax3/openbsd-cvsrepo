log
@Retire hp300, mvme68k and mvme88k ports. These ports have no users, keeping
this hardware alive is becoming increasingly difficult, and I should heed the
message sent by the three disks which have died on me over the last few days.

Noone sane will mourn these ports anyway. So long, and thanks for the fish.

1.1
log
@tftp-only netboot code, inspired from mvmeppc, and stripped down; it will
become necessary to boot from unsupported (as far as mvme88k/stand/ is
concerned) network cards, such as the MVME374 and the MVME376.

Not enabled in the build yet, because there are a few issues left, but
it is nonetheless usable...
