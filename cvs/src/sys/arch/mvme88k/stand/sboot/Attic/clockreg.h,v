@S-Records boot code for mvme88k, finally. Allows a kernel to be loaded from
network, using either the on-board interface (on MVME187 and MVME197) or
any MVME376.

While there, add MVME376 support to netboot.

@Third try at importing the mvme88k port. This is a working kernel
from nivas.
Userland and compiler still need to be worked on.
Make certain what directory the import is done from.
