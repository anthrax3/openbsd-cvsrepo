1.2
log
@Retire hp300, mvme68k and mvme88k ports. These ports have no users, keeping
this hardware alive is becoming increasingly difficult, and I should heed the
message sent by the three disks which have died on me over the last few days.

Noone sane will mourn these ports anyway. So long, and thanks for the fish.

1.1
log
@S-Records boot code for mvme88k, finally. Allows a kernel to be loaded from
network, using either the on-board interface (on MVME187 and MVME197) or
any MVME376.

While there, add MVME376 support to netboot.
