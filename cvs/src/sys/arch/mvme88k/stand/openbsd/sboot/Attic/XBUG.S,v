 * Theo sez: I wrote a bootrom for the MVME147 *years* ago. To write
 * this ROM I copied a few chunks from the old bootrom, like this piece:
 * 
 * "watch this, the moto bastard struck here, shouldn't have hired people
 * from intel I tried to tell them...
 *       "BOOT"
 *       offset from baseaddr to entry point.
 *       offset from baseaddr to first word after checksum
 *       garbage
 *       checksum made with CS command
 * No need to change any of this unless you try to take our names out
 * of there. Ie. don't touch."

@Third try at importing the mvme88k port. This is a working kernel
from nivas.
Userland and compiler still need to be worked on.
Make certain what directory the import is done from.
