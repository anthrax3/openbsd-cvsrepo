@Retire hp300, mvme68k and mvme88k ports. These ports have no users, keeping
this hardware alive is becoming increasingly difficult, and I should heed the
message sent by the three disks which have died on me over the last few days.

Noone sane will mourn these ports anyway. So long, and thanks for the fish.

@Unbreak tape boot blocks by not attempting to load kernel symbols, and providing
a smarter seek routine which can seek forward and cope with the libsa gzip code
reading the first 4KB of a file upon open, only to discard the buffer because
it assumes we can always seek backwards.

These boot blocks had been broken since the switch to the MI libsa loadfile
code.

Reported for mvme88k by Michael Fritsch, thanks and sorry for taking too long
to fix.
