@Retire hp300, mvme68k and mvme88k ports. These ports have no users, keeping
this hardware alive is becoming increasingly difficult, and I should heed the
message sent by the three disks which have died on me over the last few days.

Noone sane will mourn these ports anyway. So long, and thanks for the fish.

@Preliminary switch to an mvme88k bus_space world. Not all drivers have been
converted yet, and they rely upon some linear mappings provided by bus_space.

In order to not impact performance, almost all the bus_space accesses go
through macros and inline functions. This currently restricts us to D16 and
D32 access modes, which are selected at compilation time. Since there are no
plans to support D8 vme devices in the future, this is acceptable for now.

This makes the "len" locator for vme devices go away, and allows to simplify
some code which was using the pcctwo device, and will now directly access
hardware which is known to exist, rather than wait until the device is
attached.

While there, try to enforce more interrupt vector number checks, since these
changes pointed out that dart(4) had been working correctly so far by sheer
luck only.
