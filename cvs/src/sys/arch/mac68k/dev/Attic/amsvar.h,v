@Factorize akbd and ams drivers between mac68k and macppc; while there, start
moving out common adb code as well, and merge adb_direct.c into adb.c to
simplify external header files.

No functional change; more cleanups to come.

1.1
log
@Import NetBSD's direct adb code on mac68k, switching to real keyboard and mouse
drivers, and to wscons as the console; a few parts borrowed from OpenBSD/macppc
as well.

Currently only working with displays configured in 1bpp or 8bpp modes; this
limitation will be worked on ASAP.

Tested by claudio@@ kettenis@@ martin@@ nick@@ and I on various models. X11 changes
coming soon.
