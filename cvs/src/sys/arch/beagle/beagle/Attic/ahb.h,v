@Reduce autoconf(4) overuse on beagle

Renamed `ahb' to `omap' and extended it to configure the on-chip
devices directly, based a board-specific table instead of trying to
maintain addresses, interrupt numbers and such for two OMAP variants
in the same config file.

This may be an intermediate step, but should provide us some relief
already. :)

Suggestions from deraadt and drahn; ok drahn@@

@Add gumstix overo support. It's very similar to be beagleboard at this
point. So add it's card id and handle it like the beagleboard.

@Pile of diffs to improve beagle/panda status. fetching u-boot parameters

Devices now detect device_id from u-boot and decide to enable/disable

@Initial effort on a port to the omap35xx platform specifically beagleboard,
however other omap system may be supportable. Not functional until armv7
