@In the future, we shouldn't have one port port ARM SoC, that's just
ridiculous.  This is the first step for a common and generic ARM port
for ARMv7 SoCs.

@Reduce autoconf(4) overuse on beagle

Renamed `ahb' to `omap' and extended it to configure the on-chip
devices directly, based a board-specific table instead of trying to
maintain addresses, interrupt numbers and such for two OMAP variants
in the same config file.

This may be an intermediate step, but should provide us some relief
already. :)
