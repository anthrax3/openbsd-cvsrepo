@In the future, we shouldn't have one port port ARM SoC, that's just
ridiculous.  This is the first step for a common and generic ARM port
for ARMv7 SoCs.

@refactor sys/param.h and machine/param.h.  A lot of #ifdef _KERNEL is added

build.  Checked on 90% of platforms...

@Initial effort on a port to the omap35xx platform specifically beagleboard,
