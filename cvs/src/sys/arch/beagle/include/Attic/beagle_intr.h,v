@In the future, we shouldn't have one port port ARM SoC, that's just
ridiculous.  This is the first step for a common and generic ARM port
for ARMv7 SoCs.

@Initial effort on a port to the omap35xx platform specifically beagleboard,
however other omap system may be supportable. Not functional until armv7
