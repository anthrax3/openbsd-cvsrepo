@Remove OpenBSD/pegaos, this has been announced before but delayed until
the tree was stable. No point in code supporting a company which screws
its employees being in the OpenBSD tree.

 * This module implements a "raw device" interface suitable for
 * use by the stand-alone I/O library NFS code.  This interface
 * does not support any "block" access, and exists only for the
 * purpose of initializing the network interface, getting boot
 * parameters, and performing the NFS mount.
 *
 * At open time, this does:
 *
 * find interface	- netif_open()
 * BOOTP		- bootp()
 * RPC/mountd		- nfs_mount()
 *
 * The root file handle from mountd is saved in a global
 * for use by the NFS open code (NFS/lookup).
 *
 * Note: this is based in part on sys/arch/sparc/stand/net.c
