@armish handled some early-gen arm machines, which required tons of
workarounds.  Some of them will soon stand in the way of armv7.
Off to the attic you go.

@refactor sys/param.h and machine/param.h.  A lot of #ifdef _KERNEL is added
to keep definitions our of user space.  The MD files now follow a consistant

independently.  locore, bootblocks, and libkvm still see enough visibility to
build.  Checked on 90% of platforms...
