@armish handled some early-gen arm machines, which required tons of
workarounds.  Some of them will soon stand in the way of armv7.
Off to the attic you go.

@"It's not the years, honey; it's the mileage."

bluetooth support doesn't work and isn't going anywhere. the current
design is a dead end, and should not be the basis for any future support.
general consensus says to whack it so as to not mislead the unwary.
