@armish handled some early-gen arm machines, which required tons of
workarounds.  Some of them will soon stand in the way of armv7.
Off to the attic you go.

@First pass at removing clauses 3 and 4 from NetBSD licenses.

Not sure what's more surprising: how long it took for NetBSD to
catch up to the rest of the BSDs (including UCB), or the amount of
code that NetBSD has claimed for itself without attributing to the
actual authors.

@ework armish bootloader into an interactive one, much like i386 has.
Make sure disk names match those used by the kernel.  This means that now
it boots from wd0 by default, whatever slot it is in.

1.1
log
@First stab at an armish bootloader.  It will load /bsd from the drive in the
upper slot of the Thecus n2100.  Glued together from bits from the NetBSD
cobalt and evbarm ports.
