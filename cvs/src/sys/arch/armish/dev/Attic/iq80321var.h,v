@armish handled some early-gen arm machines, which required tons of
workarounds.  Some of them will soon stand in the way of armv7.
Off to the attic you go.

log
@Preserve ATU translations instead of forcing the values to something.
Detect device type using some simple checks and use table driven
interrupt maps for known devices.
IO space appears to not want to be at 0, but at some bus offset (0x90000000)
so skew mappings into this io bus base.
Thecus N2100 and I/O Data Landisk (HDL-G) are now partially working.

@Add a new port for ARM based products from a variety of vendors, typically
using Redboot as a loader and using pci, that have a variety of fairly minor
hardware differences between them.
