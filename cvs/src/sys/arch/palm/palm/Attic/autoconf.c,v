@Late spring cleaning of the arm code for old dusty bits we do not want to
keep:
- remove bootconfig parameter passing feature (unused).
- unifdef __PROG32 and remove all remains of arm26 code.
- remove ARMFPE support (unused).
- remove support for ARM2, ARM2AS, ARM3, ARM6, ARM7, ARM7TDMI and StrongARM
  processor families, and the related silicon bug workarounds (especially
  the SA-110 STM^ bug).
- remove cpu_functions no longer necessary after previous removals.
- remove ARM32_DISABLE_ALIGNMENT_FAULTS option (unused).
- make FIQ support conditional on option FIQ (unused, but may be eventually).

Discussed with drahn@@ and jasper@@ long ago, I was sitting on this commit for
no good reason.

@Get rid of machdep.debug, machdep.booted_device and machdep.booted_kernel
sysctl. Only the first one is really implemented, and it only matters on
older processor flavours we don't run on (and don't want to), so this was
just dead weight.
