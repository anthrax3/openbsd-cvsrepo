@The "powerpc" port which has supported the newer Apple Macintosh powerpc based
is being renamed to macppc. This is to allow sharing of common code
between different powerpc base platforms.

Most of the work involved in the renaming process was performed by miod@@

Files moved from arch/powerpc to arch/macppc.

This port is partly based on the NetBSD powerpc port by Wolfgang Solfrank.
The NetBSD code was imported by Dale Rahn who also added support for ELF.

A lot of code has been removed and a lot of new code has been added to
create a monolithic kernel that uses OpenFirmware or any other boot plattform
as little possible.

The current shape of the PowerPC port is a result of a work performed by
Per Fogelstrom, Opsycon AB. The work was sponsored by RTMX Inc, North
Carolina, USA.

The current kernel supports MCG Powerstack family of machines DT-604, MT-604,
Series E, Powerstack Pro[234]000 and V.I Power.4e PowerPC 604 based VME board.
More will come in the future. Openfirmware is required for all systems.
Powerstack family machines with 603 processor will only work with certain
versions of openfirmware, not the latest versions however, older versions.
a11 5
Support for Openfirmware drivers was reintroduced, in a manner which
is compatible with "real" drivers.
If done carefully OF drivers and hardware drivers can be mixed, if
however a hardware driver is configured, then OF tries to access the 
device, it can hang the system.

@Major changes here and there, tweaks elsewhere.
Support for Openfirmware drivers was reintroduced so that more systems
were supported. This should work with the real driver configurations
as well.

Bootloader files were deleted/replaced with the newer versions in the
subdirectory. Some effort has been made to be closer to support booting
(at least the bootloader) on the Mac.

Config files that end with OFW are the openfirmware versions of the kernels
without have native drivers.

Native driver support has not been changed, presumably it still works.
I couldn't test that.

should be compatible with "real" drivers. It is yet to be seen if
a kernel can have both OF drivers and real drivers. But at least
both versions can be built.

Other notes:
	libexec/ftpd (ftpd.o) does not compile with optimization.
	`cc: Internal compiler error: program cc1 got fatal signal 11'
	Real cause unknown. will compile and work correctly
	if compiled without -O.
	(worked around with a makefile change)

	This probably has changed with the introduction of gcc 2.8.X.X
	but not completely verified (yet).

Until this README file states that the port is ready, it is unlikey
that the port will build correctly.

Currently, dont even try, go ahead and look at the code, but
nothing has been tried since It was checked in.

I hope to have this ready before Jan 1997
