@The ISA based systems are not currently supported. When or If they are
supported in the future, some of this code can be revived, or rewritten
as appropriate. But since it not maintained and will likely not compile,
there is little reason to keep it around for now.

@add wscons support to powerpc port.
This contains several pieces of the port
MI:
    vgafb, on powerpc under openfirmware the vga card comes up in gfx mode.
    instead of resetting it to text mode, vgafb treats this as a raster
    display. The mechanism used may not have been the best, it's
    interface to wscons is as a text display, and it does the character
    plotting itself.
    font_8x16.c was stolen from the atari port for use.

MD:
    ppcppi support stolen from alpha
    pms.c, pckbd.c and the rest of the support files were
    used nearly directly.

    powerpc
      conf.c to support wscon, vga/kbd
      machdep.c hack to get around a bus_space_set_region,bus_space_copy error.
      ofw_machdep.c some hack code on the road to supporting wscons as console.

log
@Continue the aborted merge of current just before 2.9 was cut into the
SMP branch.  Note that this will not make any progress of SMP functionality,
it is just merging of new code from the trunk into the old branch.
Please do not ask me questions about SMP status because of this mail,
instead go read the archives of smp@@openbsd.org, where I mailed about
these commits some week ago.  Another note: I am doing this in chunks now,
so as to not lock too much of the tree for long times
