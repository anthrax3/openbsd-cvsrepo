@The ISA based systems are not currently supported. When or If they are
supported in the future, some of this code can be revived, or rewritten
as appropriate. But since it not maintained and will likely not compile,
there is little reason to keep it around for now.

log
@Continue the aborted merge of current just before 2.9 was cut into the
SMP branch.  Note that this will not make any progress of SMP functionality,
it is just merging of new code from the trunk into the old branch.
Please do not ask me questions about SMP status because of this mail,
instead go read the archives of smp@@openbsd.org, where I mailed about
these commits some week ago.  Another note: I am doing this in chunks now,
so as to not lock too much of the tree for long times

@Changes to probe for address, and frequency for serial console.
This should enable the same kernel to work on VI machines as
well as MCG machines. Only remaining piece is the rtc.

For now an extra config file has been added to use serial for MCG
machines until all issues are resolved.  The various extra config
files and ramdisks should go away as soon as merger is finished.

@Put this back for now, appearently the VI boards use COM4 for console.
they only have COM3 and COM4, MCG boards have COM1 and COM2 addresses (only).
This will need to be turned into a variable that is probed and
then passed to the console (com) driver.

@Various changes to allow mixing of ofw drivers and real drivers.
NCR driver seems to work.
Major changes are isa can be child of pci or mainbus.
ofroot is child of mainbus not root.
ofw bus configured before pci bus
Note that if a pci device configures accessing of driver will crash
the system. they need to be exclusive.
