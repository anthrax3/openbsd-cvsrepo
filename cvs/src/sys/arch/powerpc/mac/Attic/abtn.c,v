@The "powerpc" port which has supported the newer Apple Macintosh powerpc based
is being renamed to macppc. This is to allow sharing of common code
between different powerpc base platforms.

Most of the work involved in the renaming process was performed by miod@@

Files moved from powerpc/mac to macppc/dev

@Continue the aborted merge of current just before 2.9 was cut into the
SMP branch.  Note that this will not make any progress of SMP functionality,
it is just merging of new code from the trunk into the old branch.
Please do not ask me questions about SMP status because of this mail,
instead go read the archives of smp@@openbsd.org, where I mailed about
these commits some week ago.  Another note: I am doing this in chunks now,
so as to not lock too much of the tree for long times
