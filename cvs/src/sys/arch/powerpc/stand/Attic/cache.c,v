@The "powerpc" port which has supported the newer Apple Macintosh powerpc based
is being renamed to macppc. This is to allow sharing of common code
between different powerpc base platforms.

Most of the work involved in the renaming process was performed by miod@@

Files moved from powerpc/stand to macppc/stand

@Add OpenBSD tags.
changes to boot on Apple iMac G3 (333). ethernet address changes
Locore.c
	OpenBSD tag
	hack to delay decrementer exception until after bootload,
	apple OFW enables interrupts during "system calls"
	add OF_call_method, to make ofw call by name.
	Apple OFW can return unexpected values from getchar calls.
alloc.c
	OpenBSD tag
boot.c
	OpenBSD tag
	updated (but still unused load symbol code).
	Code cleanup for egcs.
cache.c
	OpenBSD tag
	use dcbst, not dcbf
	icbi has both arguments as registers, not constant and register.
net.c
	OpenBSD tag
netif_of.c
	OpenBSD tag
	add "local-mac-address" to methods of fetching mac address,
	it can be stored in that variable or in mac-address.
	support dma buffers,
	add additional return value for OF_read for network timeout purposes.
ofdev.c
	OpenBSD tag
	support dma buffers,
ofdev.h
	OpenBSD tag
	add dmabuf
	remove MAC default kernel def.
ofwmagic.S

1.1
log
@Major changes here and there, tweaks elsewhere.
Support for Openfirmware drivers was reintroduced so that more systems
were supported. This should work with the real driver configurations
as well.

Bootloader files were deleted/replaced with the newer versions in the
subdirectory. Some effort has been made to be closer to support booting
(at least the bootloader) on the Mac.

Config files that end with OFW are the openfirmware versions of the kernels
without have native drivers.

Native driver support has not been changed, presumably it still works.
I couldn't test that.
