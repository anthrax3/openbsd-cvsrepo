@The "powerpc" port which has supported the newer Apple Macintosh powerpc based
is being renamed to macppc. This is to allow sharing of common code
between different powerpc base platforms.

Most of the work involved in the renaming process was performed by miod@@

Files moved from powerpc/stand to macppc/stand

	use dcbst, not dcbf
	icbi has both arguments as registers, not constant and register.
net.c
	OpenBSD tag
netif_of.c
	OpenBSD tag
	add "local-mac-address" to methods of fetching mac address,
	it can be stored in that variable or in mac-address.
	support dma buffers,
	add additional return value for OF_read for network timeout purposes.
ofdev.c

@Major changes here and there, tweaks elsewhere.
Support for Openfirmware drivers was reintroduced so that more systems
were supported. This should work with the real driver configurations
as well.

Bootloader files were deleted/replaced with the newer versions in the
subdirectory. Some effort has been made to be closer to support booting
(at least the bootloader) on the Mac.

Config files that end with OFW are the openfirmware versions of the kernels
without have native drivers.

Native driver support has not been changed, presumably it still works.
I couldn't test that.

@Check-in of powerpc kernel support.
NOTE: This will not work until the other pieces are checked in.
This is primarily the NetBSD powerpc port, with modifications
to support ELF.
