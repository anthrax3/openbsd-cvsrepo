log
@The "powerpc" port which has supported the newer Apple Macintosh powerpc based
is being renamed to macppc. This is to allow sharing of common code
between different powerpc base platforms.

Most of the work involved in the renaming process was performed by miod@@

Files moved from powerpc/stand/ofwboot to macppc/stand/ofwboot

@Add support for loading the bootloader and kernel from an HFS filesystem,
using firmware. Mostly from NetBSD. This allows kernels to be booted directly
from an HFS hard drive.

1.3
log
@Major changes here and there, tweaks elsewhere.
Support for Openfirmware drivers was reintroduced so that more systems
were supported. This should work with the real driver configurations
as well.

Bootloader files were deleted/replaced with the newer versions in the
subdirectory. Some effort has been made to be closer to support booting
(at least the bootloader) on the Mac.

Config files that end with OFW are the openfirmware versions of the kernels
without have native drivers.

Native driver support has not been changed, presumably it still works.
I couldn't test that.

1.3.8.1
log
@Continue the aborted merge of current just before 2.9 was cut into the
SMP branch.  Note that this will not make any progress of SMP functionality,
it is just merging of new code from the trunk into the old branch.
Please do not ask me questions about SMP status because of this mail,
instead go read the archives of smp@@openbsd.org, where I mailed about
these commits some week ago.  Another note: I am doing this in chunks now,
so as to not lock too much of the tree for long times
