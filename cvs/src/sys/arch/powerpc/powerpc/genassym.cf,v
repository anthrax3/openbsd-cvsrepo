1.3
log
@The "powerpc" port which has supported the newer Apple Macintosh powerpc based
is being renamed to macppc. This is to allow sharing of common code
between different powerpc base platforms.

Most of the work involved in the renaming process was performed by miod@@

Files moved from powerpc/powerpc to macppc/macppc

This moves hardware specific files from the common directory to the
platform specific directory. This leaves common files.
With this change all of the debugger (db_) files have been moved to
the platform specific directory. The debugger should be reconsidered
and commonized.

@Monolithic (No OpenFirmware driver crap...) PowerPC kernel. This is the
first release based on Wolfgang Solfrank, TooLs GmbH, work. Most OFW stuff
has been ripped out. Only a few functions for memory probing and halt/reboot
functionality has been kept. The kernel currently works with V.I's power.4e
PowerPC604 board, but more will come.
