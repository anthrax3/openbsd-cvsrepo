@Monolithic (No OpenFirmware driver crap...) PowerPC kernel. This is the
first release based on Wolfgang Solfrank, TooLs GmbH, work. Most OFW stuff
has been ripped out. Only a few functions for memory probing and halt/reboot
functionality has been kept. The kernel currently works with V.I's power.4e
PowerPC604 board, but more will come.

@Merge in -current from two days ago in the SMP branch.
As usual with merges, they do not indicate progress, so do not hold
your breath for working SMP, and do not mail me and ask about the
state of it.  It has not changed.  There is work ongoing, but very, very
slowly.  The commit is done in parts as to not lock up the tree in too
big chunks at a time.
