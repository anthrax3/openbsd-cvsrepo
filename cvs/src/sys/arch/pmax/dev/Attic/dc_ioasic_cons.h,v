1.2
log
@Late in the release of OpenBSD/pmax 2.7 a conflict between the pmax
dc driver and the generic if_dc driver was found. The fix was to
change the pmax drivers name to dz instead. But this was only done
in a miminal way.

This commit will remove the old dc driver.

@update the pmax stuff to NetBSD 961107 - this version i got somehow
compiled on my decstation 2100 (PLUTO) - but it will not fully work
out of the box - but i want to bring it into the tree because i get
my own pmax on 961228 - so that i have a good startpoint then :-)

all the OpenBSD changes to the pmax tree will follow in the next commit

@Update the SMP branch to -current, this breaks the SMP branch though.
But it will be fixed soonish.  Note, nothing new has happened, this is just
a merge of the trunk into this branch.
