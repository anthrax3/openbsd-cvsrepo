1.1
log
@Late in the release of OpenBSD/pmax 2.7 a conflict between the pmax
dc driver and the generic if_dc driver was found. The fix was to
change the pmax drivers name to dz instead. But this was only done
in a miminal way.

This commit will add a new dz driver to replace the current dc.

1.1.4.1
log
@Update the SMP branch to -current, this breaks the SMP branch though.
But it will be fixed soonish.  Note, nothing new has happened, this is just
a merge of the trunk into this branch.

1.1.4.2
log
@Merge in -current from two days ago in the SMP branch.
As usual with merges, they do not indicate progress, so do not hold
your breath for working SMP, and do not mail me and ask about the
state of it.  It has not changed.  There is work ongoing, but very, very
slowly.  The commit is done in parts as to not lock up the tree in too
big chunks at a time.
