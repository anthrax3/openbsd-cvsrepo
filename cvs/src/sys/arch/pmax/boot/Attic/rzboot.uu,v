@import the pmax bootblocks uuencoded until someone fixes the boot
code to compile (it never compiled in OpenBSD and i aslo couldn't
find the sources NetBSD/pmax builds it's bootblocks from)

pmax bootblocks should be rewritten anyway to be able to load elf
kernels etc.

@Merge in -current from two days ago in the SMP branch.
As usual with merges, they do not indicate progress, so do not hold
your breath for working SMP, and do not mail me and ask about the
state of it.  It has not changed.  There is work ongoing, but very, very
slowly.  The commit is done in parts as to not lock up the tree in too
big chunks at a time.
