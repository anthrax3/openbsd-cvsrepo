@update the pmax specific stuff to NetBSD-current as of about 970608 - some
cosmetic things will follow together with an update to an exact NETBSD_CU-

@Merge in -current from two days ago in the SMP branch.
As usual with merges, they do not indicate progress, so do not hold
your breath for working SMP, and do not mail me and ask about the
state of it.  It has not changed.  There is work ongoing, but very, very
slowly.  The commit is done in parts as to not lock up the tree in too
big chunks at a time.
