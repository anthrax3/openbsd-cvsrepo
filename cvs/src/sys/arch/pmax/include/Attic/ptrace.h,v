@Merge in -current from two days ago in the SMP branch.
As usual with merges, they do not indicate progress, so do not hold
your breath for working SMP, and do not mail me and ask about the
state of it.  It has not changed.  There is work ongoing, but very, very
slowly.  The commit is done in parts as to not lock up the tree in too
big chunks at a time.

@from netbsd:
Add support for ptrace PT_GETREGS and PT_SETREGS for NetBSD/pmax:
 * define PT_GETREGS and PT_SETREGS in pmax/include/ptrace.h
 * Flesh out the stubs in pmax/pmax/process_machdep.c to handle
   those requests.
 * Now that "struct reg" is actually used, remove the bogus
   #ifdef LANGUAGE_C around its definition, and redo pmax/include/reg.h
   so that the definitions needed by locore.S are in a separate file,
   pmax/include/regnum.h.
 * update locore.S to match.
