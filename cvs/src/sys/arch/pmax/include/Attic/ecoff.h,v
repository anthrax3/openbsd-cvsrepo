@Update the SMP branch to -current, this breaks the SMP branch though.
But it will be fixed soonish.  Note, nothing new has happened, this is just
a merge of the trunk into this branch.

@update the pmax stuff to NetBSD 961107 - this version i got somehow
compiled on my decstation 2100 (PLUTO) - but it will not fully work
out of the box - but i want to bring it into the tree because i get
my own pmax on 961228 - so that i have a good startpoint then :-)

all the OpenBSD changes to the pmax tree will follow in the next commit
