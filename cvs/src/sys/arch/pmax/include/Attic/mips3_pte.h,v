@update the pmax stuff to NetBSD 961107 - this version i got somehow
compiled on my decstation 2100 (PLUTO) - but it will not fully work
out of the box - but i want to bring it into the tree because i get
my own pmax on 961228 - so that i have a good startpoint then :-)

all the OpenBSD changes to the pmax tree will follow in the next commit

@Merge in -current from two days ago in the SMP branch.
As usual with merges, they do not indicate progress, so do not hold
your breath for working SMP, and do not mail me and ask about the
state of it.  It has not changed.  There is work ongoing, but very, very
slowly.  The commit is done in parts as to not lock up the tree in too
big chunks at a time.
