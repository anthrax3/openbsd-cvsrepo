@We need to loose some weight.
If someone feels very opposed to this, the code is left in the Attic.
Just revive and _make_it_work_.

@Continue the aborted merge of current just before 2.9 was cut into the
SMP branch.  Note that this will not make any progress of SMP functionality,
it is just merging of new code from the trunk into the old branch.
Please do not ask me questions about SMP status because of this mail,
instead go read the archives of smp@@openbsd.org, where I mailed about
these commits some week ago.  Another note: I am doing this in chunks now,
so as to not lock too much of the tree for long times
