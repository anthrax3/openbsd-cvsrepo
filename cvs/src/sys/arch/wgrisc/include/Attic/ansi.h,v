@We need to loose some weight.
If someone feels very opposed to this, the code is left in the Attic.

 * lose a bit of ANSI conformance, but your programs will still work.

@Use an _BSD_FOO_T_ type declaration for off_t in machine/ansi.h to allow
off_t to be visible in stdio.h even in strict ansi mode.  This is needed
for ftello()/fseeko() and it allows us to remove the horrible fpos_t hack.

log
@Continue the aborted merge of current just before 2.9 was cut into the
SMP branch.  Note that this will not make any progress of SMP functionality,
it is just merging of new code from the trunk into the old branch.
Please do not ask me questions about SMP status because of this mail,
instead go read the archives of smp@@openbsd.org, where I mailed about
these commits some week ago.  Another note: I am doing this in chunks now,
so as to not lock too much of the tree for long times
