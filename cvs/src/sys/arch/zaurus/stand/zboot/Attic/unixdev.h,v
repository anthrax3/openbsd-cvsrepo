@Retire zaurus, as it hasn't made the EABI jump and will be permanently broken

@Change daddr_t to daddr32_t.  The bootblocks on our architectures only
do 32-bit block spanning.  If later on we get some that can/should do
64-bit, that can be done now using daddr64_t (but of course, we are taking
this step to finalize the daddr_t 64-bit conversion).
