@VM_MAX_KERNEL_ADDRESS is the end of the kva range not the end of
addressable virtual memory space but arm ports were using a value of
0xffffffff for this.

Instead of using a shared VM_MAX_KERNEL_ADDRESS define add md
VM_KERNEL_SPACE_SIZE defines based on the KERNEL_VM_SIZE values
from the respective machdep.c files.

djm's novena was hitting "panic: bufinit: can't reserve VM for buffers"
without a similiar change.

@Remove the freelist member from vm_physseg

The new world order of pmemrange makes this data completely redundant
(being dealt with by the pmemrange constraints instead). Remove all code
that messes with the freelist.

While touching every caller of uvm_page_physload() anyway, add the flags
argument to all callers (all but one is 0 and that one already used
PHYSLOAD_DEVICE) and remove the macro magic to allow callers to continue
without it.

Should shrink the code a bit, as well.

matthew@@ pointed out some mistakes i'd made.
