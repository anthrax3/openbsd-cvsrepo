1.2
log
@Late spring cleaning of the arm code for old dusty bits we do not want to
keep:
- remove bootconfig parameter passing feature (unused).
- unifdef __PROG32 and remove all remains of arm26 code.
- remove ARMFPE support (unused).
- remove support for ARM2, ARM2AS, ARM3, ARM6, ARM7, ARM7TDMI and StrongARM
  processor families, and the related silicon bug workarounds (especially
  the SA-110 STM^ bug).
- remove cpu_functions no longer necessary after previous removals.
- remove ARM32_DISABLE_ALIGNMENT_FAULTS option (unused).
- make FIQ support conditional on option FIQ (unused, but may be eventually).

Discussed with drahn@@ and jasper@@ long ago, I was sitting on this commit for
no good reason.
