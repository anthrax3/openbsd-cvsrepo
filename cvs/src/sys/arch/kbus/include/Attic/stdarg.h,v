@We need to loose some weight.
If someone feels very opposed to this, the code is left in the Attic.
Just revive and _make_it_work_.

 * Gcc-2.x tries to use ldd/std for double and quad_t values, but Sun's

 * 8 byte integers in %o0+%o1 and the same 8 bytes as a double in %f0+%f1.)

@Update the SMP branch to -current, this breaks the SMP branch though.
But it will be fixed soonish.  Note, nothing new has happened, this is just
a merge of the trunk into this branch.
