@Only attempt to load /etc/random.seed from the boot device after the kernel
image has been succesfully loaded (with the recent loadfile changes allowing
us to know where the randomness needs to be loaded). While there, don't
bother doing this when booting from tape.

This works around the sun4e PROM 1.6, which gets confused by PROM open() -
close() sequences without any I/O happening in between.

Crank boot blocks version to 2.11.

1.11
log
@When running on a sun4d or sun4m system, have the bootblocks ask for one
more megabyte of virtual memory beyond the kernel image; this is safe to do
as you can't find any such system with less than 8MB of contiguous memory.

While nothing in the kernel has a need for that extra memory to be available
to the kernel for its bootstrap needs, forthcoming changes (post-5.7) will
need it, and these kernels won't work when booted from boot loaders prior to
this change. By shipping 5.7 with updated boot blocks, we'll make upgrading
to 5.7-CURRENT easier for sun4m owners, when the time comes.

Crank boot blocks version.

1.5
log
@In the boot blocks, stop assuming we have a 1:1 mapping of low physical
memory, but instead gather memory layout information and work with the MMU
(or the PROM) to make sure we can actually load the kernel image in a proper
contiguous physical memory area.

In order to do this, we look at the kernel image twice; during the first pass,
the kernel footprint is computed, and then after making sure it can be
loaded, the second pass loads the actual image.

Since such a logic doesn't work on media which can not seek backwards, such
as tapes, we check for the boot device being a tape and, in that case, assume
a fixed (generous) image size and don't load the kernel symbol table (to
avoid seeking backwards); since tape boot is supposed to be only used to
boot bsd.rd, this is something we can live with.

While there, lower the address the boot blocks are loaded in memory, because
the last crank did not work with some early sun4c OpenPROM, which only
map about 3.5MB of memory.

Memory games logic from NetBSD, tape handling by me.
