/*
 * if_sunie.h
 *
 * sun's ie interface
 */

/*
 * programming notes:
 *
 * the ie chip operates in a 24 bit address space.
 *
 * most ie interfaces appear to be divided into two parts:
 *	 - generic 586 stuff
 *	 - board specific
 *
 * generic:
 *	the generic stuff of the ie chip is all done with data structures
 * 	that live in the chip's memory address space.   the chip expects
 * 	its main data structure (the sys conf ptr -- SCP) to be at a fixed
 * 	address in its 24 bit space: 0xfffff4
 *
 *      the SCP points to another structure called the ISCP.
 *      the ISCP points to another structure called the SCB.
 * 	the SCB has a status field, a linked list of "commands", and
 * 	a linked list of "receive buffers".   these are data structures that
 * 	live in memory, not registers.
 *
 * board:
 * 	to get the chip to do anything, you first put a command in the
 * 	command data structure list.   then you have to signal "attention"
 * 	to the chip to get it to look at the command.   how you
 * 	signal attention depends on what board you have... on PC's
 * 	there is an i/o port number to do this, on sun's there is a
 * 	register bit you toggle.
 *
 * 	to get data from the chip you program it to interrupt...
 *
 *
 * sun issues:
 *
 *      there are 3 kinds of sun "ie" interfaces:
 *        1 - a VME/multibus card
 *        2 - an on-board interface (sun3's, sun-4/100's, and sun-4/200's)
 *        3 - another VME board called the 3E
 *
 * 	the VME boards lives in vme16 space.   only 16 and 8 bit accesses
 * 	are allowed, so functions that copy data must be aware of this.
 *
 * 	the chip is an intel chip.  this means that the byte order
 * 	on all the "short"s in the chip's data structures is wrong.
 * 	so, constants described in the intel docs are swapped for the sun.
 * 	that means that any buffer pointers you give the chip must be
 * 	swapped to intel format.   yuck.
 *
 *   VME/multibus interface:
 * 	for the multibus interface the board ignores the top 4 bits
 * 	of the chip address.   the multibus interface seems to have its
 * 	own MMU like page map (without protections or valid bits, etc).
 * 	there are 256 pages of physical memory on the board (each page
 * 	is 1024 bytes).   there are 1024 slots in the page map.  so,
 * 	a 1024 byte page takes up 10 bits of address for the offset,
 * 	and if there are 1024 slots in the page that is another 10 bits
 * 	of the address.   that makes a 20 bit address, and as stated
 * 	earlier the board ignores the top 4 bits, so that accounts
 * 	for all 24 bits of address.
 *
 * 	note that the last entry of the page map maps the top of the
 * 	24 bit address space and that the SCP is supposed to be at
 * 	0xfffff4 (taking into account allignment).   so,
 *	for multibus, that entry in the page map has to be used for the SCP.
 *
 * 	the page map effects BOTH how the ie chip sees the
 * 	memory, and how the host sees it.
 *
 * 	the page map is part of the "register" area of the board
 *
 *   on-board interface:
 *
 *	<fill in useful info later>
 *
 *
 *   VME3E interface:
 *
 *	<fill in useful info later>
