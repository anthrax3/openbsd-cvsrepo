1.3
log
@Convert sparc console code from rcons and pseudo-devices to rasops and wscons.
For most framebuffers it is faster.

Other changes include:
o 24 bit support in tcx(4) for the S24 framebuffer
o accelerated cgsix(4) text console
o new cgtwelve(4) driver for the GS framebuffer
o improved serial driver code
o better keyboard support

The following framebuffers have not been tested but should work: cgfour,
cgeight and cgfourteen

These changes will require XF4 changes, to use Xwsfb instead of Xsun*, to be
commited later today.

Most of the work by me during the LSM and the week after, with code borrowed
from jason@@, NetBSD (new serial code), and feedback from mickey@@. Work on
pnozz(4) done by millert@@
