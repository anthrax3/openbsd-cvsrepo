@Unify the zs tty driver.

Most of the hard work by mpi@@, who provided the initial diff.
Fixes for sparc from myself. Tested on sgi and sparc myself.
Compiles and detects zstty on my powerbook, compile tested on
sparc64 by me. Real testing with zs device on sparc64 by miod@@
who also gave a lot of help and feedback.

@generic soft interrupts support for sparc. Soft interrupt handlers are now
kept in a separate intrhand array, with their own enable bits so that
soft interrupts sharing the same level only get invoked if really triggered.
Inspired by NetBSD with significant changes.

@Convert sparc console code from rcons and pseudo-devices to rasops and wscons.
For most framebuffers it is faster.

Other changes include:
o 24 bit support in tcx(4) for the S24 framebuffer
o accelerated cgsix(4) text console
o new cgtwelve(4) driver for the GS framebuffer
o improved serial driver code
o better keyboard support

The following framebuffers have not been tested but should work: cgfour,
cgeight and cgfourteen

These changes will require XF4 changes, to use Xwsfb instead of Xsun*, to be
commited later today.

Most of the work by me during the LSM and the week after, with code borrowed
from jason@@, NetBSD (new serial code), and feedback from mickey@@. Work on
pnozz(4) done by millert@@
