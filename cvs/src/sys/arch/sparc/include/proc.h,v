log
@"TLS-lite": add kernel support for a per-thread userspace pointer,
for pointing to the thread-control-block.  Support for mapping this
to the correct hardware register can be added as it's finished;
start with support for amd64, sparc, and sparc64.  Includes syscalls
for getting and setting it (for a portable __errno implementation) as
well as creating a new thread with an initial value for it.

discussed with miod@@, kettenis@@, deraadt@@; committing to get the syscalls
in with the impending libc bump and do further refinements in tree

@Misaligned load/store recovery code in the kernel, enabled by T_FIXALIGN
userland traps on a per-process basis, were necessary for *some* SunOS
binaries on sparc, which had to compiled with explicit misaligned access code
generation (i.e. for vendors to release a working SunOS/sparc version of their
code until they could fix their bogus code).

There is no reason to keep this code on sparc64, and now that we don't provide
COMPAT_SUNOS anymore, there is no reason to keep this code on sparc.
