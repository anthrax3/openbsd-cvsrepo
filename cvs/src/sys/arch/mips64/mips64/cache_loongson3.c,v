1.2
log
@Some implementations of HitSyncDCache() call pmap_extract() for va->pa
conversion. Because pmap_extract() acquires the PTE mutex, a "locking
against myself" panic is triggered if the cache routine gets called in
a context where the mutex is already held.

In the pmap, all calls to HitSyncDCache() are for a whole page. Add a
new cache routine, HitSyncDCachePage(), which gets both the va and the
pa of a page. This removes the need of the va->pa conversion. The new
routine has the same signature as SyncDCachePage(), allowing reuse of
the same routine for cache implementations that do not need differences
between "Hit" and non-"Hit" routines.

With the diff, POWER Indigo2 R8000 boots multiuser again. Tested on sgi
GENERIC-IP27.MP and octeon GENERIC.MP, too.
