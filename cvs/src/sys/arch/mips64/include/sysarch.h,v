1.1
log
@Add an implementation of IRIX-compatible cacheflush() routine to mips ports,
needed for gcc -ftrampoline operation as well as by some third-party
software.
Although the implementation uses the sysarch() sysctl, the wrapper is
added to libc as it was a direct system call (which it is on IRIX).
