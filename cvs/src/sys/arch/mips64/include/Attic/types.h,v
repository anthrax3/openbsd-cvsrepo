@Merge machine/ansi.h and machine/types.h into machine/_types.h and
rename the types using the __ protected namespace (e.g. __size_t).
Idea from FreeBSD.

@So mips64 is our first arch that switches to using new MI
timecounter code.
The only available timecounter now is CP0 count register. We'll
have more once we get support for embedded CPUs like NEC VR41xx.

Tested on sgi by hshoexer@@ and kettenis@@; ok pefo@@.
