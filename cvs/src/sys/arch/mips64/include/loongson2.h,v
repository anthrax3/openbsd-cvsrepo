@On second thought, do not unconditionnaly register the cpu throttling code
on all Loongson2F systems yet; Gdium does not have a separate scheduling
clock yet and can't afford throttling until then.

/*
 * Address Window registers physical addresses
 *
 * The Loongson 2F processor has an AXI crossbar with four possible bus
 * masters, each one having four programmable address windows.
 *
 * Each window is defined with three 64-bit registers:
 * - a base address register, defining the address in the master address
 *   space (base register).
 * - an address mask register, defining which address bits are valid in this
 *   window.  A given address matches a window if (addr & mask) == base.
 * - the location of the window base in the target, as well at the target
 *   number itself (mmap register). The lower 20 bits of the address are
 *   forced as zeroes regardless of their value in this register.
 *   The translated address is thus (addr & ~mask) | (mmap & ~0xfffff).

@Normalize sentinel. Use _MACHINE_*_H_ and _<ARCH>_*_H_ properly and consitently.

Discussed and okay drahn@@. Okay deraadt@@.

@The RA stack control bit on the loongson2 diagnostic register is not a clear
but a disable bit; rename the define and keep the RA stack disabled at all
times - I blame the few remaining hard freezes on it.

log
@Work in progress support for Loongson2E/2F processors; need option CPU_LOONGSON2
in the kernel to be brought in, due to invasive differences in tlb operation.
Comes with a separate cache operations file due to the cache being R5k-style
with R10k-style way number encoding.
