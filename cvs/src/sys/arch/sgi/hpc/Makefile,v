1.1
log
@Yet another evil awk script (not perl, I'm not in LibreSSL mode at the moment)
to convert the PS/2 keyboard layouts to SGI serial keyboard layouts.

Only the subset of layouts known to have existed (as listed in IRIX's
<sys/kbd.h> header) get converted, and specific flavours (iopener, dec LK)
are ignored as well. `nodead' flavours, when existing, are preserved.
