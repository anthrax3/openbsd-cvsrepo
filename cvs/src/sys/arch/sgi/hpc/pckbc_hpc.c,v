@Follow the recent pckbc@@isa changes and always establish all the necessary
interrupts at pckbc attach time, and get rid of the `intr_establish'
pckbc callback.

Tested on hppa (gsckbc) and sgi (pckbc@@hpc); not tested on sparc64 (pckbc@@ebus)
but this attachment was already behaving this way and its intr_establish
callback was an empty function.

log
@Drivers for the Indy and Indigo 2 PS/2 keyboard ports, and the ``Newport''
(NG1, XL, XGE) frame buffer.
Adapted from NetBSD; newport extended to support underline and fonts wider than
8 pixels, such as the default 12x22 Gallant font. Framebuffer depth computation
seems to be wrong on Indy models, to be investigated later (but doesn't prevent
text console from working).
