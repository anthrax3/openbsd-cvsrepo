log
@Split the existing impact@@xbow attachment into generic impact routines, and
bus-specific attachment; impactreg.h and impactvar.h move from sgi/xbow/ to
sgi/dev/.

Teach the generic impact code how to code with pre-ImpactSR boards, which have
a slightly different register layout (information obtained from Peter Fuerst's
Linux IP28 patches).

Add an impact@@gio attachment (unfortunately untested, no Impact GIO boards
here). All Indigo 2 graphics options should be supported now (assuming the
Extreme/Ultra will actually work with grtwo(4) out of the box).

Tested not to disturb operation on IP30.

** ATTENTION! If you are building IP27 or IP30 kernels, be sure to rm impact.d
** before building a new kernel.
