@Remove xhub boilerplate; Hub doesn't appear as a widget itself but as the
connecting part of the XBow, as advertized by the KL graph. Hub specific
code already exists in xbow.c and will remain there.

log
@A first cut at XBow bus support, very minimal, limited to a local bus only;
HUB driver (for IP27) is a stub, and interrupt support is a shoot in the dark
and will need some serious debugging until it is sane, but I want to reduce
the weight of these diffs first.

Based on a lot of tinkering and experiments, as well as knowledge extracted
from the Linux source code.
