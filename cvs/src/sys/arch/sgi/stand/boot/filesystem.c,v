@Teach the bootblocks how to load kernel from tftp (i.e. when OSLoadPartition
is bootp() instead of a disk). Kind of ugly because of the usual `can't seek'
problem causing kernels with symbols to be read from the network twice.

While there, add a 32 bit ECOFF boot block, not hooked to the build yet,
to be used shortly.
