@Obtain struct sgi_device_location for the console input and output devices,
and compare against them when attaching potential console drivers, to figure
out whether they indeed are acting are console devices or not.

@Allow iockbc(4) and odysseey(4) to act as console devices and attach early;
this gives us working glass console on Fuel, as well as on Octane systems
with Odyssey graphics.

@Make iof(4) pass its bus speed to children, this in turn allows com(4) to
pick the right clock if the PCI bus the I/O board is on degrades to 33MHz.

@Blind partial support for IOC4 chip, found on IO8 and IO9 base I/O boards on
Origin 350 and Tezro systems. While this chip provides serial ports, an ATAPI
interface and a PS/2 keyboard and mouse interface, this code currently only
attempts to support the serial ports.
