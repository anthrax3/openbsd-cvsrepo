log
@Kernel builds now happen in compile/CONFIG/obj@@ -> /usr/obj/... [or ./obj/,
if srctree is not rooted at /usr/src].  As a result, stock GENERIC & RAMDISK
kernels are commited to the tree, to ensure the src tree can be "readonly"
during builds, with all writes occuring inside the obj space.  config -b
options are handled by ../Makefile.inc.  The canonical new way to configure
one of these kernels is:
    % cd /sys/arch/amd64/compile/GENERIC.MP
    % doas make obj
    % make config
    % make
    % doas cp obj/bsd /bsd
The build infrastructure will use this new mechanism in a de-escalation
way using BUILDUSER.
Much help from natano and tb.

@Work in progress support for the Power Indigo2 R8000 system (IP26). This is
basically an IP22 system (R4000 Indigo2) with the ECC memory board of IP28,
and a so-called ``streaming'' L2 cache.

IP26 kernels currently boot single-user, but don't live long; I am suspecting
a bug in the tcc cache routines, but am currently not able to find it (come
to think of it, my understanding of how this cache works could be wrong, and
of course there is no documentation for it but what can be gathered from
IRIX' <sys/IP26.h> comments and defines).

Hopefully this situation will improve in the near future; in the meantime I
am commiting this as `work in progress' to make sure this code doesn't get
lost.

@Work in progress support for the SGI Indigo, Indigo 2 and Indy systems
(IP20, IP22, IP24) in 64-bit mode, adapated from NetBSD. Currently limited
to headless operation, input and video drivers will get ported soon.

Should work on all R4000, R4440 and R5000 based systems. L2 cache on R5000SC
Indy not supported yet (coming soon), R4600 not supported yet either (coming
soon as well).

Tested to boot multiuser on: Indigo2 R4000SC, Indy R4000PC, Indy R4000SC,
Indy R5000SC, Indigo2 R4400SC. There are still glitches in the Ethernet driver
which are being looked at.

Expansion support is limited to the GIO E++ board; GIO boards with PCI-GIO
bridges not ported yet due to the lack of hardware, and this kind of driver
does not port blindly.

Most of this work comes from NetBSD, polishing and integration work, as well
as putting as many ``R4x00 in 64-bit mode'' erratas as necessary, by yours
truly.

More work is coming, as well as trying to get some easy way to boot install
kernels (as older PROM can only boot ECOFF binaries, which won't do for the
kernel).
