@refactor sys/param.h and machine/param.h.  A lot of #ifdef _KERNEL is added
to keep definitions our of user space.  The MD files now follow a consistant
order -- all namespace intrusion is at the tail can be cleaned up
independently.  locore, bootblocks, and libkvm still see enough visibility to
build.  Checked on 90% of platforms...

@Change the page size computation logic to default to 16KB pages, and only
restrict to 4KB if the kernel is configured with R5000 or RM7000 family support.

Allow the kernel configuration to override this if it knows better (e.g. an
upcoming kernel configuration with support for R5000, but where physical
memory on R5000 systems fits within the first 512MB).

@Support for 16KB page size kernels; page size is now set in <machine/param.h>
rather than <mips64/param.h>.

For now, kernels are kept at 4KB to give people some time to build 16KB
compatible binaries; this will change before the end of this release cycle.

Use of 16KB page size kernels yields a 18% speedup (which, offset by the
1.6% slowdown caused by the pmap changes, yields a 16.6% overall speedup).
