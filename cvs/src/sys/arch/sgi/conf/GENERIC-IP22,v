@According to Linux, and just verified the hard way, the 8254 timer does not
interrupt on Indy; do not use it on such systems. Then, bring back a clock0 at
mainbus attachment to IP22 kernels, and attach it late in the autoconf process
if no other device has claimed the clock yet.

This means R4000 and R4400 based Indy may experience the lost clock interrupt
processor errata again, until a better way to skirt it is found.

log
@A known errata of R4000 and R4400 processors, is that reading the internal
counter register close to a trigger of the counter interrupt, may cause the
interrupt not to be generated. This makes it a bad idea to use the internal
counter both for the scheduling clock and for delay().

Therefore, on IP22 systems (and IP28 because it makes my life easier), use
one of the two 8254 timers connected to the onboard interrupt controller as
the scheduling clock source.

Adapted from NetBSD.

needs to be bus_dma'ified).

@Split the existing impact@@xbow attachment into generic impact routines, and
bus-specific attachment; impactreg.h and impactvar.h move from sgi/xbow/ to
sgi/dev/.

Teach the generic impact code how to code with pre-ImpactSR boards, which have
a slightly different register layout (information obtained from Peter Fuerst's
Linux IP28 patches).

Add an impact@@gio attachment (unfortunately untested, no Impact GIO boards
here). All Indigo 2 graphics options should be supported now (assuming the
Extreme/Ultra will actually work with grtwo(4) out of the box).

Tested not to disturb operation on IP30.

** ATTENTION! If you are building IP27 or IP30 kernels, be sure to rm impact.d
** before building a new kernel.

@Drivers for the Indy and Indigo 2 PS/2 keyboard ports, and the ``Newport''

Adapted from NetBSD; newport extended to support underline and fonts wider than
8 pixels, such as the default 12x22 Gallant font. Framebuffer depth computation
seems to be wrong on Indy models, to be investigated later (but doesn't prevent
text console from working).

@Work in progress support for the SGI Indigo, Indigo 2 and Indy systems
(IP20, IP22, IP24) in 64-bit mode, adapated from NetBSD. Currently limited
to headless operation, input and video drivers will get ported soon.

Should work on all R4000, R4440 and R5000 based systems. L2 cache on R5000SC
Indy not supported yet (coming soon), R4600 not supported yet either (coming
soon as well).

Tested to boot multiuser on: Indigo2 R4000SC, Indy R4000PC, Indy R4000SC,
Indy R5000SC, Indigo2 R4400SC. There are still glitches in the Ethernet driver
which are being looked at.

Expansion support is limited to the GIO E++ board; GIO boards with PCI-GIO
bridges not ported yet due to the lack of hardware, and this kind of driver
does not port blindly.

Most of this work comes from NetBSD, polishing and integration work, as well
as putting as many ``R4x00 in 64-bit mode'' erratas as necessary, by yours
truly.

More work is coming, as well as trying to get some easy way to boot install
kernels (as older PROM can only boot ECOFF binaries, which won't do for the
kernel).
