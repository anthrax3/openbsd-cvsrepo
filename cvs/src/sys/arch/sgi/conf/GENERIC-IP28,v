log
@A known errata of R4000 and R4400 processors, is that reading the internal
counter register close to a trigger of the counter interrupt, may cause the
interrupt not to be generated. This makes it a bad idea to use the internal
counter both for the scheduling clock and for delay().

Therefore, on IP22 systems (and IP28 because it makes my life easier), use
one of the two 8254 timers connected to the onboard interrupt controller as
the scheduling clock source.

@Be more strict when specifying hpc child device attachments: specific
onboard devices need only attach to hpc0 instead of hpc?.
While there, remove hpc1 and hpc2 attachment from IP28 configurations, as these
can not exist on Indigo2 systems.
