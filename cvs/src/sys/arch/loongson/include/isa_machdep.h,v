@Huge work-in-progress commit to support Loongson 2E-based evaluation boards
with a VIA 686 southbridge.

Features:
- 686 setup code (no thanks to PMON for not initializing the beast).
- work in progress ISA interrupt handling code.
- support for vga(4) compatible devices as console, in PC-compatible text mode.
- move legacy (ISA) support code out of bonito(4) to make things clearer.
- support more than 256MB on 2E-based systems.

Tested on a generic 2E-based evaluation board by someone who wishes to remain
anonymous; you know who you are, thank you very much for testing.

@By popular demand and peer pressure, check-in work in progress work to support
the Yeelong Lemote mips-based netbook. Kernel bits only for now, needs
polishing; most of this work done during h2k9 last month, although the
porting effort started earlier this year.
