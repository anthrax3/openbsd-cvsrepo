1.1
log
@Work in progress standalone boot blocks for OpenBSD/loongson systems. Will
load a kernel from the OpenBSD partition, with symbols.
However:
- does not work on gdium (usb i/o errors)
- no countdown due to PMON limitations, so either `bsd' in the PMON
  environment contains a kernel filename to load, and it will get loaded
  immediately, or it doesn't (e.g. the variable does no exist) and you get
  a prompt and can pass options to the kernel. Note that /etc/boot.conf
  commands can still be used in both cases.
- does not work for me when loaded automatically from PMON (put in the `al'
  environment variable). However, `boot $al' works fine. Need to investigate.
