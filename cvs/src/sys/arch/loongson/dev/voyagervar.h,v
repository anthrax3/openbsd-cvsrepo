log
@Subdevice interrupt dispatcher for voyager(4) and ohci@@voyager device, only
allowed to match on old gdium artwork, as newer artwork have nothing
connected to the usb pins, and this causes the empty bus probe to stall the
boot a few seconds.

1.1
log
@Add a master driver for the VoyagerGX SM502 chip found on the Gdium, which is
not only a framebuffer. Allow smfb to attach either at pci or at voyager.

Add gpio@@voyager and gdiumiic@@gpio, a derivative of the MI gpioiic driver.
This allows us to get lmtemp@@iic on the Lemote; the next step being to
write a driver for the i2c todclock chip found on the same bus.
