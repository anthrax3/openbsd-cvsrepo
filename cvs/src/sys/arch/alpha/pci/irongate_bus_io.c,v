log
@First pass at removing clauses 3 and 4 from NetBSD licenses.

Not sure what's more surprising: how long it took for NetBSD to

actual authors.

OK deraadt@@

@Update the SMP branch to -current, this breaks the SMP branch though.
But it will be fixed soonish.  Note, nothing new has happened, this is just
a merge of the trunk into this branch.
