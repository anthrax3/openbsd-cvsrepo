@First pass at removing clauses 3 and 4 from NetBSD licenses.

Not sure what's more surprising: how long it took for NetBSD to
catch up to the rest of the BSDs (including UCB), or the amount of
code that NetBSD has claimed for itself without attributing to the
actual authors.

OK deraadt@@

 * Address map.
 *
 * This from the Tsunami address map:
 * EV6 has a new superpage which can pass through 44 address bits.  (Umm, a
 * superduperpage?) But, the firmware doesn't turn it on, so we use the old
 * one and let the HW sign extend va/pa<40> to get us the pa<43> that makes
 * the needed I/O space access. This is just as well; it means we don't have
 * to worry about which GENERIC code might get called on other CPU models.
 *
 *	E.g., we want this:		0x0801##fc00##0000
 *	We use this:			0x0101##fc00##0000
 *	...mix in the old SP:     0xffff##fc00##0000##0000
 *	...after PA sign ext:     0xffff##ff01##fc00##0000
 *	(PA<42:41> ignored)
 *
 * PCI memory and RAM:			0000.0000.0000
 * IACK					0001.f800.0000
 * PCI I/O:				0001.fc00.0000
 * AMD 751 (also in PCI config space):	0001.fe00.0000

1.2.2.1
log
@Update the SMP branch to -current, this breaks the SMP branch though.
But it will be fixed soonish.  Note, nothing new has happened, this is just
a merge of the trunk into this branch.
