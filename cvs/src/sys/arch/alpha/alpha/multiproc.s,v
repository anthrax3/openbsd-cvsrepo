@Work in progress work towards SMP, heavily based upon NetBSD. The MP kernel
will boot multiuser, but will deadlock under load, and I can't find my
mistake yet.

log
@First pass at removing clauses 3 and 4 from NetBSD licenses.

Not sure what's more surprising: how long it took for NetBSD to
catch up to the rest of the BSDs (including UCB), or the amount of
code that NetBSD has claimed for itself without attributing to the
actual authors.

@Replace STABS debug info (which causes problems with truncated relocations)
with some limited DWARF2 generating .file and .line symbols.  Makes it possible
to build kernels with debug information again.

1.2.2.1

@Update the SMP branch to -current, this breaks the SMP branch though.
But it will be fixed soonish.  Note, nothing new has happened, this is just
a merge of the trunk into this branch.

1.1
log
@Merge in big portions of the improvements NetBSD did to their alpha port.
Highlights: UVM, PMAP_NEW, bus_dma (only on some buses for now), new hardware
support, possiblity for ELF, etc, etc. Too much to mention.

This is still work in progress. video consoles might be broken, otherwise
we have basically the same functionality as before plus more.
