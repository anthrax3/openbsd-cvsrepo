.Dt INSTALLBOOT 8 alpha
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm installboot
.Nd install disk bootstrap software
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm installboot
.Op Fl nv
.Ar boot
.Ar bootxx
.Ar rawdiskdevice
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm installboot
utility prepares a disk for bootstrapping.
.Pp
The OpenBSD/alpha disk bootstrap software is split into two parts:
a small first-stage boot program that is written into the disklabel
area of a disk
.Po
and hence is limited in size to 7680 bytes
.Pc ,
and a second-stage boot program that resides in the filesystem proper
.Po
typically with the name
.Pa /boot
.Pc .
The first-stage boot program is loaded into memory by the SRM console
software.
After receiving control of the system, it loads the second-stage boot
program from a set of filesystem block numbers that have been
hard-coded into it by
.Nm installboot .
The second-stage boot program locates and loads the kernel.
.Pp
The second-stage boot program and the prototype code for the
first-stage boot program can be found in
.Pa /usr/mdec/boot
and
.Pa /usr/mdec/bootxx ,
respectively.
.Pa /usr/mdec/boot
may be installed simply by copying it to the root directory of the
partition you wish to boot from, but after it is installed
.Nm installboot
.Em must
be run.
.Pp
The options recognized by
.Nm installboot
are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width flag
.It Fl n
Do not actually write anything on the disk.
.It Fl v
Verbose mode.
.El
.Pp
The arguments are:
.Bl -tag -width rawdiskdevice
.It Ar boot
The name of the second-stage boot program in the file system
where the first-stage boot program is to be installed.
.It Ar bootxx
The name of the prototype file for the first-stage boot program.
.It Ar rawdiskdevice
The name of the device corresponding to the raw whole-disk partition (the
.Dq raw partition )
of the disk on which the first-stage boot program is to be installed.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Pa boot
resides in the FFS file system mounted on
.Pa /
from
.Dq sd0a ,
you would install the first-stage boot program on the disk
(and therefore make the disk bootable) by using the command:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# cp /usr/mdec/boot /boot
# /usr/mdec/installboot -n -v /boot /usr/mdec/bootxx /dev/rsd0c
.Ed
.Pp
And if the information supplied looks right, run the above without the
.Fl n
flag.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr disklabel 8 ,
.Xr init 8 ,
.Xr sysctl 8
.Sh HISTORY
The alpha
.Nm
command first appeared in
.Nx 1.2 .
.Sh BUGS
The OpenBSD/alpha boot blocks can only load kernels from disks'
.Dq a
partitions.
(However, the second-stage boot program may be located on any FFS file system
partition on the disk.)

.Pp
.Nm Installboot
requires simultaneous access to the mounted file system and
the disks' raw partition.
That is not allowed with the kernel
.Dv securelevel
variable
.Po
see
.Xr sysctl 8
.Pc
set to a value greater than one, or with
.Dv securelevel
set to one if the
.Dq boot
program resides in a file system on the disk's raw partition.

@- remove all trailing whitespace

- fix remaining .Nm usage as well
- this is from a patch I received from kwesterback@@home.com, who has been
  working on some scripts for fixing formatting errors in mdoc'd man pages

Ok, so there could be a cost/benefit debate with this commit, but since I have
the patch we might as well commit it...

1.3
log
@Updates from NetBSD (cgd):
 - seriously clean up makefiles.  use libsa/libkern/libz as appropriate,
   and don't build the various sources into objs locally by specifying
   them directly in the Makefiles.
 - move the secondary bootstrap down (to 0x20004000), and add a HEAP_LIMIT
   so that we don't exhaust our bootstrap address space (when using the new,
   not yet checked in, memory allocator).
 - clean up installboot, deal with secondary bootstrap programs not on
   'a' partition or 'a' partition not starting at 0.
 - add padding to structures in bbinfo.h for future expansion.  Add a
   netbbinfo structure to allow netboot information to be hard-coded in
   network boot blocks, so that they can be made to work even on systems
   with firmware which doesn't support the new "ethernet address in boot
   device" convention.
 - move the sync() calls to the correct place in installboot.c
 - remove a kludge in disk.c which was breaking multiple opens/closes
   of the disk
 - allow netboot ethernet address to be hard-coded into binary so that
   machines with old firmware which doesn't pass it in the boot device
   can work.  Assume that if the ethernet address isn't passed in, it
   uses the old (dain-bramaged) 'read' interface works on my 3000/300LX.
 - Add setnetbootinfo, a program to hard code an ethernet address into
   a network boot.
 - move an 'int debug;' into boot.c (it was the only diff between boot.c and
   netboot.c), and nuke netboot.c (using boot.c instead for net boot blocks).
 - add cd9660 file system ops to the file system ops table in filesystem.c
 - if a file name is given (i.e. BOOTED_FILE) is set, boot only that file,
   but if not then try to boot "bsd", "bsd.bak", "bsd.old", and
   "obsd" (in that order) until one is found or until the list of names
   is exhausted.
 - add support for reading gzipped kernels.
 - use strerror() to print errors, rather than just printing error numbers
 - if no disk label exists, fake one up
 - slightly relax the block size checks in bootxx.c; they were a bit to paranoid

And local changes:
 - don't build a copy of libsa/libkern/libz for each boot prog,
   just build a single copy and use it for everything.

the ``c'' partition spans the entire disk and
should not be mounted.
