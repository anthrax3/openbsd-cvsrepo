The OpenBSD/Alpha "User" To-Do List


The following are things that we'd like to see "users" of OpenBSD/Alpha
do.  It's unlikely that we'll get around to them in any reasonable time
frame, and we think they should get done.

If you think of something that should be added to this list send us
mail and we'll add it.

If you're planning to work on something on this list, send us mail at
alpha@@openbsd.org and tell us about it, so that we can keep people from
duplicating work.


This document is derived from the NetBSD version originally written by
Chris Demetriou <cgd@@cs.cmu.edu>.

Fix DEC 3000/x00 support.

Test TurboChannel option slot support.  Write TurboChannel option
board drivers.  Test PMAD-A (TC le) driver.

Add isadma support.

Add floppy support (requires isadma).

Add WSS (audio) support (requires isadma).@

@Update the SMP branch to -current, this breaks the SMP branch though.
But it will be fixed soonish.  Note, nothing new has happened, this is just
a merge of the trunk into this branch.

Get the GNU tools to generate a.out binaries for the alpha.  Once that
is done, make the rest of the NetBSD a.out-manipulation tools (e.g. nm)
work.

Make DDB work.  (For completeness, may require a.out kernel binaries
and/or some ecoff symbol handling code to be written; the former is
strongly preferred.)

Make TurboChannel option slots work reasonably.  This will require
    different sets of code to be written on the 3000/[4-9]00 and on the
    3000/300 families.  It shouldn't be too hard, but you will need some
    devices that live in option slots.
