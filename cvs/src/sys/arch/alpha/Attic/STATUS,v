OpenBSD/Alpha's Status

If you find an inaccuracy in this file, can clarify it in any place,
etc., please send mail to alpha@@openbsd.org.


Supported hardware:

	AlphaStation {200,250,255,400} systems using the following
	peripherals:

		Supported hardware:
			NCR 53c810 SCSI (built-in or PCI board).
			Built-in ns16550 serial ports.
			DC21040-based ethernet (built-in or PCI board).
			DC21140-based PCI ethernet boards.
			DC21050-based PCI-PCI bridges (though other
			    types of PCI-PCI bridges should work).
			PCI VGA video boards.
			DEC ZLXp-E1 (DC21030-based, "TGA") video boards.
			Keyboard.
			PS/2-style mice.

		Things that may work but haven't been tested:
			Built-in parallel ports.
			ISA ns16x50-family serial port boards.
			ISA ns16x50 multi-port serial boards.
			Other NCR 53c8xx SCSI boards.

		Things that ARE NOT supported at this time:
			Sound hardware (including Windows Sound System
			    built-in on some machines).
			DEC ZLXp-E2 and ZLXp-E3 PCI video boards.
			Other PCI boards.

	AlphaStation 500 and 600 systems, with the same supported
	hardware list as the AlphaStation {200,250,255,400} systems.
	(NOTE THAT THAT MEANS THE AlphaStation 600's BUILT-IN SCSI
	CONTROLLERS DO NOT WORK.  You'll need to get a 53c810 board,
	or run diskless.)

	AXPpci systems (including Multia), with the same supported
	hardware list as the AlphaStation {200,250,255,400} systems.

	EB164 (AlphaPC 164) systems, with the same supported hardware
	as systems mentioned above.

At this time none of the following systems are supported:
	DEC 3000/[3456789]00
	DECpc AXP 150 systems (EISA-bus PC-like systems)
	Alpha "server" systems (other than perhaps the
	    AlphaServer 400, which might be an AlphaStation 400
	    in disguise).
	Multiprocessor Alpha systems

Console frame buffers & keyboard are supported only with the frame
buffers and keyboards mentioned as supported above.  On other systems
(including all TurboChannel-based machines), OpenBSD/Alpha _must_ be used
with a serial console.  To configure various Alpha systems to use a serial
console, do the following depending on the model:

	DEC 3000/[4-9]00's:
		Flip the appropriate switch on the back of the machine.

	DEC 3000/300 family machines:
		Boot the machine with the keyboard/mouse connector
		unplugged.

	DECpc AXPs, AlphaStations, AXPpci, and EB164 systems:
		Get to the console prompt.  Set the variable
		"console" to be "serial", and "init" or power cycle
		the system.

See your owner's manual for more details on how to set your machine
to use a serial console.


See the file src/sys/arch/alpha/README to find out how to get the
latest sources and binaries.

Please see the file src/sys/arch/alpha/TODO.users for a list of things
that users can do to help OpenBSD/Alpha improve.  If you're interested
in doing any of them, or porting to new hardware, get in touch and
I'll do what I can to help.

NetBSD/Alpha has actually been run on the following types of machines:
	DEC 3000/400
	DEC 3000/600
	[ XXX THERE ARE MORE; if you're running it on a machine not
	    listed, mail me about it.]
d29 27

	DECpc AXP systems -- the Alpha systems with EISA busses
	AlphaStations -- the Alpha systems with PCI busses (i.e.
	    PCI/ISA or PCI/EISA)
	The Futurebus-based Alpha server systems
	The multiprocessor Alpha systems

I am in the process of porting NetBSD/Alpha to the PCI-based systems,
in particular, to the AlphaStation 400 4/233.  I was hoping to get a
DECpc AXP port working "for free" based on the PCI work, but the
DECpc AXP is a very different (and, in my opinion, very alien) piece
of hardware.  If somebody wants to make NetBSD/Alpha run on the
DECpc AXP system, get in touch and I'll do what I can to help you
get started.  (Right now, it can detect devices on the EISA bus, etc.,
but the I/O layout is distinctly _not_ what I'd expected and/or hoped
for.  It's significantly more difficult to deal with than I'd expected.)

It's unclear how much support for other PCI-based systems (i.e. the
AlphaStation 200 and AlphaStation 250 machines) will be won by getting
the AlphaStation 400 supported.  It should at least make porting to
those machines easier.


Because no frame buffers are supported, NetBSD/Alpha _must_ be used with
a serial console.  To do that on:
d77 1
d83 5
a87 41
	DECpc AXP's and AlphaStations:
		Boot the machine with the keyboard unplugged.  (Note:
		I've never actually booted one of these machines with
		a serial console, so I can't verify that this is
		correct.  Also, people who've booted test kernels for
		me have reported trouble using these boxes with a
		serial console, but I'm not sure why; the kernel for
		these systems is not advanced enough to have its own
		serial driver yet, and so is using the PROM routines.)

There actually is hope of getting somebody to come up with working
graphics board drivers and even an X server.  More on that as things
develop.


Getting people running with my latest sources still isn't as easy as
it should be; not all of my sources are integrated into the NetBSD
master source tree yet.  Most of the diffs are in, however, and I
suggest the following tactic for people who are trying to get running
with an "up to date" system:

	Get the latest NetBSD sources from:
	ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-current/src/tar_files

	Replace that 'sys' tree with the latest snapshot I've put up
	for ftp under the directory:
	ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/arch/alpha

	If you'd like to compile the compiler and tool chain, add to
	that the GNU tools tree (src/devo) from my original source
	distribution tar file, which can also be found under:
	ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/arch/alpha
	(Unfortunately, there's not a way to get just that part of the
	source distribution; I'll fix that in a day or two.)

That won't be perfect, but it'll get you most of the way there.

I'm planning to put up a new 'sys' snapshot, as well as new kernel
image, in a couple of days.  Hopefully by that time, all of the
user-land changes will have been merged into the master NetBSD source
tree.
