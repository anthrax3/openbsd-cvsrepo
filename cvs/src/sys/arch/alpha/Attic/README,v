[ Don't trust this file yet, it contains a lot of inaccuracies.  When it's
  ready, this notice will be removed.  -NH ]

Obtaining OpenBSD/Alpha sources and binaries:

	OpenBSD/Alpha's sources, with the exceptions of the GNU
	toolchain and X11 code, are integrated into OpenBSD-current,
	and are available from:
		ftp://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/

	The latest OpenBSD/Alpha binary snapshot, and source snapshots
	for the toolchain and X11 code, can be found at:
		ftp://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/arch/alpha

	Binary snapshots include two different set of system binaries:
		(1) an rz25 disk image, for first-time installation
		    (see below for instructions), and
		(2) three tar files of the binaries, for updates.
		    (one of the tar files is the contents of /etc,
		    one contains X11 binaries, and the last is everything
		    else, except the kernel and the installed boot block.)
		    There are no instructions on how to use these.
		    Good luck!  8-)

	Binary snapshots include a kernel image which is the same
	as the one on the rz25 disk image.

	The sources provided seperately from the normal OpenBSD-current
	distribution are:
		(1) complete compiler toolchain sources
		(2) diffs against the XFree86 3.1.2 distribution to
		    make X work with OpenBSD/Alpha.  (Note that
		    at this time, the diffs are against 3.1.2,
		    i.e. not against 3.1.2D, etc.)
	
	If you are using or are interested in the OpenBSD/Alpha port, I
	suggest that you subscribe to the OpenBSD "port-alpha" mailing list
	by sending an email message to majordomo@@openbsd.org with no
	subject and with a body of "subscribe port-alpha" (without the
	quotes).  For help on using majordomo, send it mail with an empty
	subject and body.  In general, questions about OpenBSD/Alpha
	are best asked on that mailing list (rather than by sending me
	mail directly).

Installing the OpenBSD/Alpha distribution:

	[ Note that these instructions are minimal; it's assumed that if
	  you're going to be installing this, you're knowledgeable about
	  booting Alphas and doing sysadmin-ish stuff, are willing to look
	  in your Alpha documentation, or are brave.  If they're really not
	  good enough to get you running, get in touch with me and I'll try
	  to help you. ]

	To install the OpenBSD/Alpha distribution, you'll need a disk at
	least the size of an RZ25 -- about 406Mb.  Once you've gotten the
	binary distribution, gunzip it and dd it to the raw disk.  The binary
	distribution includes a disklabel and boot block, so you don't need
	to do anything special to make it bootable.  The binary distribution's
	file systems are created with an older version ("Level 1") of the
	Berkeley Fast File System format, so that you can mount, read, and
	write them under Digital UNIX.

	If you are using one of the supported systems that includes a
	PCI bus, and have either a PCI VGA frame buffer of any type or
	a ZLXp-E1 frame buffer, you may use it as console.  (If you
	are using your frame buffer as the console, you should use the
	terminal type 'sun'.)  Otherwise (if you are using a TurboChannel
	Alpha or have a different kind of frame buffer, you have to use
	a serial console.)
	
	Boot the Alpha with the OpenBSD disk, supplying the boot flag "-s".
	It should print something like "OpenBSD/Alpha Boot program", load
	the kernel, print a copyright, and print various startup messages.

	After a short while, you should be asked for the name of a shell
	to use; just hit return.  You're advised to fsck the disk at this
	point (the root partition is partition 'a' and the /usr partition
	is partition 'd'), remount the root partition read-write (use mount
	-u root-dev /), and create some necessary system information files:
		/etc/hosts
		/etc/resolv.conf
			DNS resolver configuration information, if you
			want to use DNS.
		/etc/myname
			The hostname of the machine.
		/etc/mygate
			The LAN's gateway's IP address, if your network
			setup requires that a static route to the
			gateway be created.
		/etc/hostname.xxy
			(where "xxy" is your machine's ethernet
			interface name, e.g. "le0" for TurboChannel
			machines or "de0" for PCI machines.)
			The IP address, etc., for the named network
			interface.  (You can have multiple of these
			files, for example, if the machine is
			multi-homed.)  The format can be discerned by
			looking in /etc/netstart, and is typically
			something like:
			    inet hostname.in.etc.hosts net.mask broadcast.addr
			where the netmask is formatted as a hex number
			(e.g. 0xffffff00), and the broadcast address
			is formatted as an IP address (e.g.  128.2.255.255)
		/etc/fstab
			The file system information table for the system.
			A prototype is in /etc/fstab.sd.
	(You can also create the files mentioned above by mounting the
	disk's file systems under Digital UNIX.)

	Once those files are created, you should be able to boot the system
	multi-user.  To do so, halt the system and boot again from the
	OpenBSD disk, this time supplying the boot flag "-a".

	If you used a disk other than an RZ25, you may want to edit the
	disk's disklabel, and create one or more partitions after the
	existing partitions to use the extra space.

	a bug.  Additionally, the SCSI driver seems unhappy about dealing

	Because I've been working on getting the system up and running, then
	out the door, I've not had much time to do performance analysis on
	the kernel, nor tried to improve performance in any way.  Some of
	the code is awfully rough.  That being said, on a lot of operations
	I'm seeing performance comparable to that of OSF/1 on the same
	hardware, so I've not gone too far wrong anywhere.

I'm pleased to (finally) announce the release of NetBSD/Alpha.

As some of you may know, NetBSD is a freely-available and freely-
redistributable BSD-derived system that runs on a variety of hardware
platforms, including i386's, Amigas, SPARCs, and DECstations.  The Alpha
port is unique, because it's the first port of NetBSD to a 64-bit
architecture.

The Alpha port of NetBSD is a true 64-bit port: pointers and longs are 64
bits.  This involved a _LOT_ of changes to "machine-independent" kernel,
and to many of the user-land programs.

So, some details on the status of the port, and a list of supported hardware:

	The port is self-hosting; it is stable enough to build all of its
	constituent binaries  (including GCC and the rest of the tool chain)
	many times over.  I've seen uptimes of more than a week, with
	multiple compiles going 24 hours a day.  It is in "production use"
	for its own development, and will soon be in use by computer science
	researchers.  It's _not_ simply a kernel hacker's toy at this point.

	Lots of things still don't work properly.  In particular, a lot of
	(poorly-written) user-land programs don't work.  As far as I'm
	aware, however, there are no found-but-yet-unfixed bugs in the
	libraries, which makes getting programs working a bit easier.
	Unfortunately, at this time, GDB isn't capable of actually debugging
	programs (though it is good for disassembling them, if you know
	where they crashed).  It's worth noting that the internet protocol
	suite works well (and, indeed, I do most of my work remotedly
	logged in), and the SunRPC library also works.  (Both required serious
	modifications to make them work with 64 bit pointers and longs.)
	Because formatting the manual pages would have required making g++
	and groff work, there are no formatted man pages included and
	there's no easy way to format them.  If you need the manual pages,
	I'd suggest that you look on another NetBSD system.  If you
	absolutely can't do that, OSF/1 manual pages should be OK for
	most tasks.

	There's rudimentary support for running OSF/1 binaries, which I
	originally used when bootstrapping the system.  However, it is only
	capable of running statically linked binaries, so it's not very
	useful except for bootstrapping.  It's hoped that eventually we'll
	be able to run dynamically-linked OSF/1 binaries.  (If you wish to
	work on this, please get in touch with me!)  NetBSD/Alpha can safely
	read and write OSF/1 (v2.0; I would guess v1.x and v3.x as well)
	file systems (assuming you don't have OSF/1's security features
	enabled).  Additionally, the NetBSD/Alpha disklabel format is
	compatible with OSF/1's.

	Supported hardware:
		DEC 3000/[456789]00 (I've only tested it on the 400 and
		600, but the rest should "just work) using the following
		peripherals:

			Serial ports -- barely; the serial driver needs a
				lot of help and is not useful for many
				complex tasks.
			LANCE ethernet -- only the on-board model; I've
				not tried any TurboChannel boards, and
				didn't write complete support for them into
				the driver.
			SCSI system -- it recognizes and can use both
				on-board SCSI controller chips.  However,
				it has trouble working with both at the
				same time.

			At this time neither the Smart Frame Buffer nor the
			ISDN/Audio interface is supported.

		DEC 3000/300 (with the same hardware supported as above;
		I've not tested these very much at all, on any of the
		3000/300 models.)

	Unfortunately, at this time none of the following systems are
	supported:
		AlphaPCs -- the EISA-bus Alpha systems
		AlphaStations -- the PCI-bus Alpha systems
		The Futurebus-based Alpha server systems
		The multiprocessor Alpha systems
d5 39
a43 19
	This release is being made in two parts, source and binary.  The
	source distribution is a gzipped tar file containing all of the
	sources used to build the system, including the compiler and
	user-land sources.  (Most of the kernel and user-land changes
	have made it back into the NetBSD source tree.  Many have not,
	however, and the compiler shipped with NetBSD doesn't work on
	the Alpha; if you're using NetBSD on the Alpha, you _need_ my
	source distribution.) The binary distribution is a gzipped disk
	image from an rz25 disk; it's approximately 406M ungzipped
	(63M gzipped), and you install it by dd'ing it on to a raw disk;
	more on this later.

	If you wish to obtain the source or binaries for the NetBSD/Alpha
	distribution, send me (cgd@@cs.cmu.edu) mail, and I'll arrange to
	get them to you.  They're sufficiently large that I've not yet
	found an FTP site for them, and also, given the preliminary nature
	of this distribution, I want to keep in close contact with
	the people who are using them.

			looking in /etc/netstart. As an example, for
			my development machine, it's:
d94 2
d116 8
a123 24
	A fair number of binaries don't work properly.  For example:
		GDB won't properly run programs or debug core files; someone
			needs to write support for NetBSD/Alpha.
		diff dumps core if there are differences in the files being
			compared (but it _doesn't_ dump core if they're the
			same!)
		ps and w don't work properly, for several reasons:
			(a) they don't know how to read an ECOFF binary's
				namelist, so can't find the addresses of
				things in core
			(b) I've thus far been lazy, and didn't bother
				creating some of the necessary entries in
				the device switches (e.g. /dev/drum),
				because I knew nothing could use them
				because of (a) anyway...

	As noted above, the SCSI code is reliable only when being used with
	one SCSI bus at a time; this is obviously a bug.  Additionally, the
	SCSI driver seems unhappy about dealing with certain types of disk
	drives (e.g. the IBM Lightning).  I don't know why these problems
	exist yet, but it's worth noting that somebody's in the process of
	rewriting the 53c94 chip support from the ground up because the
	current support is "somewhat lacking."  (This should solve at least
	the latter problem.)
a131 20
	I've run 'paranoia' on NetBSD/Alpha, and it reports one defect (the
	same result as for OSF/1).

Thanks to:
	Carnegie Mellon University, for funding for this project.
	Digital Equipment Corporation, for the hardware and documentation.
	Keith Bostic, for writing and/or working on a large chunk of the
		code, and for general moral corruption and good humor.
	Kirk McKusick, for being the Final Arbiter of Taste and Style.
	Jeff Mogul, for providing moral support, documentation, and
		pointers thereto.
	Various people working on NetBSD, for suggestions, sanity checking,
		drivers, etc.
	Whoever I'm forgetting, for things that I don't remember right now.


That's it for now; get in touch if you'd like to get copies of the software
and/or would like to contribute to the development effort.  I'll be sending
out status reports to various places (probably including the place(s) you
saw this announcement) as things progress.
