@Move files from common to dev to be more like other archs
(and so that tab completion on "compile" works as on other archs. :))

1.1
log
@Merge in big portions of the improvements NetBSD did to their alpha port.
Highlights: UVM, PMAP_NEW, bus_dma (only on some buses for now), new hardware
support, possiblity for ELF, etc, etc. Too much to mention.

This is still work in progress. video consoles might be broken, otherwise
we have basically the same functionality as before plus more.
