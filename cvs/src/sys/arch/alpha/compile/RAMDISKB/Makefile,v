1.1
log
@Kernel builds now happen in compile/CONFIG/obj@@ -> /usr/obj/... [or ./obj/,
if srctree is not rooted at /usr/src].  As a result, stock GENERIC & RAMDISK
kernels are commited to the tree, to ensure the src tree can be "readonly"
during builds, with all writes occuring inside the obj space.  config -b
options are handled by ../Makefile.inc.  The canonical new way to configure
one of these kernels is:
    % cd /sys/arch/amd64/compile/GENERIC.MP
    % doas make obj
    % make config
    % make
    % doas cp obj/bsd /bsd
The build infrastructure will use this new mechanism in a de-escalation
way using BUILDUSER.
Much help from natano and tb.
