@Also enclose variable names with external linkage in __BEGIN_DECLS.

Doesn't matter much since C++ ABI used by GCC doesn't mangle variable
names;  however technically is required by Section 7.5 of the C++ spec.

Discussed with/OK guenther@@, matthew@@.

1.1
log
@Implement C99 floating-point environment for Alpha.

Delivering FPE with non-masked exceptions doesn't work on Alpha; I
suspect there's a bug in the kernel trap handler.

FE_INEXACT is intentionally left out of FE_ALL_EXCEPT;  since the
inexact exception is not being maintained.  Otherwise it will lead
to the bogus results.
