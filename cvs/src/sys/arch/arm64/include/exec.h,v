@In exec_elf.c: expand ELFNAME(), ELFNAME2(), and ELFNAMEEND() except
leaving out the size, so that
	ELFNAME2(exec,makecmds)
becomes
	exec_elf_makecmds
instead of
	exec_elf{32,64}_makecmds
and then delete the ELFNAME2() and ELFNAMEEND() macros.

Move the prototypes for functions local to exec_elf.c to there from
exec_elf.h.

Simplify the SMALL_KERNEL conditionals around the ELF coredump code.

Change exec_conf.c to use the size-generic names and macros

Remove exec_elf{32,64}.c and just build exec_elf.c; delete the
_KERN_DO_ELF and _KERN_DO_ELF64 #defines.

ok jca@@, encouragement from deraadt@@ and tom@@
