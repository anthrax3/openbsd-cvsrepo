log
@Revise the definition of "struct reg" to have a layout compatible with other
operating systems.  Implement process_read_regs() and make
process_read_fpregs() clear the struct fpreg to avoid leaking kernel stack
contents.  This makes core dumps actually usable.

This commit contains all the kernel files related to the OpenBSD/arm64
port.  It is based on the PowerPC pmap, loongson, arm/armv7 code and
FreeBSD aarch64 code.  Hard work done by Dale Rahn.
