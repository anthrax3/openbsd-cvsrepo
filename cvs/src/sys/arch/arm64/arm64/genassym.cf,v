log
@Simplify ASID allocation code considerably by allocating an ASID up front
when a pmap is created and freeing it when the pmap is destroyed.  This
diff relies on the fill 16-bit ASID space being implemented in the processor.
While this is documented as an optional feature in the ARMv8 architecture
reference manual, all ARMv8 processors seen in the wild so far implement
the full 16-bit space.  This change incorporates changes by drahn@@ to
allocate an empty page table for the lower half of the address space for the
kernel.

ok drahn@@, patrick@@

@Fix asynchronous system traps so that they actually work.  Fixes at
least one regression test and allows processes to be killed using
Ctrl-C.  Discussed with Dale Rahn.

@Import of OpenBSD/arm64

This commit contains all the kernel files related to the OpenBSD/arm64
port.  It is based on the PowerPC pmap, loongson, arm/armv7 code and
FreeBSD aarch64 code.  Hard work done by Dale Rahn.
