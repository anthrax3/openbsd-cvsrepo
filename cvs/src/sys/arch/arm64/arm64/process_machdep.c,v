1.2
log
@Revise the definition of "struct reg" to have a layout compatible with other
operating systems.  Implement process_read_regs() and make
process_read_fpregs() clear the struct fpreg to avoid leaking kernel stack
contents.  This makes core dumps actually usable.

/*
 * This file may seem a bit stylized, but that so that it's easier to port.
 * Functions to be implemented here are:
 *
 * process_read_regs(proc, regs)
 *	Get the current user-visible register set from the process
 *	and copy it into the regs structure (<machine/reg.h>).
 *	The process is stopped at the time read_regs is called.
 *
 * process_write_regs(proc, regs)
 *	Update the current register set from the passed in regs
 *	structure.  Take care to avoid clobbering special CPU
 *	registers or privileged bits in the PSL.
 *	The process is stopped at the time write_regs is called.
 *
 * process_sstep(proc, sstep)
 *	Arrange for the process to trap or not trap depending on sstep
 *	after executing a single instruction.
 *
 * process_set_pc(proc)
 *	Set the process's program counter.

@Import of OpenBSD/arm64

This commit contains all the kernel files related to the OpenBSD/arm64
port.  It is based on the PowerPC pmap, loongson, arm/armv7 code and
FreeBSD aarch64 code.  Hard work done by Dale Rahn.
