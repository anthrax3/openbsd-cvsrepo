@Pass the address of the EFI system table and the EFI memory map through
properties in the /chosen node of the FDT.  The properties match the ones
used by Linux (see Documentation/arm/uefi.txt in the Linux kernel source
tree) but with the "linux," prefix replaced by "openbsd,".

log
@Pass the physical address to the end of symbols to the kernel.  From
armv7 we inherited the mechanism to manually modify the kernel symbol
table to change the value of esym.  We don't use this, but instead use
the virtual address that is passed to the kernel.  This change makes us
only work on and hand out physical addresses.  Bump the efiboot version
to make this ABI change more visible.
