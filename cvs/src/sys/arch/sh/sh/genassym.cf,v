@"Implement fast path TLB miss handling.  Walk the page table without
creating a trapframe, with exceptions disabled and using only BANK1
registers.  If a valid pte is found, load it and return.  Otherwise
create a trapframe and proceed to the full-blown C handler."

speed-ups measured by miod@@ and me were between 44% and 50%...

@First pass at removing clauses 3 and 4 from NetBSD licenses.

Not sure what's more surprising: how long it took for NetBSD to
catch up to the rest of the BSDs (including UCB), or the amount of
code that NetBSD has claimed for itself without attributing to the
actual authors.

@Make context switching much more MI:
 - Move the functionality of choosing a process from cpu_switch into
   a much simpler function: cpu_switchto. Instead of having the locore
   code walk the run queues, let the MI code choose the process we
   want to run and only implement the context switching itself in MD
   code.
 - Let MD context switching run without worrying about spls or locks.
 - Instead of having the idle loop implemented with special contexts
   in MD code, implement one idle proc for each cpu. make the idle
   loop MI with MD hooks.
 - Change the proc lists from the old style vax queues to TAILQs.
 - Change the sleep queue from vax queues to TAILQs. This makes
   wakeup() go from O(n^2) to O(n)

there will be some MD fallout, but it will be fixed shortly.
There's also a few cleanups to be done after this.

@Move landisk to hardware floating point. At the moment the FPU context is
always saved upon context switches, as FPU registers are heavily used for
long long computations (don't ask). Gcc default to -m4.

Credits to drahn@@ otto@@ and deraadt@@ for feedback and help testing.

Upgrade procedure if you don't want to use the damn snapshots:
- build and install new kernel, reboot off it
- build new gcc, do not install it yet
- make includes
- install new gcc
- build and install lib/csu and lib/libc
- make build
