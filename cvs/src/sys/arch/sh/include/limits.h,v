@We uniformly define size_t to be unsigned long and ssize_t to be long.  Make
sure that SIZE_MAX and SSIZE_MAX are defined as constants with a matching

@Move MB_LEN_MAX into the machine-independent sys/limits.h header,
rather than defining it separately for each architecture.
Also set it to 4, to accommodate for future UTF-8 support (rfc3629).

Diff by stsp, committing to catch the libc major bump
