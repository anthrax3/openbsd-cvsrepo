log
@Move landisk to hardware floating point. At the moment the FPU context is
always saved upon context switches, as FPU registers are heavily used for
long long computations (don't ask). Gcc default to -m4.

Credits to drahn@@ otto@@ and deraadt@@ for feedback and help testing.

Upgrade procedure if you don't want to use the damn snapshots:
- build and install new kernel, reboot off it
- build new gcc, do not install it yet
- make includes
- install new gcc
- build and install lib/csu and lib/libc
- make build
