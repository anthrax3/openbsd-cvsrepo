log
@emul_native is only used for kernel threads which can't dump core, so
delete coredump_trad(), uvm_coredump(), cpu_coredump(), struct md_coredump,
and various #includes that are superfluous.

This leaves compat_linux processes without a coredump callback.  If that
ability is desired, someone should update it to use coredump_elf32() and
verify the results...

@First pass at removing clauses 3 and 4 from NetBSD licenses.

Not sure what's more surprising: how long it took for NetBSD to
catch up to the rest of the BSDs (including UCB), or the amount of
code that NetBSD has claimed for itself without attributing to the
actual authors.

@Move landisk to hardware floating point. At the moment the FPU context is
always saved upon context switches, as FPU registers are heavily used for
long long computations (don't ask). Gcc default to -m4.

Credits to drahn@@ otto@@ and deraadt@@ for feedback and help testing.

Upgrade procedure if you don't want to use the damn snapshots:
- build and install new kernel, reboot off it
- build new gcc, do not install it yet
- make includes
- install new gcc
- build and install lib/csu and lib/libc
- make build
