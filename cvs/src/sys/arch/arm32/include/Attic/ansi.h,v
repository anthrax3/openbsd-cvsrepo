@We need to loose some weight.
If someone feels very opposed to this, the code is left in the Attic.
Just revive and _make_it_work_.

@Use an _BSD_FOO_T_ type declaration for off_t in machine/ansi.h to allow
off_t to be visible in stdio.h even in strict ansi mode.  This is needed
for ftello()/fseeko() and it allows us to remove the horrible fpos_t hack.
