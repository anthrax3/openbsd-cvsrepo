@We need to loose some weight.
If someone feels very opposed to this, the code is left in the Attic.
Just revive and _make_it_work_.

@Change the bounds_check_with_label API to also take a cpu_disklabel
reference for making transferral of meta-information possible from
readdisklabel to bounds_check_with_label.  The first (and maybe only)
thing that will use this is the multi-disklabel-format code on the
alpha where the labelsector is passed via cpu_disklabel so the label
write-protection can work correctly no matter what label was found.

Also use a new macro DKBAD to get at the dkbad field of the cpu_disklabel
implementations that contain it.  This too is for multi-disklabel
architectures where the "bad" field can be inside a union.  Use this
macro as a means for a driver to check if an architecture supports
dkbad constructs.

Remove proto of bounds_check_with_label from all MD disklabel.h as it
is in sys/disklabel.h.

I have not been able to test the changes everywhere, if I break anything
I apologize, and promise to fix it as soon as I become aware of it.

@Update the SMP branch to -current, this breaks the SMP branch though.
But it will be fixed soonish.  Note, nothing new has happened, this is just
a merge of the trunk into this branch.
