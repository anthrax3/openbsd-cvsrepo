@We need to loose some weight.
If someone feels very opposed to this, the code is left in the Attic.
Just revive and _make_it_work_.

@Use symbolic define for BYTE_ORDER.

(don't forget that cpp is `lazy':
#define A B
#define B value
#if A == value

works, since A isn't extended before it's needed, by which time B is known)

@Update the SMP branch to -current, this breaks the SMP branch though.
But it will be fixed soonish.  Note, nothing new has happened, this is just
a merge of the trunk into this branch.

@New endian.h design.  All architectures now use a common file for the bulk
part.  Some ports can optimize the swap operations.  This also means the
general API is extended with swap16, swap32, htobe16, htobe32, betoh16,
betoh32, htole16, htole32, letoh16 and letoh32.

@htons et al. works on explicit 16- and 32-bit quantities and not the
machine dependent "short" and "long" integer.  Correct and enhance manpage.
Change all short and longs to u_int16_t and u_int32_t, respectively.
