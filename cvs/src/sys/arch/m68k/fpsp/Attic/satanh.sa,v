@Retire hp300, mvme68k and mvme88k ports. These ports have no users, keeping
this hardware alive is becoming increasingly difficult, and I should heed the
message sent by the three disks which have died on me over the last few days.

Noone sane will mourn these ports anyway. So long, and thanks for the fish.

*
*	The entry point satanh computes the inverse
*	hyperbolic tangent of
*	an input argument; satanhd does the same except for denormalized
*	input.
*
*	Input: Double-extended number X in location pointed to
*		by address register a0.
*
*	Output: The value arctanh(X) returned in floating-point register Fp0.
*
*	Accuracy and Monotonicity: The returned result is within 3 ulps in
*		64 significant bit, i.e. within 0.5001 ulp to 53 bits if the
*		result is subsequently rounded to double precision. The 
*		result is provably monotonic in double precision.
*
*	Speed: The program satanh takes approximately 270 cycles.
*
*	Algorithm:
*
*	ATANH
*	1. If |X| >= 1, go to 3.
*
*	2. (|X| < 1) Calculate atanh(X) by
*		sgn := sign(X)
*		y := |X|
*		z := 2y/(1-y)
*		atanh(X) := sgn * (1/2) * logp1(z)
*		Exit.
*
*	3. If |X| > 1, go to 5.
*
*	4. (|X| = 1) Generate infinity with an appropriate sign and
*		divide-by-zero by	
*		sgn := sign(X)
*		atan(X) := sgn / (+0).
*		Exit.
*
*	5. (|X| > 1) Generate an invalid operation by 0 * infinity.
*		Exit.
