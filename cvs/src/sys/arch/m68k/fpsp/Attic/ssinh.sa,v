@Retire hp300, mvme68k and mvme88k ports. These ports have no users, keeping
this hardware alive is becoming increasingly difficult, and I should heed the
message sent by the three disks which have died on me over the last few days.

Noone sane will mourn these ports anyway. So long, and thanks for the fish.

*
*       The entry point sSinh computes the hyperbolic sine of
*       an input argument; sSinhd does the same except for denormalized
*       input.
*
*       Input: Double-extended number X in location pointed to 
*		by address register a0.
*
*       Output: The value sinh(X) returned in floating-point register Fp0.
*
*       Accuracy and Monotonicity: The returned result is within 3 ulps in
*               64 significant bit, i.e. within 0.5001 ulp to 53 bits if the
*               result is subsequently rounded to double precision. The
*               result is provably monotonic in double precision.
*
*       Speed: The program sSINH takes approximately 280 cycles.
*
*       Algorithm:
*
*       SINH
*       1. If |X| > 16380 log2, go to 3.
*
*       2. (|X| <= 16380 log2) Sinh(X) is obtained by the formulae
*               y = |X|, sgn = sign(X), and z = expm1(Y),
*               sinh(X) = sgn*(1/2)*( z + z/(1+z) ).
*          Exit.
*
*       3. If |X| > 16480 log2, go to 5.
*
*       4. (16380 log2 < |X| <= 16480 log2)
*               sinh(X) = sign(X) * exp(|X|)/2.
*          However, invoking exp(|X|) may cause premature overflow.
*          Thus, we calculate sinh(X) as follows:
*             Y       := |X|
*             sgn     := sign(X)
*             sgnFact := sgn * 2**(16380)
*             Y'      := Y - 16381 log2
*             sinh(X) := sgnFact * exp(Y').
*          Exit.
*
*       5. (|X| > 16480 log2) sinh(X) must overflow. Return
*          sign(X)*Huge*Huge to generate overflow and an infinity with
*          the appropriate sign. Huge is the largest finite number in
*          extended format. Exit.
