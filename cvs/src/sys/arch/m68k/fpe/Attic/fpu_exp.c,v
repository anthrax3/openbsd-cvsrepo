@Sync m68k fpe code with NetBSD; but remove unimplemented opcodes stubs, so
that we trigger SIGILL instead of propagating false results.

Tested by martin@@ on Macintosh LCIII.

1.1
log
@from netbsd:
Still incomplete, but much more complete FPE from Ken Nakata
<kenn@@remus.rutgers.edu>.  This emulator does not yet emulate
the following functions:
        FSINH, FETOXM1, FTANH, FATAN, FASIN, FATANH, FSIN, FTAN,
        FETOX, FTWOTOX, FTENTOX, FCOSH, FACOS, FCOS, FSINCOS
It is sufficient, however, to allow programs like df, w, and newfs,
to run to completion with correct results.
Portions of this code were based on the sparc fpe and on initial
work by gwr.
