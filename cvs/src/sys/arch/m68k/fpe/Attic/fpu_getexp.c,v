@Remove the m68k FPU emulator; it was only used by the mac68k port which has been
lying in the Attic for quite awhile; none of the remaining m68k-based ports
support FPU-less systems; assuming my HP332 cpu board is in working condition,
give me memory boards for it to have at least 8MB and a chassis, and I'll
consider bringing this code back. But then, the 332 has an FPU socket, and
I'd rather write a new glue to use the MI softloat code (bug-free) than try
and fix the bugs in this.

@from netbsd:
Still incomplete, but much more complete FPE from Ken Nakata
<kenn@@remus.rutgers.edu>.  This emulator does not yet emulate
the following functions:
        FSINH, FETOXM1, FTANH, FATAN, FASIN, FATANH, FSIN, FTAN,
        FETOX, FTWOTOX, FTENTOX, FCOSH, FACOS, FCOS, FSINCOS
It is sufficient, however, to allow programs like df, w, and newfs,
to run to completion with correct results.
Portions of this code were based on the sparc fpe and on initial
work by gwr.
