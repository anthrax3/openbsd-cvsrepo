@Retire hp300, mvme68k and mvme88k ports. These ports have no users, keeping
this hardware alive is becoming increasingly difficult, and I should heed the
message sent by the three disks which have died on me over the last few days.

Noone sane will mourn these ports anyway. So long, and thanks for the fish.

@Kernel bits for m68k/ELF, mostly from NetBSD. In addition, the `pmod' symbel
in fpsp has to be renamed due to a clash with other parts of the kernel.

@Sync with NetBSD changes, 970415 - 970705.

This includes a new asm.h, as well as even more code abstracted from hp300.
These changes are likely to break ports that don't know about them; hp300
runs at the moment.
