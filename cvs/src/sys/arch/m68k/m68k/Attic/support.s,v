log
@Retire hp300, mvme68k and mvme88k ports. These ports have no users, keeping
this hardware alive is becoming increasingly difficult, and I should heed the
message sent by the three disks which have died on me over the last few days.

Noone sane will mourn these ports anyway. So long, and thanks for the fish.

log
@Merge changes from NetBSD, 3/19/97; enforce use of new files in file.m68k.

All of the m68k ports need fixing, in various ways.  From a casual look,
mvme68k and sun3 need the most work.

Tested on hp300, from which sig_machdep.c is based.
