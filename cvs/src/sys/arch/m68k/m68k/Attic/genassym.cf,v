@Retire hp300, mvme68k and mvme88k ports. These ports have no users, keeping
this hardware alive is becoming increasingly difficult, and I should heed the
message sent by the three disks which have died on me over the last few days.

Noone sane will mourn these ports anyway. So long, and thanks for the fish.

@Drop support for the HP MMU. It was only found on two hp300 systems (models
320 and 350), which have been unsupported since a bunch of release already,
because this annoying MMU does not have TT registers (or if it does, it is
not documented) and thus went in the way of PMAP_DIRECT for hp300.
In other words: remove a bunch of code which was either #ifdef'ed out or
had no chance to run in real life.

1.13
log
@Make context switching much more MI:
 - Move the functionality of choosing a process from cpu_switch into
   a much simpler function: cpu_switchto. Instead of having the locore
   code walk the run queues, let the MI code choose the process we
   want to run and only implement the context switching itself in MD
   code.
 - Let MD context switching run without worrying about spls or locks.
 - Instead of having the idle loop implemented with special contexts
   in MD code, implement one idle proc for each cpu. make the idle
   loop MI with MD hooks.
 - Change the proc lists from the old style vax queues to TAILQs.
 - Change the sleep queue from vax queues to TAILQs. This makes
   wakeup() go from O(n^2) to O(n)

there will be some MD fallout, but it will be fixed shortly.
There's also a few cleanups to be done after this.
