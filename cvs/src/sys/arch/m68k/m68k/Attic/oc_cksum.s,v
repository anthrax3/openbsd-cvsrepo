@Retire hp300, mvme68k and mvme88k ports. These ports have no users, keeping
this hardware alive is becoming increasingly difficult, and I should heed the
message sent by the three disks which have died on me over the last few days.

Noone sane will mourn these ports anyway. So long, and thanks for the fish.

|
| oc_cksum: ones complement 16 bit checksum for MC68020.
|
| oc_cksum (buffer, count, strtval)
|
| Do a 16 bit one's complement sum of 'count' bytes from 'buffer'.
| 'strtval' is the starting value of the sum (usually zero).
|
| It simplifies life in in_cksum if strtval can be >= 2^16.
| This routine will work as long as strtval is < 2^31.
|
| Performance
| -----------
| This routine is intended for MC 68020s but should also work
| for 68030s.  It (deliberately) doesn't worry about the alignment
| of the buffer so will only work on a 68010 if the buffer is
| aligned on an even address.  (Also, a routine written to use
| 68010 "loop mode" would almost certainly be faster than this
| code on a 68010).
|
| We don't worry about alignment because this routine is frequently
| called with small counts: 20 bytes for IP header checksums and 40
| bytes for TCP ack checksums.  For these small counts, testing for
| bad alignment adds ~10% to the per-call cost.  Since, by the nature
| of the kernel's allocator, the data we're called with is almost
| always longword aligned, there is no benefit to this added cost
| and we're better off letting the loop take a big performance hit
| in the rare cases where we're handed an unaligned buffer.
|
| Loop unrolling constants of 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 and 64 times were
| tested on random data on four different types of processors (see
| list below -- 64 was the largest unrolling because anything more
| overflows the 68020 Icache).  On all the processors, the
| throughput asymptote was located between 8 and 16 (closer to 8).
| However, 16 was substantially better than 8 for small counts.
| (It's clear why this happens for a count of 40: unroll-8 pays a
| loop branch cost and unroll-16 doesn't.  But the tests also showed
| that 16 was better than 8 for a count of 20.  It's not obvious to
| me why.)  So, since 16 was good for both large and small counts,
| the loop below is unrolled 16 times.
| 
| The processors tested and their average time to checksum 1024 bytes
| of random data were:
| 	Sun 3/50 (15MHz)	190 us/KB
| 	Sun 3/180 (16.6MHz)	175 us/KB
| 	Sun 3/60 (20MHz)	134 us/KB
| 	Sun 3/280 (25MHz)	 95 us/KB
| 
| The cost of calling this routine was typically 10% of the per-
| kilobyte cost.  E.g., checksumming zero bytes on a 3/60 cost 9us
| and each additional byte cost 125ns.  With the high fixed cost,
| it would clearly be a gain to "inline" this routine -- the
| subroutine call adds 400% overhead to an IP header checksum.
| However, in absolute terms, inlining would only gain 10us per
| packet -- a 1% effect for a 1ms ethernet packet.  This is not
| enough gain to be worth the effort.
