@Retire hp300, mvme68k and mvme88k ports. These ports have no users, keeping
this hardware alive is becoming increasingly difficult, and I should heed the
message sent by the three disks which have died on me over the last few days.

Noone sane will mourn these ports anyway. So long, and thanks for the fish.

@Do not expose the trap T_* values to userland, since they invade the
namespace a bit much.  These are the names for the value encoded in
core.c_ucode or siginfo.si_trapno, but userland never looks directly
and only cares about the abstract signal code.

@Determine whether we're currently on the alternative signal stack
dynamically, by comparing the stack pointer against the altstack
base and size, so that you get the correct answer if you longjmp
out of the signal handler, as tested by regress/sys/kern/stackjmp/.
Also, fix alt stack handling on vax, where it was completely broken.
