@remove hppa64 port, which we never got going beyond broken single users.
hppa reverse-stack gives us a valuable test case, but most developers don't
have a 2nd one to proceed further with this.

 * The PDC provides access to Non-Volatile Memory (NVM).  If this
 * is implemented (it's HVERSION dependent), the first 256 bytes
 * are formatted as follows:
 *
 *	0x000	+----------------------------+
 *		| Implementation information |
 *	0x024	+----------------------------+
 *		|                            |
 *		|      IPL information       |
 *		|                            |
 *	0x080	+----------------------------+

 *		|                            |
 *		|    OS Panic information    |

 *	0x100	+----------------------------+
 *
 * It appears that there are at least 256 bytes of NVM, and only
 * the "OS Panic information" is not architected.  This means that
 * we can use locations 0x80 - 0xFF for saving information across
 * boots (e.g. boot flags and boot device).  I think we should use
 * the higher portions of this space first, to avoid conflicting
 * with possible future HP-PA plans for the NVM.
 *
 * The PDC requires that NVM be read/written to in word multiples.
