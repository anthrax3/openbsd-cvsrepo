@remove hppa64 port, which we never got going beyond broken single users.
hppa reverse-stack gives us a valuable test case, but most developers don't
have a 2nd one to proceed further with this.

log
@First pass at removing clauses 3 and 4 from NetBSD licenses.

code that NetBSD has claimed for itself without attributing to the
actual authors.

OK deraadt@@
