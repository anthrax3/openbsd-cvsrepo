.Dt BOOT 8 hppa
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm boot ,
.Nm boot.conf
.Nd hppa-specific bootstrap
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The main purpose of this program is to load the system kernel while dealing
with the various features of the PA-RISC hardware.
.Pp
As described in
.Xr boot_hppa 8 ,
this program is loaded by the PDC firmware
and provides a convenient way to load the kernel.
.Pp
Basic operations include:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
Loading kernels from any device supported by your system.
.It
Loading kernels compressed by
.Xr gzip 1 .
.It
Providing an interactive command line.
.It
Detecting and switching between multiple consoles.
.El
.Pp
The sequence of its operation is as follows: initialization,
parsing the configuration file, then an interactive command line.
While at the command line you have 5 seconds to type any commands, if needed.
If time expires, the kernel will be loaded according to
the current variable settings (see the
.Nm set
command).
Each time a kernel load fails, the timeout is increased by one second.
The sequence of
.Nm
operations is as follows:
.Bl -enum
.It
If the file
.Pa /etc/boot.conf
exists on the filesystem or LIF image
.Nm
was loaded from, open and parse it.
Lines beginning with the
.Sq #
character,
as well as whitespace at the beginning of lines,
are ignored.
The file may contain any commands
.Nm
accepts at the interactive prompt.
Though default settings usually suffice, they can be changed here.
.It
The header line
.Pp
.Dl >> OpenBSD/hppa BOOT [x.xx]
.Pp
is displayed to the active console, where
.Ar x.xx
is the version number of the
.Nm
program, followed by the
.Pp
.Dl boot>
.Pp
prompt, which means you are in interactive mode and may enter commands.
If you do not,
.Nm
will proceed to load the kernel with the current parameters after the
timeout period has expired.
.El
.Pp
By default,
.Nm
attempts to load the kernel executable
.Pa /bsd .
If it fails to find the kernel and no alternative kernel image has
been specified, the system will be unable to boot.
.Sh COMMANDS
The following commands are accepted at the
.Nm
prompt:
.Bl -tag -width shorten
.It boot Oo Oo Ar device : Oc Ns Ar image Oc Op Fl acds
Boots the specified kernel image
with any options given.
If
.Ar device
or
.Ar image
are omitted, values from
.Nm
variables will be used.
.Bl -tag -width _a_
.It Fl a
Causes the kernel to ask for the
.Nm root
device to use.
.It Fl c
Causes the kernel to go into
.Xr boot_config 8
before performing
.Xr autoconf 4
procedures.
.It Fl d
Causes the kernel to drop into
.Xr ddb 4
at the earliest convenient point.
.It Fl s
Causes the kernel to boot single-user.
.El
.It echo Op Ar args
Displays
.Ar args
on the console device.
.It help
Prints a list of available commands and machine dependent
commands, if any.
.It machine Op Ar command
Issues machine-dependent commands.
These are defined for hppa architecture:
.Bl -tag -width keyboard
.It Nm console
Displays or sets the console path.
.Pp
When invoked with no argument, this command will display the configured
console path found in the stable storage area.
.Pp
Otherwise, the argument will be interpreted as a console path
definition string, and
.Nm
will attempt to switch the console configuration to the desired device.
The console definition attempts to follow the PDC syntax,
and would have a form of:
.Bd -filled
graphics
.Op _head
.Op .mode
.Ed
for graphics console, and
.Bd -filled
rs232
.Op _2
.Op .speed Op .bits Op .parity
.Ed
for serial console.
.Pp
The default head and mode for graphics console are 0, that is the default
videomode of the first graphics device.
The default serial settings are 9600 bps, 8 data bits, and no parity.
.It Nm keyboard
Displays or sets the keyboard path.
.Pp
When invoked with no argument, this command will display the configured
keyboard path found in the stable storage area.
.Pp
Otherwise, the argument will be interpreted as a keyboard path definition
string, and
.Nm
will attempt to switch the keyboard configuration to the desired port.
The keyboard definition attempts to follow the PDC syntax,
and would have a form of:
.Bd -filled
hil
.Ed
for hil keyboard, and
.Bd -filled
ps2
.Ed
for PS/2 keyboard.
.El
.Pp
After changing any path settings, the machine usually has to be restarted for
the changes to have effect.
.It ls Op Ar directory
Prints contents of the specified
.Ar directory
in long format including: attributes and file type, owner, group,
size, filename.
.It reboot
Reboots the machine by initiating a warm boot procedure.
.It set Op Ar varname Op Ar value
If invoked without arguments, prints a list of variables and their values.
If only
.Ar varname
is specified, displays contents of that variable.
If
.Ar varname
and
.Ar value
are both specified, sets that variable to the given value.
Variables include:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -compact -width boothow
.It Nm addr
Address at which to load the kernel.
.It Nm debug
Debug flag if
.Nm
was compiled with DEBUG defined.
.It Nm device
Boot device name (i.e.,
.Li lf0a ,
.Li sd0a ) .
.It Nm howto
Options to pass to the loaded kernel.
.It Nm image
File name containing the kernel image.
.It Nm timeout
Number of seconds boot will wait for human intervention before
booting the default kernel image.
.\" .It Nm tty
.\" Active console device name (i.e.,
.\" .Li ttya ,
.\" .Li ttyb ,
.\" .Li ite0) .
.El
.\" .It stty Op Ar device Op Ar speed
.\" Displays or sets the
.\" .Ar speed
.\" for a console
.\" .Ar device .
.\" If changing the baudrate for the currently active console,
.\" .Nm
.\" offers you five seconds of grace time before committing the change
.\" to allow you to change your terminal's speed to match.
.\" If changing speed
.\" .Em not
.\" for the active console, the baudrate is set for the
.\" .Em next
.\" time you switch to a serial console.
.\" The baudrate value is not used for the
.\" .Li ite0
.\" console.
.\" .Pp
.\" The default baudrate is 9600bps.
.It time
Displays system time and date.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /etc/boot.conf -compact
.It Pa /boot
system bootstrap
.It Pa /etc/boot.conf
system bootstrap's startup file
.It Pa /bsd
kernel image
.It Pa /bsd.rd
kernel image for installation/recovery
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
Boot the default kernel:
.Pp
.Dl boot> boot
.Pp
Remove the 5 second pause at boot-time permanently, causing
.Nm
to load the kernel immediately without prompting:
.Pp
.Dl # echo \&"boot\&" > /etc/boot.conf
.Pp
Use serial console on the first serial port, with the usual 9600 8N1 settings.
A null modem cable should connect the specified serial port to a terminal.
Useful for debugging.
.Pp
.Dl boot> machine console rs232.9600.8.none
.Pp
Boot the kernel named
.Pa /bsd
from the second SCSI disk in
.Dq User Kernel Configuration
mode (see
.Xr boot_config 8 ) .
This mechanism allows for the explicit enabling and disabling of devices
during the current boot sequence, as well as the modification
of device parameters.
Once booted, such changes can be made permanent by using
.Xr config 8 Ns 's
.Fl e
option.
.Pp
.Dl boot> boot sd1a:/bsd -c

.Sh HISTORY
This program was written by Michael Shalayeff for
.Ox 2.1 .
The hppa specific parts were written by Michael Shalayeff and Miodrag Vallat
for
.Ox 3.1 .
.Sh CAVEATS
Making mistakes in console paths may cost you a toupee.
.Sh BUGS
Changing the display resolution (mode) on a graphics console does not work
correctly.

.Dt BOOT 8 hppa
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm boot ,
.Nm boot.conf
.Nd
hppa-specific bootstrap
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The main purpose of this program is to load the system kernel while dealing
with the various features of the PA-RISC hardware.
.Pp
.\" As described in
.\" .Xr boot_hppa 8 ,
.\" this program is loaded by the PDC firmware
This program is loaded by the PDC firmware
and provides a convenient way to load the kernel.
.Pp
Basic operations include:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
Loading kernels from any device supported by your system.
.It
Loading kernels compressed by
.Xr gzip 1 .
.It
Providing an interactive command line.
.It
Detecting and switching between multiple consoles.
.El
.Pp
The sequence of its operation is as follows: initialization,
parsing the configuration file, then an interactive command line.
While at the command line you have 5 seconds to type any commands, if needed.
If time expires, the kernel will be loaded according to
the current variable settings (see the
.Nm set
command).
Each time a kernel load fails, the timeout is increased by one second.
The sequence of
.Nm
operations is as follows:
.Bl -enum
.It
If the file
.Pa /etc/boot.conf
exists on the filesystem or LIF image
.Nm
was loaded from, open and parse it.
This file may contain any commands
.Nm
accepts at the interactive prompt.
Though default settings usually suffice, they can be changed here.
.It
The header line
.Pp
.Dl >> OpenBSD/hppa BOOT [x.xx]
.Pp
is displayed to the active console, where
.Ar x.xx
is the version number of the
.Nm
program, followed by the
.Pp
.Dl boot>
.Pp
prompt, which means you are in the interactive mode and may enter commands.
If you do not,
.Nm
will proceed to loading the kernel with the current parameters after the
timeout period has expired.
.El
.Sh COMMANDS
The following commands are accepted at the
.Nm
prompt:
.Bl -tag -width shorten
.It boot Op Ar image Op Fl acds
Boots the kernel image specified by
.Ar image
with any options given.
Image specification consists of a pair
.Em device : filename ,
either or both can be omitted (':' is not needed if both are omitted),
in which case values from
.Nm
variables will be used.
.Bl -tag -width _a_
.It Fl a
Causes the kernel to ask for the
.Nm root
device to use.
.It Fl c
Causes the kernel to go into
.Xr boot_config 8
before performing
.Xr autoconf 4
procedures.
.It Fl d
Causes the kernel to drop into
.Xr ddb 4
at the earliest convinient point.
.It Fl s
Causes the kernel to boot single-user.
.El
.It echo Op Ar args
Displays
.Ar args
on the console device.
.It help
Prints a list of available commands and machine dependent
commands, if any.
.It machine Op Ar command
Issues machine-dependent commands.
These are defined for hppa architecture:
.Bl -tag -width keyboard
.It Nm console
Displays or sets the console path.
.Pp
When invoked with no argument, this command will display the configured
console path found in the stable storage area.
.Pp
Otherwise, the argument will be interpreted as a console path
definition string, and
.Nm
will attempt to switch the console configuration to the desired device.
The console definition attempts to follow the PDC syntax,
and would have a form of:
.Pp
.Bd -offset indent -compact
graphics
.Op _head
.Op .mode
.Ed
for graphics console, and
.Pp
.Bd -offset indent -compact
rs232
.Op _2
.Op .speed Op .bits Op .parity
.Ed
for serial console.
.Pp
The default head and mode for graphics console are 0, that is the default
videomode of the first graphics device.
The default serial settings are 9600 bps, 8 data bits, and no parity.
.It Nm keyboard
Displays or sets the keyboard path.
.Pp
When invoked with no argument, this command will display the configured
keyboard path found in the stable storage area.
.Pp
Otherwise, the argument will be interpreted as a keyboard path definition
string, and
.Nm
will attempt to switch the keyboard configuration to the desired port.
The keyboard definition attempts to follow the PDC syntax,
and would have a form of:
.Pp
.Bd -offset indent -compact
hil
.Ed
for hil keyboard, and
.Pp
.Bd -offset indent -compact
ps2
.Ed
for PS/2 keyboard.
.El
.Pp
After changing any path settings, the machine usually has to be restarted for
the changes to have effect.
.It ls Op Ar directory
Prints contents of the specified
.Ar directory
in long format including: attributes and file type, owner, group,
size, filename.
.It reboot
Reboots the machine by initiating a warm boot procedure.
.It set Op Ar varname Op Ar value
If invoked without arguments, prints a list of variables and their values.
If only
.Ar varname
is specified, displays contents of that variable.
If
.Ar varname
and
.Ar value
are both specified, sets that variable to the given value.
Variables include:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -compact -width boothow
.It Nm addr
Address at which to load the kernel.
.It Nm debug
Debug flag if
.Nm
was compiled with DEBUG defined.
.It Nm device
Boot device name (i.e.,
.Li lf0a ,
.Li sd0a ) .
.It Nm howto
Options to pass to the loaded kernel.
.It Nm image
File name containing the kernel image.
.It Nm timeout
Number of seconds boot will wait for human intervention before
booting the default kernel image.
.\" .It Nm tty
.\" Active console device name (i.e.,
.\" .Li ttya ,
.\" .Li ttyb ,
.\" .Li ite0) .
.El
.\" .It stty Op Ar device Op Ar speed
.\" Displays or sets the
.\" .Ar speed
.\" for a console
.\" .Ar device .
.\" If changing the baudrate for the currently active console,
.\" .Nm
.\" offers you five seconds of grace time before committing the change
.\" to allow you to change your terminal's speed to match.
.\" If changing speed
.\" .Em not
.\" for the active console, the baudrate is set for the
.\" .Em next
.\" time you switch to a serial console.
.\" The baudrate value is not used for the
.\" .Li ite0
.\" console.
.\" .Pp
.\" The default baudrate is 9600bps.
.It time
Displays system time and date.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Li boot> boot
.Pp
Boot the default kernel.
.Pp
.Li # echo \&"boot\&" > /etc/boot.conf
.Pp
Remove the 5 second pause at boot-time permanently, causing
.Nm
to load the kernel immediately without prompting.
.Pp
.Li boot> machine console rs232.9600.8.none
.Pp
Use serial console on the first serial port, with the usual 9600 8N1 settings.
A null modem cable should connect the specified serial port to a terminal.
Useful for debugging.
.Pp
.Li boot> boot sd1a:/bsd -c
.Pp
Boot the kernel named
.Pa /bsd
from the second SCSI disk in
.Dq User Kernel Configuration
mode (see
.Xr boot_config 8 ) .
This mechanism allows for the explicit enabling and disabling of devices
during the current boot sequence, as well as the modification
of device parameters.
Once booted, such changes can be made permanent by using
.Xr config 8 Ns 's
.Fl e
option.

By default,
.Nm
attempts to load the kernel executable
.Pa /bsd .
If that fails, it will attempt to load
.Pa /obsd

.Pa /bsd.old .
