@Currently pdc_scanbus() scans in reverse, which results in physical CPU0
attaching as cpu1 and physical CPU1 attaching as cpu0. Split the device
scan into two parts - the first pass scans forward and attaches memory
and CPUs, whilst the second pass scans in reverse attaching the
remaining devices, thus preserving current semantics.

Found the hard way whilst trying to spin up the secondary CPU on my j6750.

@newer machines use phantom bus to attach lasi and other bus adapters.
oledr machines did not have a real device for the phantom bus port.
change the device scanning technique to both include a full device path
in the attach_args and do proper shifting in the pdc_scanbus() and
add a device for the newer machines as well as use a newer device
mapping (path to hpa) available on newer firmware versions, where
old (hversion-dependant) is not available.
