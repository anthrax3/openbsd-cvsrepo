@Allow MD oosiop(4) attachment to override default values for a few of the
chip initialization values (SCNTL0, DMODE, DWT, CTEST7).
No functional change on hppa; required by another upcoming attachment.

log
@Preliminary port of NetBSD oosiop driver, for NCR53C700 chips, as commonly
encountered on the oldest hppa machines.

Currently compiled in, but disabled, in the kernel, until it is stable
enough - right now read access are fine, but writes eventually time out
and do not complete.
