@Implement pckbc_xt_translation() in gsckbc. Thus, we can attach pckbd instead of
gsckbd; the former will cause a proper translation page to be selected by
the keyboard.

Because of this, we no longer depend on the page the keyboard is left in
by the PDC (page 2 for all machines but the PrecisionBook, which is in
page 3), and there is no longer any need to use separate keyboard maps.

@Although some hppa models, such as the 715, will require specific keyboards,
some others, like the 712, will run with a regular ps/2 keyboard from your
average computer shop, and the hardware will convert the scancodes so that
they match the braindead gsc usage.

Thus, it makes no point carrying a specific set of keyboard layouts for gsckbd,
when in fact it's (almost) the same as for pckbd, with scancodes shuffled.

So, add a simple scheme to build gsckbd tables from the pckbd tables. This
brings all the international layouts from pckbd, but jp and br have extra
keys for which I don't know the scancodes, so the generated gsckbd layouts
are incomplete.
