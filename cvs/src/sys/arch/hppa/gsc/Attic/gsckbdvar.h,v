@Implement pckbc_xt_translation() in gsckbc. Thus, we can attach pckbd instead of
gsckbd; the former will cause a proper translation page to be selected by
the keyboard.

Because of this, we no longer depend on the page the keyboard is left in
by the PDC (page 2 for all machines but the PrecisionBook, which is in
page 3), and there is no longer any need to use separate keyboard maps.

1.1
log
@Enter gsckbc, a driver for the ps/2-like input device ports found on many
hppa machines, and gsckbd, a driver for the ps/2-like keyboard.

Both are derived from pckbc and pckbd, but the differences in port wiring and
keyboard behaviour prevented the creation of a thin pckbc wrapper.

Currently, only us and uk keyboard layouts are provided.

The adventurous person can enable gsckb[cd], wsdisplay at sti and wskbd,
but this will only work correctly on machines featuring a modern-prom sti
graphics device, and a ps/2 keyboard port.
