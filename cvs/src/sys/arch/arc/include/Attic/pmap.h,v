@We need to loose some weight.
If someone feels very opposed to this, the code is left in the Attic.

@Update the SMP branch to -current, this breaks the SMP branch though.
But it will be fixed soonish.  Note, nothing new has happened, this is just
a merge of the trunk into this branch.

 *	USRDATA		USRTEXT + text_size

 *
 * The user address space is mapped using a two level structure where

 * Bits 21..12 are then used to index a PTE which describes a page within

 * The wired entries in the TLB will contain the following:
 *	0-1	(UPAGES)	for curproc user struct and kernel stack.
 *
 * Note: The kernel doesn't use the same data structures as user programs.
 * All the PTE entries are stored in a single array in Sysmap which is

@Next try. ARC tree import. "New" Mips (spim) ARC compliant systems tree.
This tree will eventually suport viritualy all ARC compliant Mips systems,
that is all we can lay our hands on for porting/testing. It will supersede
the pica tree which will be removed shortly when this tree is functioning.
