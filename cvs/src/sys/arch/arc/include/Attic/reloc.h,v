@We need to loose some weight.
If someone feels very opposed to this, the code is left in the Attic.
Just revive and _make_it_work_.

@Update the SMP branch to -current, this breaks the SMP branch though.
But it will be fixed soonish.  Note, nothing new has happened, this is just
a merge of the trunk into this branch.

@Cleanup, endian and abi stuff fixies. Some stuff added for MIPS Magnum.

@Next try. ARC tree import. "New" Mips (spim) ARC compliant systems tree.
This tree will eventually suport viritualy all ARC compliant Mips systems,
that is all we can lay our hands on for porting/testing. It will supersede
the pica tree which will be removed shortly when this tree is functioning.
