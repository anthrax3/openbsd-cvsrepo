@We need to loose some weight.
If someone feels very opposed to this, the code is left in the Attic.
Just revive and _make_it_work_.

@To do list (not in any particular order).

    o	Improve pmap_zero_page and pmap_copy_page. Speed and flushing.

    o	Move the RO and WIRED attribute from the pte to the pv table.
	This saves four instructions in the tlb miss handler.
InWork: Have a test version. The system hangs after a while. Not solved yet.
        Also, is it worth the effort to remove 4 instr. in TLB-miss handler?

    o   Boot. Standalone boot program instead of booting the kernel directly?

    o   Find out why bitmap load to S3-928 flashes screen. (X server)
Know why (enable linear mode). Need S3 info.

    o   Can we have 32 double registers?

    o	New dynamic loader...


Lots of other things.....

@Update the SMP branch to -current, this breaks the SMP branch though.
But it will be fixed soonish.  Note, nothing new has happened, this is just
a merge of the trunk into this branch.

    o   sigsetjmp/siglongjmp missing....

    o   Add more videomodes to pccons driver. 50kHz and 64kHz monitors?
InWork: This seems to be hard. Need more info on the chip.

@Next try. ARC tree import. "New" Mips (spim) ARC compliant systems tree.
This tree will eventually suport viritualy all ARC compliant Mips systems,
that is all we can lay our hands on for porting/testing. It will supersede
the pica tree which will be removed shortly when this tree is functioning.
