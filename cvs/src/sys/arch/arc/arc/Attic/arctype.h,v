@Addition of support for a PCI based Vr4300 board from Algorithmics, the P-4032.
Changes to io macros were done to handle sparse bus addressing dynamically.
This is a first cut (rough).

log
@Next try. ARC tree import. "New" Mips (spim) ARC compliant systems tree.
This tree will eventually suport viritualy all ARC compliant Mips systems,
that is all we can lay our hands on for porting/testing. It will supersede
the pica tree which will be removed shortly when this tree is functioning.
