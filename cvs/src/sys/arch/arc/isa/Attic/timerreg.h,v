@We need to loose some weight.
If someone feels very opposed to this, the code is left in the Attic.
Just revive and _make_it_work_.

 * Register definitions for the Intel 8253 Programmable Interval Timer.
 *
 * This chip has three independent 16-bit down counters that can be
 * read on the fly.  There are three mode registers and three countdown
 * registers.  The countdown registers are addressed directly, via the
 * first three I/O ports.  The three mode registers are accessed via
 * the fourth I/O port, with two bits in the mode byte indicating the
 * register.  (Why are hardware interfaces always so braindead?).
 *
 * To write a value into the countdown register, the mode register
 * is first programmed with a command indicating the which byte of
 * the two byte register is to be modified.  The three possibilities
 * are load msb (TMR_MR_MSB), load lsb (TMR_MR_LSB), or load lsb then
 * msb (TMR_MR_BOTH).
 *
 * To read the current value ("on the fly") from the countdown register,
 * you write a "latch" command into the mode register, then read the stable
 * value from the corresponding I/O port.  For example, you write
 * TMR_MR_LATCH into the corresponding mode register.  Presumably,
 * after doing this, a write operation to the I/O port would result
 * in undefined behavior (but hopefully not fry the chip).
 * Reading in this manner has no side effects.
 *
 * The outputs of the three timers are connected as follows:
 *
 *	 timer 0 -> irq 0
 *	 timer 1 -> dma chan 0 (for dram refresh)
 * 	 timer 2 -> speaker (via keyboard controller)
 *
 * Timer 0 is used to call hardclock.
 * Timer 2 is used to generate console beeps.

@Next try. ARC tree import. "New" Mips (spim) ARC compliant systems tree.
This tree will eventually suport viritualy all ARC compliant Mips systems,
that is all we can lay our hands on for porting/testing. It will supersede
the pica tree which will be removed shortly when this tree is functioning.

@Update the SMP branch to -current, this breaks the SMP branch though.
But it will be fixed soonish.  Note, nothing new has happened, this is just
a merge of the trunk into this branch.
