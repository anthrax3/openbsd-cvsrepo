@This directory is intended to include all Mips common code used by several
ports. This is mainly include files, common locore code, trap code, mmu
code etc.

Any code added here must be endian safe. Code with different ISA targets
has to be well documented and preferbly generate error messages if compiled
without the appropriate switches set.

Questions can be directed to pefo@@openbsd.org.

@Merge in -current from two days ago in the SMP branch.
As usual with merges, they do not indicate progress, so do not hold
your breath for working SMP, and do not mail me and ask about the
state of it.  It has not changed.  There is work ongoing, but very, very
slowly.  The commit is done in parts as to not lock up the tree in too
big chunks at a time.
