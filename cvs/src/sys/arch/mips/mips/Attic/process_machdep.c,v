/*
 * This file may seem a bit stylized, but that so that it's easier to port.
 * Functions to be implemented here are:
 *
 * process_read_regs(proc, regs)
 *	Get the current user-visible register set from the process
 *	and copy it into the regs structure (<machine/reg.h>).
 *	The process is stopped at the time read_regs is called.
 *
 * process_write_regs(proc, regs)
 *	Update the current register set from the passed in regs
 *	structure.  Take care to avoid clobbering special CPU
 *	registers or privileged bits in the PSL.
 *	The process is stopped at the time write_regs is called.
 *
 * process_sstep(proc)
 *	Arrange for the process to trap after executing a single instruction.
 *
 * process_set_pc(proc)
 *	Set the process's program counter.

@Merge in -current from two days ago in the SMP branch.
As usual with merges, they do not indicate progress, so do not hold
your breath for working SMP, and do not mail me and ask about the
state of it.  It has not changed.  There is work ongoing, but very, very
slowly.  The commit is done in parts as to not lock up the tree in too
big chunks at a time.
