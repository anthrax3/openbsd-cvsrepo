@Teach the SGEC driver about the Real World:
- check for error bits in descriptors, and count and report errors
  accordingly; make sure we do not pass up known-to-be-bad packets up the
  receive path.
- check for various error conditions which would cause the transmit process
  to go to suspended state, and recover from them, before the timeout expires.
- finally, on the VXT2000, the transmit process for some reason will reset
  its ring position to the beginning of the ring every time it completes a
  transmission burst, while we don't, so play with the head of ring register
  behind its back. This makes my VXT2000+ (net)boot multiuser.

Tested on VXT2000 (ze@@vxtbus), KA49 (ze@@vsbus) and KA53 (ze@@ibus); ok deraadt@@

@Work-in-progress VXT2000 support (commented out in GENERIC so far). Glass
console works on color model, serial console works, ethernet attaches but
does not work correctly yet.
