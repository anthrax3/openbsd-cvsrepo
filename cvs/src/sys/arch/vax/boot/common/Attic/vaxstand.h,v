@Move the vax/boot code to vax/stand.  A cvs 'mv' with de-tagging has been
done behind the scenes to retain history.  Having all the bootblocks in the
same architecture sub-directory satisfies several principles.

@Remove support for non-microVAX, non-VAXstation, non-VXT hardware in the
VAX port. This means, 11/7xx, VAX6000 and VAX8x00 systems, as well as SBI,
CMI, BI, XMI and MASSBUS drivers.
Most of these files were not being compiled or kept in compilable state over
the years anyway.

@Change daddr_t to daddr32_t.  The bootblocks on our architectures only
do 32-bit block spanning.  If later on we get some that can/should do
64-bit, that can be done now using daddr64_t (but of course, we are taking
this step to finalize the daddr_t 64-bit conversion).

@sync with netbsd -- this involved rearranging things for sanity reasons
and because separate builds of libsa are done.  this is a pretty nice
bootloader.

1.1.8.1
log
@Continue the aborted merge of current just before 2.9 was cut into the
SMP branch.  Note that this will not make any progress of SMP functionality,
it is just merging of new code from the trunk into the old branch.
Please do not ask me questions about SMP status because of this mail,
instead go read the archives of smp@@openbsd.org, where I mailed about
these commits some week ago.  Another note: I am doing this in chunks now,
so as to not lock too much of the tree for long times
