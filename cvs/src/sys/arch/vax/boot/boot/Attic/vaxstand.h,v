@Move the vax/boot code to vax/stand.  A cvs 'mv' with de-tagging has been
done behind the scenes to retain history.  Having all the bootblocks in the
same architecture sub-directory satisfies several principles.

log
@Remove support for non-microVAX, non-VAXstation, non-VXT hardware in the
VAX port. This means, 11/7xx, VAX6000 and VAX8x00 systems, as well as SBI,
CMI, BI, XMI and MASSBUS drivers.
Most of these files were not being compiled or kept in compilable state over
the years anyway.

1.2
log
@Change daddr_t to daddr32_t.  The bootblocks on our architectures only
do 32-bit block spanning.  If later on we get some that can/should do
64-bit, that can be done now using daddr64_t (but of course, we are taking
this step to finalize the daddr_t 64-bit conversion).

1.1
log
@New boot code, mostly from ragge's work in NetBSD.
Some header syncing and a couple network drivers came along for the ride.
Assembly files have been renamed from .s to .S to facilitate diffs.
Kernel is backwards compat - with manual interaction.
OpenBSD features have been preserved.
