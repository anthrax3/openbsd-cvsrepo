@Move the vax/boot code to vax/stand.  A cvs 'mv' with de-tagging has been
done behind the scenes to retain history.  Having all the bootblocks in the

1.2
log
@New boot code, mostly from ragge's work in NetBSD.
Some header syncing and a couple network drivers came along for the ride.
Assembly files have been renamed from .s to .S to facilitate diffs.
Kernel is backwards compat - with manual interaction.
OpenBSD features have been preserved.

@sync with netbsd -- this involved rearranging things for sanity reasons
and because separate builds of libsa are done.  this is a pretty nice
bootloader.

1.1.8.1
log
@Continue the aborted merge of current just before 2.9 was cut into the
SMP branch.  Note that this will not make any progress of SMP functionality,
it is just merging of new code from the trunk into the old branch.
Please do not ask me questions about SMP status because of this mail,
instead go read the archives of smp@@openbsd.org, where I mailed about
these commits some week ago.  Another note: I am doing this in chunks now,
so as to not lock too much of the tree for long times
