@Move the vax/boot code to vax/stand.  A cvs 'mv' with de-tagging has been
done behind the scenes to retain history.  Having all the bootblocks in the

@Remove support for non-microVAX, non-VAXstation, non-VXT hardware in the
VAX port. This means, 11/7xx, VAX6000 and VAX8x00 systems, as well as SBI,
CMI, BI, XMI and MASSBUS drivers.
Most of these files were not being compiled or kept in compilable state over
the years anyway.

1.1
log
@New boot code, mostly from ragge's work in NetBSD.
Some header syncing and a couple network drivers came along for the ride.
Assembly files have been renamed from .s to .S to facilitate diffs.
Kernel is backwards compat - with manual interaction.
OpenBSD features have been preserved.
