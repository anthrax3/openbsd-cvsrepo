@Remove support for non-microVAX, non-VAXstation, non-VXT hardware in the
VAX port. This means, 11/7xx, VAX6000 and VAX8x00 systems, as well as SBI,
CMI, BI, XMI and MASSBUS drivers.
Most of these files were not being compiled or kept in compilable state over
the years anyway.

1.1.8.1
log
@Continue the aborted merge of current just before 2.9 was cut into the
SMP branch.  Note that this will not make any progress of SMP functionality,
it is just merging of new code from the trunk into the old branch.
Please do not ask me questions about SMP status because of this mail,
instead go read the archives of smp@@openbsd.org, where I mailed about
these commits some week ago.  Another note: I am doing this in chunks now,
so as to not lock too much of the tree for long times
