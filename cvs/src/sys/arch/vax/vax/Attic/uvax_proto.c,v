 * MicroVAX and VAXstation and their different models have many 
 * similarities and also many very specific implementations/solutions.
 * Thus this is a trial to have generic and prototypic routines
 * which can be used instead of specific routines whenever possible.
 *
 * usually there are groups of machines using the same CPU chips, eg.
 *	MicroVAX II
 *	MicroVAX 2000
 *	VAXstation 2000
 * have the same CPU and thus can share the CPU dependent code.
 *
 * On the other hand the above machines are quite differnet wrt. the
 * way the board-specific details (system-bus, NVRAM layout, etc.)
 * and thus can't share this code. 
 *
 * It's also possible to find groups of machines which have enough
 * similarities wrt. to board-specific implementations, to share some
 * code between them. Eg.
 *	VAXstation 2000
 *	VAXstation 3100 (which models ???)
 *	VAXstation 4000 (which models ???)
 * use the same (nonexistent "virtual") system-bus and thus can share
 * some pieces of code...
