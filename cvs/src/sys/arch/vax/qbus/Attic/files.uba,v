@Remove support for non-microVAX, non-VAXstation, non-VXT hardware in the
VAX port. This means, 11/7xx, VAX6000 and VAX8x00 systems, as well as SBI,
CMI, BI, XMI and MASSBUS drivers.
Most of these files were not being compiled or kept in compilable state over
the years anyway.

@Cosmetics...
Mainly remove space between locators parens, replace spaces with tabs

@Blind merge of wscons support from NetBSD/vax. Perhaps someone with a
supported framebuffer (simple monochrome) can finish this off.
If anyone has run across docs for LCG or SPGFX, please get in touch.

1.1.8.1
log
@Continue the aborted merge of current just before 2.9 was cut into the
SMP branch.  Note that this will not make any progress of SMP functionality,
it is just merging of new code from the trunk into the old branch.
Please do not ask me questions about SMP status because of this mail,
instead go read the archives of smp@@openbsd.org, where I mailed about
these commits some week ago.  Another note: I am doing this in chunks now,
so as to not lock too much of the tree for long times

1.1.8.2
log
@Merge in -current from two days ago in the SMP branch.
As usual with merges, they do not indicate progress, so do not hold
your breath for working SMP, and do not mail me and ask about the
state of it.  It has not changed.  There is work ongoing, but very, very
slowly.  The commit is done in parts as to not lock up the tree in too
big chunks at a time.
