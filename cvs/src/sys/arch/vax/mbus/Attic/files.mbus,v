@Sync the MI LANCE code ( le(4) ) with NetBSD, except for the following:
- the am7990_get() - now lance_get() - is unchanged.
- the interrupt acknowledge logic is unchanged, and will disable interrupts,
  then acknowledge all interrupt conditions.

Add ILACC (79900) support (from NetBSD).

Both LANCE (am7990.c) and ILACC (am79900.c) code share as much common code
(lance.c) as possible. This affects all le(4) attachments, but the changes
are mostly mechanical, to split am7990-specific parts from lance-agnostic
parts.

Compile tested on all affected platforms. Tested on alpha, hp300, luna88k,
mvme88k, sparc, sparc64 and vax.

@Minimal driver for the VAXstation 35x0/38x0 LEGSS option, currently limited
to 8 bit mode operation, and no color or accelerated features until I can
find documentation about it.

Speed is decent by VAX standards, except for scrolling, which is so
abysmally slow one could see ZZ Top's beards growing while waiting for the
screen to scroll...

@Add support for the ``Firefox'' VAXstation 3520/3540/3820/3840 workstations,
currently limited to serial console and a single processor working.

All ``on-board'' devices, including the Q-bus adapter, but except for
the frame buffer, are supported. The machine will boot over the network
or from SCSI devices.

Lots of thanks to Al Kossow for www.bitsavers.org, on which I found the
technical documentation allowing me to complete this port (which was
lacking at the time I got that machine...).
