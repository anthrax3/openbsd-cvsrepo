@ddb expects the kernel longjmp() to only take a single parameter and always
return 1 since 12+ years, it's about time to fix the offending ports.

1.1
log
@New boot code, mostly from ragge's work in NetBSD.
Some header syncing and a couple network drivers came along for the ride.
Assembly files have been renamed from .s to .S to facilitate diffs.
Kernel is backwards compat - with manual interaction.
OpenBSD features have been preserved.
