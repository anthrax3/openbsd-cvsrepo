@We need to loose some weight.
If someone feels very opposed to this, the code is left in the Attic.
Just revive and _make_it_work_.

@Merge of MACHINE_NEW_CONTIG (aka MNN) code from Chuck Cranor,
<chuck@@openbsd.org>. This code is as of yet disabled on all platforms,
actually not yet supported on more than mvme68k, although other
platforms are expected soon, as code is already available.
This code makes handling of multiple physical memory regions
consistent over all platforms, as well as keeping the performance of
maintaining a single continuous memory chunk.  It is also a
requirement for the upcoming UVM replacement VM system.

What I did in this merge: just declared the pmap_map function in a
MD include file per port that needs it.  It's not an exported pmap
interface, says Chuck.  It ended up in differnt include files on
differnet ports, as I tried to follow the current policy on a per-arch
basis.

@Update the SMP branch to -current, this breaks the SMP branch though.
But it will be fixed soonish.  Note, nothing new has happened, this is just
a merge of the trunk into this branch.
