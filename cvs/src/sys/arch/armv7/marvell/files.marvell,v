@Implement a driver for Marvell's AHCI controller.  This is in essence
a generic AHCI controller with the twist that the MBUS window needs
to be configured in the controller registers.  This enables use of
SATA on devices like the SolidRun ClearFog or Omnia Turris.

1.4
log
@Implement a driver for Marvell's Mbus bridge.  This is the component
that lets e.g. the CPU access a USB controller or the USB controller
access the system's RAM.  The bridge needs to be configured for the
devices before we can access the controller or a controller our memory.

Since it otherwise acts like a simplebus, simply attach simplebus once
we are finished.

log
@Add a driver for the Marvell Armada 380 core clock.  This driver
provides information about the four big clocks that are part of
this SoC.  Attach it early as the serial console needs it and the
core clock is after the console in the device tree.
