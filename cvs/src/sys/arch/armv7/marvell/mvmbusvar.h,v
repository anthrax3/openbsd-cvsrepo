1.1
log
@Implement a driver for Marvell's Mbus bridge.  This is the component
that lets e.g. the CPU access a USB controller or the USB controller
access the system's RAM.  The bridge needs to be configured for the
devices before we can access the controller or a controller our memory.

Since it otherwise acts like a simplebus, simply attach simplebus once
we are finished.
