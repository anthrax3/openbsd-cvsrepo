1.2
log
@pl011 and pl031 are licenseable peripherals from arm present in multiple socs.
Move the pluart and plrtc drivers for them out of the vexpress directory
and into dev to reflect this and rename the files to match the driver names.

discussed with patrick and kettenis

log
@Add initial support for the ARM Versatile Express boards as emulated by
qemu with virtio memory ranges.

Unfortunately the vexpress-a9 and vexpress-a15 boards/targets have
different load addresses and memory maps.

Code for the PL011 UART and mmio virtio attachment from Patrick Wildt
in bitrig.
