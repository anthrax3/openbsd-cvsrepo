@Don't try to get a board name string before attaching mainbus with the
platform abstraction.  The string is only displayed when attaching the
soc abstractions so this is not needed.  When arm mainbus becomes aware
of fdt it can show the /model property itself.

@Make board attaching table driven and move it out into the soc
directories.  Move the device tables while here as was done in bitrig.
With these changes the only use of the board id defines is in the soc
directories.

Tested by matthieu and djm on imx and myself on omap and sunxi (qemu).
