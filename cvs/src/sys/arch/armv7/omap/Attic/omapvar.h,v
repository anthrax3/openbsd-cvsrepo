@After factorizing armv7_machdep code here is an effort to factorize all
the code present in omap/omap.c imx/imx.c and sunxi/sunxi.c

All this code looks quite the same, so we move it in a generic armv7/armv7.c

This is a step closer to only one kernel for all armv7 boards.

@Add edma driver. This driver add support for am335x edma3 controller.

With some more work, it will allow us to speed-up ommmc driver.

ok patrick@@.

@In the future, we shouldn't have one port port ARM SoC, that's just
ridiculous.  This is the first step for a common and generic ARM port
for ARMv7 SoCs.
