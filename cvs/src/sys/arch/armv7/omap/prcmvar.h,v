log
@Add additional i2c and mmc prcm module enum values for devices that
didn't attach previously on OMAP4 with the static device configuration
and now do with the fdt.  Like most of the other OMAP4 prcm cases
these don't do anything, hopefully we'll properly configure clocks with
data from the fdt at some point in the future.

Tested by abieber@@ on PandaBoard-ES.
