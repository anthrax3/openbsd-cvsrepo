1.1
log
@Merge portions of NetBSD up to 970415.

This includes:
	* All of the prototyping and KNF changes.
	* The new interrupt system.
	* Portions of the Domain Keyboard support from Mike Smith.

This does not include:
	* m68k changes, namely generic dumps.

Various sundry changes and fixes by me.
