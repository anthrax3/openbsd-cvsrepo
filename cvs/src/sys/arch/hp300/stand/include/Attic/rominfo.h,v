@Retire hp300, mvme68k and mvme88k ports. These ports have no users, keeping
this hardware alive is becoming increasingly difficult, and I should heed the
message sent by the three disks which have died on me over the last few days.

Noone sane will mourn these ports anyway. So long, and thanks for the fish.

@hp300 ELF bits. Requires many device and prom related structs to now be declared
as packed due to them containing 32-bit types at 16-bit but not 32-bit aligned
offsets. The boot block updates (especially mkboot) come straight from NetBSD.

@The grand reorganization, OpenBSD style.

Lossely based on the NetBSD reorg, but much improved upon, simpler, and doesn't
scribble needless junk into the bootblocks.
