@Retire hp300, mvme68k and mvme88k ports. These ports have no users, keeping

message sent by the three disks which have died on me over the last few days.

Noone sane will mourn these ports anyway. So long, and thanks for the fish.

@The grand reorganization, OpenBSD style.

Lossely based on the NetBSD reorg, but much improved upon, simpler, and doesn't
scribble needless junk into the bootblocks.
