@Retire hp300, mvme68k and mvme88k ports. These ports have no users, keeping
this hardware alive is becoming increasingly difficult, and I should heed the
message sent by the three disks which have died on me over the last few days.

Noone sane will mourn these ports anyway. So long, and thanks for the fish.

1.2
log
@Large cleanup of the bootblocks, including ansi protos and de-register,
removal of unused hil stuff, oversimplification of the stand ite code
(including dio frame buffer common code factorization), and sgc frame
buffer console support, at last.

This shaves ~1800 bytes off SYS_UBOOT and ~500 bytes of SYS_CDBOOT
despite the addition of the sgc code.

Tested on dca, hyper, topcat and sti.
