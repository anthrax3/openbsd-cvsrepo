1.4
log
@Large cleanup of the bootblocks, including ansi protos and de-register,
removal of unused hil stuff, oversimplification of the stand ite code
(including dio frame buffer common code factorization), and sgc frame
buffer console support, at last.

This shaves ~1800 bytes off SYS_UBOOT and ~500 bytes of SYS_CDBOOT
despite the addition of the sgc code.

Tested on dca, hyper, topcat and sti.

@The grand reorganization, OpenBSD style.

Lossely based on the NetBSD reorg, but much improved upon, simpler, and doesn't
scribble needless junk into the bootblocks.
