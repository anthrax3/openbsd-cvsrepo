@Retire hp300, mvme68k and mvme88k ports. These ports have no users, keeping
this hardware alive is becoming increasingly difficult, and I should heed the
message sent by the three disks which have died on me over the last few days.

Noone sane will mourn these ports anyway. So long, and thanks for the fish.

@Remove SLOWSCSI and the millisecond delay after each phase change it introduces.
This code was added back when the scsi code between the kernel and the boot
blocks was shared, to work around an obscure kernel problem (and definitely
not related to bootstrap, at all).

While there, increase the target selection timeout from 2ms to 250ms, to
match the value currently used by the kernel.

Crank boot blocks version. Booting a kernel from disk is now significantly
faster.

@Change boot commandline parsing to only force lowercase of the device name
part, and keep the filename unchanged.
This allows a kernel which name contains uppercase letters to be bootable,
instead of getting a `file not found' error with the filename being all
lower case.
A workaround was to prepend the filename with `/', to give an absolute path.
Yet there is no reason to lowercase the filename unless there is a boot device
prefix.

Crank version.

@So, it turns out that models 362 and 382 built-in frame buffer only shows up
in DIO-II space, as a fat device spanning four select codes (i.e. 16MB of
memory). This is way too much for an at-most 2 Mpixel 8bit frame buffer, and
it turns out that this is because the device provides both a regular DIO-II
frame buffer (spanning two select codes) and a regular STI frame buffer
(spanning the other two select codes).
This commit introduces a straightforward sti@@dio attachment to get a working
sti(4) and wsdisplay(4) in a ridiculously small number of lines; however
the console code needs some changes to avoid duplicating globals.

While there, add sti@@dio support for the bootblocks, and I couldn't help
myself but clean the most rotten parts of them, and try to have them reuse
various files in sys/arch/hp300/dev instead of rolling their outdated ones.

Tested on a real 382 with the low-resolution frame buffer:
sti0 at dio0 scode 132: rev 8.02;129, ID 0x27134CB440A00499
sti0: 382V, 2048x512 frame buffer, 640x480x8 display
sti0: 8x16 font type 1, 16 bpc, charset 0-255
wsdisplay0 at sti0 mux 1: console (std, vt100 emulation)

Boot blocks updates tested on DIO-II 425t (serial/glass console), SGC 425e
(serial/glass console) and 382 (serial/glass console). And will be tested
on SGC 425t soon as well.

@Large cleanup of the bootblocks, including ansi protos and de-register,
removal of unused hil stuff, oversimplification of the stand ite code
(including dio frame buffer common code factorization), and sgc frame
buffer console support, at last.

This shaves ~1800 bytes off SYS_UBOOT and ~500 bytes of SYS_CDBOOT
despite the addition of the sgc code.

Tested on dca, hyper, topcat and sti.
