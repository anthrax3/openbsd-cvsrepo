@Retire hp300, mvme68k and mvme88k ports. These ports have no users, keeping
this hardware alive is becoming increasingly difficult, and I should heed the
message sent by the three disks which have died on me over the last few days.

Noone sane will mourn these ports anyway. So long, and thanks for the fish.

@Change the pmap_enter interface to merge access_type and the wired boolean
and arbitrary flags into one argument.

One new flag is PMAP_CANFAIL that tells pmap_enter that it can fail if there
are not enough resources to satisfy the request. If this flag is not passed,
pmap_enter should panic as it should have done before this change (XXX - many
pmaps are still not doing that).

Only i386 and alpha implement CANFAIL for now.

Includes uvm updates from NetBSD.

@Change the pmap_enter api to pass down an argument that indicates
the access type that caused this mapping. This is to simplify pmaps
with mod/ref emulation (none for the moment) and in some cases speed
up pmap_is_{referenced,modified}.
At the same time, clean up some mappings that had too high protection.

XXX - the access type is incorrect in old vm, it's only used by uvm and MD code.
The actual use of this in pmap_enter implementations is not in this commit.

@Merge in -current from two days ago in the SMP branch.
As usual with merges, they do not indicate progress, so do not hold
your breath for working SMP, and do not mail me and ask about the
state of it.  It has not changed.  There is work ongoing, but very, very
slowly.  The commit is done in parts as to not lock up the tree in too
big chunks at a time.

This includes all of the new frodo drivers, from Michael Smith, hacked up

This compiles and runs, have not yet tested Domain kbd or apci ports.
