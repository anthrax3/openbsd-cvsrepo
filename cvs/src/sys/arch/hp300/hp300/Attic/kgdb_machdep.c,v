@Retire hp300, mvme68k and mvme88k ports. These ports have no users, keeping
this hardware alive is becoming increasingly difficult, and I should heed the
message sent by the three disks which have died on me over the last few days.

Noone sane will mourn these ports anyway. So long, and thanks for the fish.

@Sync with changes from NetBSD, up to 970705.

This includes all of the new frodo drivers, from Michael Smith, hacked up
by Jason R. Thorpe; other changes, mostly configuration and/or m68k
abstraction related, from Thorpe.  A few others of my own.

This compiles and runs, have not yet tested Domain kbd or apci ports.

@Merge in -current from two days ago in the SMP branch.
As usual with merges, they do not indicate progress, so do not hold
your breath for working SMP, and do not mail me and ask about the
state of it.  It has not changed.  There is work ongoing, but very, very
slowly.  The commit is done in parts as to not lock up the tree in too
big chunks at a time.
