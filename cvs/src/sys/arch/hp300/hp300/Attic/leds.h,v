@Retire hp300, mvme68k and mvme88k ports. These ports have no users, keeping
this hardware alive is becoming increasingly difficult, and I should heed the
message sent by the three disks which have died on me over the last few days.

Noone sane will mourn these ports anyway. So long, and thanks for the fish.

@Sync with changes from NetBSD, up to 970705.

This includes all of the new frodo drivers, from Michael Smith, hacked up
by Jason R. Thorpe; other changes, mostly configuration and/or m68k
abstraction related, from Thorpe.  A few others of my own.

This compiles and runs, have not yet tested Domain kbd or apci ports.
