@Sync with changes from NetBSD, up to 970705.

This includes all of the new frodo drivers, from Michael Smith, hacked up
by Jason R. Thorpe; other changes, mostly configuration and/or m68k
abstraction related, from Thorpe.  A few others of my own.

This compiles and runs, have not yet tested Domain kbd or apci ports.
