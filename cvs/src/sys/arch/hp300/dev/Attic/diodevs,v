@Retire hp300, mvme68k and mvme88k ports. These ports have no users, keeping
this hardware alive is becoming increasingly difficult, and I should heed the
message sent by the three disks which have died on me over the last few days.

Noone sane will mourn these ports anyway. So long, and thanks for the fish.

@So, it turns out that models 362 and 382 built-in frame buffer only shows up
in DIO-II space, as a fat device spanning four select codes (i.e. 16MB of
memory). This is way too much for an at-most 2 Mpixel 8bit frame buffer, and
it turns out that this is because the device provides both a regular DIO-II
frame buffer (spanning two select codes) and a regular STI frame buffer
(spanning the other two select codes).
This commit introduces a straightforward sti@@dio attachment to get a working
sti(4) and wsdisplay(4) in a ridiculously small number of lines; however
the console code needs some changes to avoid duplicating globals.

While there, add sti@@dio support for the bootblocks, and I couldn't help
myself but clean the most rotten parts of them, and try to have them reuse
various files in sys/arch/hp300/dev instead of rolling their outdated ones.

Tested on a real 382 with the low-resolution frame buffer:
sti0 at dio0 scode 132: rev 8.02;129, ID 0x27134CB440A00499
sti0: 382V, 2048x512 frame buffer, 640x480x8 display
sti0: 8x16 font type 1, 16 bpc, charset 0-255
wsdisplay0 at sti0 mux 1: console (std, vt100 emulation)

Boot blocks updates tested on DIO-II 425t (serial/glass console), SGC 425e
(serial/glass console) and 382 (serial/glass console). And will be tested
on SGC 425t soon as well.

@First pass at removing clauses 3 and 4 from NetBSD licenses.

Not sure what's more surprising: how long it took for NetBSD to
catch up to the rest of the BSDs (including UCB), or the amount of
code that NetBSD has claimed for itself without attributing to the
actual authors.

OK deraadt@@

@The built-in frame buffer in models 362 and 382 actually comes in different
flavours. Add another frame buffer ID to recognize it, so that it gets
skipped correctly.

I am quite sure it has an SGC PROM in addition to the DIO PROM, but I don't
have the hardware to check...

@Identify HP 9000/362 and HP 9000/382 models, and attach frodo on them.
Model 382 can be identified with a unique MMUID value; model 362 is told
from model 360 by probing for the frodo chip. Their built-in frame buffer
is not supported at the moment.
