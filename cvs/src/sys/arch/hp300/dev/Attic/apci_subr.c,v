@Retire hp300, mvme68k and mvme88k ports. These ports have no users, keeping
this hardware alive is becoming increasingly difficult, and I should heed the
message sent by the three disks which have died on me over the last few days.

Noone sane will mourn these ports anyway. So long, and thanks for the fish.

log
@First pass at removing clauses 3 and 4 from NetBSD licenses.

Not sure what's more surprising: how long it took for NetBSD to
catch up to the rest of the BSDs (including UCB), or the amount of
code that NetBSD has claimed for itself without attributing to the
actual authors.

@Driver for the Apollo Domain keyboard and mouse, for the HP 9000/4xx series.

Claims the console keyboard if a keyboard is detected at boot time,
otherwise HIL is preferred (but due to wsmux both can be used simultaneously).
