@Retire hp300, mvme68k and mvme88k ports. These ports have no users, keeping
this hardware alive is becoming increasingly difficult, and I should heed the
message sent by the three disks which have died on me over the last few days.

Noone sane will mourn these ports anyway. So long, and thanks for the fish.

@Preliminary support for the hp300 single ISA slot found in 4xx `t' models.
Everything works well but interrupts, where no two devices causes the frodo
chip to behave in the same way... (polling will work nicely)
