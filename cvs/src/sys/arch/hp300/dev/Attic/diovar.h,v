@Retire hp300, mvme68k and mvme88k ports. These ports have no users, keeping
this hardware alive is becoming increasingly difficult, and I should heed the
message sent by the three disks which have died on me over the last few days.

Noone sane will mourn these ports anyway. So long, and thanks for the fish.

log
@Turn DIO_INHOLE() into a function, returning the next select code to probe at;
and skip function codes 132 to 135, inclusive, on models 362 and 382 - this
is a fake DIO device probably intended to let non-SGC aware (i.e. legacy)
HP-UX lowlevel code be able to ``detect'' a frame buffer.

This change (as well as letting sgc attach) is untested due to the lack of any
3x2 hardware, but shouldn't make things worse.

log
@First pass at removing clauses 3 and 4 from NetBSD licenses.

Not sure what's more surprising: how long it took for NetBSD to
catch up to the rest of the BSDs (including UCB), or the amount of
code that NetBSD has claimed for itself without attributing to the
actual authors.

@Sync with changes from NetBSD, up to 970705.

This includes all of the new frodo drivers, from Michael Smith, hacked up

This compiles and runs, have not yet tested Domain kbd or apci ports.
