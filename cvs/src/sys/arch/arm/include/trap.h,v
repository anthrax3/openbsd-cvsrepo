 * Instructions used for breakpoints.

 * These are undefined instructions.
 * Technically the userspace breakpoint could be a SWI but we want to
 * keep this the same as IPKDB which needs an undefined instruction as
 * a break point.
 *
 * Ideally ARM would define several standard instruction sequences for
 * use as breakpoints.
 *
 * The BKPT instruction isn't much use to us, since its behaviour is
 * unpredictable on ARMv3 and lower.
 *
 * The ARM ARM says that for maximum compatibility, we should use undefined
 * instructions that look like 0x.7f...f. .
