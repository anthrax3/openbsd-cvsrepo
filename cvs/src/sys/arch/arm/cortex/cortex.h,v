1.1
log
@Add a cortex bus which represents the ARM MPCore Complex.
It will attach only to ARM Cortex A9 and A15 SoCs.
The generic interrupt controller and timer will attach to this bus,
later a secondary cache controller can be added.
The base address for those controllers are figured out using
the periphbase register.
