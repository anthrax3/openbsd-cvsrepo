@None of the mainbus child devices care about getting a bus_space_tag_t from
its parent, because they know better; so don't bother providing one, which
allows more unused code to go to the Attic.

While there, redo the config machinery for mainbus child devices, to bring
it to our current standards. This also allows them to be disabled in UKC,
should there be a need for this in the future.
