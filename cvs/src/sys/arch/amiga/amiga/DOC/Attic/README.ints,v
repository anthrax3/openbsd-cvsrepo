@amiga and sun3 turned out to not be y2k+3 compliant here. Remove them, as
well as the few userland tools which were only used on these platforms.

There are four different interruptsystems currently supported (well
only three, really) in the kernel.  They are all mutual exclusive:

1	Default

	Requires no kernel compiletime options to be set in the
	config-file.  The default interrupt system is characterized by
	never fiddling with the interrupt levels during service of
	interrupts.  Drivers that want to can explicitly schedule
	softint or VBL callbacks, but that is all.

2	LEV6_DEFER

	Requires "options LEV6_DEFER" to be specified in the kernel
	config-file.  This will defer level 6 interrupts to level 4 by
	temporarily blocking level 6 interrupts via the Amiga custom
	interrupt controller and set the AUD3 interrupt bit in that
	same chip.  This will imply a level 4 interrupt to be
	scheduled.  In that handler after the level 6 interrupt has
	been serviced, IPL 6 is unblocked again.  This will have
	positive effect on interrupts coming in at IPL 5, specifically
	the serial receive interrupt.  A potential trouble area is
	audio when using that fourth channel, that is something to
	check when someone gets the time.  This clever hack was done
	by Markus Wild.

3	IPL_REMAP_1

	Enabled by "options IPL_REMAP_1" in the config-file.  With the
	arrival of ISA-bus bridges, it became appearant that
	interrupts at level 6 must be rescheduleable to *any* IPL.  In
	order to not be intrusive on existing ISA code a scheme
	inspired by Markus Wild's LEV6_DEFER were designed by Niklas
	Hallqvist <niklas@@appli.se>.  Every Amiga-native driver for
	devices at IPL 6 need to register a mapped IPL at which it
	wants its interrupts to be serviced.  At interrupt time the
	level 6 interrupts get blocked just like in LEV6_DEFER, and
	then the system will loop through the interrupt levels from
	high to low IPL servicing the highest interrupt scheduled.
	There is special care taken to interrupts coming in while
	already at some IPL above zero.

4	IPL_REMAP_2

	This system isn't yet ready, there are only hooks for it yet.
	It is an experiment meant to address the performance problems
	of IPL_REMAP_1 and ISA-drivers needing fast handling, like
	fast serial devices.

@Merge in -current from two days ago in the SMP branch.
As usual with merges, they do not indicate progress, so do not hold
your breath for working SMP, and do not mail me and ask about the
state of it.  It has not changed.  There is work ongoing, but very, very
slowly.  The commit is done in parts as to not lock up the tree in too
big chunks at a time.
