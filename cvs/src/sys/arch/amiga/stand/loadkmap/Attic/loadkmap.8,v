@amiga and sun3 turned out to not be y2k+3 compliant here. Remove them, as
well as the few userland tools which were only used on these platforms.

.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm loadkmap
.Nd load keyboard map
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm loadkmap
.Op Ar file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
loads the specified keyboard map
.Ar file
into the console.
.Pp
If no argument is given
.Nm
retrieves the current keymap associated to the console, and dumps it to
standard output.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width sys/arch/amiga/stand/loadkmap -compact
.It Pa /usr/share/keymaps
repository of known amiga keymap files.
.It Pa sys/arch/amiga/stand/loadkmap
sources to those keymap files.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr ite 4
.Sh BUGS
The format of the keymap files is ill-specified, incomplete, and likely
to change in the future.
.Nm
should be replaced by the more generic
.Xr kbd 1 ,
which does not exist on the amiga at the moment.

log
@- remove all trailing whitespace
     * except when it is escaped with a `\' at the end of the line
- fix remaining .Nm usage as well
- this is from a patch I received from kwesterback@@home.com, who has been
  working on some scripts for fixing formatting errors in mdoc'd man pages

Ok, so there could be a cost/benefit debate with this commit, but since I have
the patch we might as well commit it...
