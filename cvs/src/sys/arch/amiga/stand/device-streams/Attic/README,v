Here are some programs I whipped together for use in NetBSD.  I hope
that these replace ``devtofile'' and ``filetodev''.  They are much safer
programs to use, plus that can use streams not just files. e.g.

	devtofile --rdb=BSD_TRANSFER --quiet | tar -xvf -

although streamtodev seems to have a bit of a problem with tar, tar terminates
before streamtodev has read all of tar's input...

Anyway all 4 stream programs will not allow you to cross partition boundries,
and they only work on devices that have RDB's.  The 2 x{program}'s add the
``feature'' of letting you specify start and end blocks within a partition's
boundries.  I never use this but with it comes almost the same functionality
as ``filetodev'' and ``devtofile'' (still with some safeguards).

type {program} --help for a template and options.

One thing I should point out, all the options are search restrictors, if not
specified then they are treated as matching everything, e.g. ``streamtodev''
will grab the first partition on the first unit of the first device it finds
on the dos list.  Play around with ``rdbinfo'' for a while if you don't
understand this; all the programs use a similar algorithm.

I have tested these somewhat, but I cannot guarentee they work perfect
therefore I insert my standard disclaimer:
