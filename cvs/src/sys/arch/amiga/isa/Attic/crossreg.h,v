/***
* 
*
* Hardware description:
*
*  The CrossLink board is a 64K autoconfig device. The board address can be
*  read from the xlink.resource structure instead of searching with the
*  expansion library. In this way, the manufacturer ID is not required by
*  the software developer.
*
*  Address mapping is as follows:
*   XL_ROM     16K of byte wide ROM appearing at even locations.
*              Used to hold the xlink.resource, and any autobooting
*              devices.
*   XL_MEM     Memory space. For 8 bit cards, bytes appear at even
*              locations, (ie multiply address by 2). For 16 bit cards,
*              words appear at long word boundaries (ie multiply by
*              2). You can read bytes from 16 bit cards - odd bytes
*              will appear at odd locations. SBHE must be set to the
*              appropriate value for this. Multiple pages are accessible
*              via the page register (see MemPage register).
*   XL_IO      I/O space. 8K of I/O space is supported by the hardware,
*              however only 1K is managed by this resource (as IBM's
*              *never* have cards which decode more I/O space than this).
*              You should AllocPortSpace() the area you want to use to
*              get exclusive access before using the I/O. 8/16 bit cards
*              read/write bytes/words at word boundaries. (You should know
*              whether the port is 8 or 16 bits wide).
*
* Within the 1K I/O space, there are some 8 and 16 bit registers on the
* xlink board itself. These registers are normally only accessed by
* the xlink.resource, they are only described here for completeness.
* Later revisions of the CrossLink board may move/change the meaning
* of these registers. They are as follows:
* (actual address = SBP_xxxx + SB_IO + board address)
*
*   XLP_LATCH  (Write Only) (offset = 2)
*              Latches most significant address lines. D0-D6 contain the
*              values for the most significant 7 address lines (A13-A19).
*              D7 contains data for SBHE line (always 1 for 8 bit transfers
*              on 8 bit boards, and 16 bit transfers on 16 bit boards.
*              Set SBHE to 0 to perform 8 bit transfers on 16 bit boards).
*
*   XLP_INTABLE (Write Only) (offset = 0)
*              Interrupt Enable & Disable. Bits map to the interrupts in
*              the following manner:
*                Data   Interrupt          Data   Interrupt
*                 2        10               10       2
*                 3        11               11       3
*                 4        12               12       4
*                 5        Master           13       5
*                 6        14               14       6
*                 7        15               15       7
*              Unused bits should not be interpreted in any way. When
*              writing to this register, unused bits should be zero. This
*              register should only be used by the xlink.resource.
*
*   XLP_INTSTAT (Read Only) (offset = 0)
*              Interrupt Status. Bit mapping is the same as the
*              XLP_INTABLE location. Normally you only need to add your
*              interrupt handler to the appropriate port, and not worry
*              about this register. However, it can be also used to
*              determine which interrupt a board is connected to.
