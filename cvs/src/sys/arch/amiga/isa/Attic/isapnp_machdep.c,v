@amiga and sun3 turned out to not be y2k+3 compliant here. Remove them, as
well as the few userland tools which were only used on these platforms.

 * Machine-dependent portions of ISA PnP bus autoconfiguration.
 *
 * N.B. This file exists mostly to get around some lameness surrounding
 * the PnP spec.  ISA PnP registers live where some `normal' ISA
 * devices do, but are e.g. write-only registers where the normal
 * device has a read-only register.  This breaks in the presence of
 * i/o port accounting.  This file takes care of mapping ISA PnP
 * registers without actually allocating them in extent maps.
 *
 * Since this is a machine-dependent file, we make all sorts of
 * assumptions about bus.h's guts.  Beware!
