log
@Fix efiboot not to use the usual kernel load address.  Load the kernel in
an allocated region and also move the stack to the end of the heap region.
Then move the kernel to the usual place just before run the kernel, after
calling ExitBootService().

@First pass at removing clauses 3 and 4 from NetBSD licenses.

Not sure what's more surprising: how long it took for NetBSD to
catch up to the rest of the BSDs (including UCB), or the amount of
code that NetBSD has claimed for itself without attributing to the
actual authors.

@Pull out the ELF loadfile pieces from the standalone libraries, so that
both 32- and 64-bit versions can be created (previously only one or the
other could be built for a given boot loader).

Use this to allow the i386 and amd64 boot blocks to boot both ELF32 and
ELF64 kernels (i.e. amd64 boot blocks can now load i386 kernels, and
vice versa).  Obviously the system must support LONG mode in order to
successfully run the amd64 kernel once it is loaded.

Advice and discussions from/with dale@@ (going back three years).  Much
testing nick@@ and todd@@; thanks.

@an amd64 arch support.
hacked by art@@ from netbsd sources and then later debugged
by me into the shape where it can host itself.
no bootloader yet as needs redoing from the
recent advanced i386 sources (anyone? ;)
