@Add support for x2apic mode

This is currently only enabled on hypervisors because on real hardware, it
requires interrupt remapping which we don't support yet. But on virtualization
it reduces the number of vmexits required per IPI from 4 to 1, causing a
significant speed-up for MP guests.

@First pass at removing clauses 3 and 4 from NetBSD licenses.

Not sure what's more surprising: how long it took for NetBSD to
catch up to the rest of the BSDs (including UCB), or the amount of
code that NetBSD has claimed for itself without attributing to the
actual authors.

@an amd64 arch support.
hacked by art@@ from netbsd sources and then later debugged
by me into the shape where it can host itself.
no bootloader yet as needs redoing from the
