@Switch from TSS-per-process to TSS-per-CPU, placing the TSS right
next to the cpu's GDT, also making the double-fault stack per-CPU,
leaving it at the top of the page of the CPU's idle process.  Inline
pmap_activate() and pmap_deactivate() into the asm cpu_switchto
routine, adding a check for the new pmap already being marked as
active on the CPU.  Garbage collect the hasn't-been-used-in-years
GDT update IPI.

Tested by many; ok mikeb@@, kettenis@@

@an amd64 arch support.
hacked by art@@ from netbsd sources and then later debugged
by me into the shape where it can host itself.
no bootloader yet as needs redoing from the
recent advanced i386 sources (anyone? ;)
