@Switch from TSS-per-process to TSS-per-CPU, placing the TSS right
next to the cpu's GDT, also making the double-fault stack per-CPU,
leaving it at the top of the page of the CPU's idle process.  Inline
pmap_activate() and pmap_deactivate() into the asm cpu_switchto
routine, adding a check for the new pmap already being marked as
active on the CPU.  Garbage collect the hasn't-been-used-in-years
GDT update IPI.

@Free TSS on the stack of the dead process.

In order to do that we have to remove all sleeping parts: sleeping
memory allocation and a sleeping lock.  Thus we're moving this code
to the spinning lock (mutex) and getting rid of the GDT grow code.
Downside is that now we're pre-allocating 64kb of memory per CPU
from the start, but this might be optimized in future.

This also unifies GDT code and MAXGDTSIZ define across i386 and amd64.

With help from mickey.

ok toby, art

@First pass at removing clauses 3 and 4 from NetBSD licenses.

Not sure what's more surprising: how long it took for NetBSD to
catch up to the rest of the BSDs (including UCB), or the amount of
code that NetBSD has claimed for itself without attributing to the
actual authors.

@an amd64 arch support.
hacked by art@@ from netbsd sources and then later debugged
by me into the shape where it can host itself.
no bootloader yet as needs redoing from the
recent advanced i386 sources (anyone? ;)
