@First pass at removing clauses 3 and 4 from NetBSD licenses.

code that NetBSD has claimed for itself without attributing to the
actual authors.

@an amd64 arch support.
hacked by art@@ from netbsd sources and then later debugged
by me into the shape where it can host itself.
no bootloader yet as needs redoing from the
recent advanced i386 sources (anyone? ;)
