Split the MP trampoline into two pages, one for code and one for data/stack
and then protect the code page as RX and the data/stack page as RW (NX).

Don't use the first 64KB for anything, including tramps. Move tramps and
hibernate goo up after 64KB to avoid posible corruption by buggy BIOS SMM
code. Diff also ensures the first 64KB doesn't get handed to UVM either.

@First pass at removing clauses 3 and 4 from NetBSD licenses.

Not sure what's more surprising: how long it took for NetBSD to
catch up to the rest of the BSDs (including UCB), or the amount of
code that NetBSD has claimed for itself without attributing to the
actual authors.

@an amd64 arch support.
hacked by art@@ from netbsd sources and then later debugged
by me into the shape where it can host itself.
no bootloader yet as needs redoing from the
recent advanced i386 sources (anyone? ;)
