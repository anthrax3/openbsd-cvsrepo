@emul_native is only used for kernel threads which can't dump core, so
delete coredump_trad(), uvm_coredump(), cpu_coredump(), struct md_coredump,
and various #includes that are superfluous.

This leaves compat_linux processes without a coredump callback.  If that
ability is desired, someone should update it to use coredump_elf32() and
verify the results...

@Add support for per-rthread base-offset for the %fs selector on amd64.
Add pcb_fsbase to the PCB for tracking what the value for the thread
is, and ci_cur_fsbase to struct cpu_info for tracking the CPU's current
value for FS.base, then on return to user-space, skip the setting if the
CPU has the right value already.  Non-threaded processes without TLS leave
FS.base zero, which can be conveniently optimized: setting %fs zeros
FS.base for fewer cycles than wrmsr.

@Switch from TSS-per-process to TSS-per-CPU, placing the TSS right

@The LDT is only used by dead compat code now, so load the ldt
register with the null selector (disabling use of it), stop reloading
it on every context switch, and blow away the table itself, as well
as the pcb and pmap bits that were used to track it.  Also, delete
two other unused pcb members: pcb_usersp and pcb_flags.  (Deleting
pcb_usersp also keeps the pcb_savefpu member aligned properly.)
Finally, delete the defines for the unimplemented AMD64_{GET,SET}_LDT
sysarch() calls.

@First pass at removing clauses 3 and 4 from NetBSD licenses.

Not sure what's more surprising: how long it took for NetBSD to
catch up to the rest of the BSDs (including UCB), or the amount of
code that NetBSD has claimed for itself without attributing to the
actual authors.
