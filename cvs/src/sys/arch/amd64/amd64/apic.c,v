@Make the i386 APIC code closer to the amd64 version.  Many whitespace fixes,

@First pass at removing clauses 3 and 4 from NetBSD licenses.

Not sure what's more surprising: how long it took for NetBSD to
catch up to the rest of the BSDs (including UCB), or the amount of
code that NetBSD has claimed for itself without attributing to the
actual authors.

@SMP support. Big parts from NetBSD, but with some really serious debugging
done by me, niklas and others. Especially wrt. NXE support.

Still needs some polishing, especially in dmesg messages, but we're now
building kernel faster than ever.
