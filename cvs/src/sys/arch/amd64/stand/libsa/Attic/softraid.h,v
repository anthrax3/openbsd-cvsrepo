@Rename softraid boot files, which are currently in an MD location. This
will allow us to bring in a MI softraid.{c,h} in lib/libsa.

1.1
log
@Move the code for softraid boot into separate files, leaving only minimal
hooks that are called from the normal code path. This allows softraid boot
support to be completely enabled or disabled at compile time. For boot(8)
all softraid boot support is now enabled by default, including support for
booting from crypto volumes. Disable softraid boot support for fdboot,
which further shrinks the binary.
