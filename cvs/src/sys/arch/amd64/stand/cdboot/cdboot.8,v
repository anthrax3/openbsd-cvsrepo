.Dt CDBOOT 8 amd64
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm cdboot
.Nd amd64-specific second-stage CD-specific bootstrap
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a modified version of the amd64 second-stage bootstrap program,
.Xr boot 8 ,
configured to be run by the
.Ox
El Torito CD-ROM boot sector
.Pa cdbr .
.Nm
will look for an
.Pa /etc/boot.conf
configuration
file on the CD-ROM.
If it finds one, it processes the commands within it.
.Pa boot.conf
processing can be skipped by holding down either Control key as
.Nm
starts.
.Pp
.Nm
then sits in a loop,
processing commands given by the user.
It accepts all the commands accepted by
.Xr boot 8 .
.Pp
If no commands are given for a short time,
.Nm
will then attempt to load an
.Ox
kernel from the CD.
It first looks for the install kernel
.Pa bsd.rd
in the standard amd64 release directory
(e.g.\&
.Pa /3.6/amd64/bsd.rd ) ,
then for
.Pa /bsd .
It may be told to boot an alternative kernel,
either by commands in the
.Pa boot.conf
file,
or by commands typed by the user at the
.Ic boot>
prompt.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /usr/mdec/cdbootxx -compact
.It Pa /usr/mdec/cdboot
CD-specific second-stage bootstrap
.It Pa /etc/boot.conf
.Nm
configuration file (read from CD)
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
Boot the install kernel:
.Pp
.Dl boot> bsd.rd
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr boot 8 ,
.Xr boot_amd64 8 ,
.Xr mkhybrid 8

.Re
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
program first appeared in
.Ox 3.6 .
.Sh CAVEATS
By default, many CD creation programs restrict filenames to
the MS-DOS 8.3 format.
Unless this is changed,
.Nm
will not be able to read its
.Xr boot.conf 8
file.
For example, with
.Xr mkhybrid 8
the
.Fl l
option should be specified.
.Sh BUGS
The
.Ic ls
command does not work on ISO 9660 (cd9660) filesystems,
which are used on most CDs.
