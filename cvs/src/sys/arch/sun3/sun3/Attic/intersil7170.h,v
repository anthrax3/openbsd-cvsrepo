@all modified code can now compile with -Werror -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes
CAVEAT: turning off -O2 produces warnings about "defined but not used"
        functions from libkern.h

removed internal copy of gets() replaced with call to getsn()

fixed #ifdef ... #endif mismatch in swapgeneric.c

fixed printf() in if_ie.c that was missing an argument

fixed si.c so that it compiles

added tags to all edited files
