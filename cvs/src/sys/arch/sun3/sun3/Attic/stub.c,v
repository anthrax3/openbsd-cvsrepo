1.6.8.1
log
@Continue the aborted merge of current just before 2.9 was cut into the
SMP branch.  Note that this will not make any progress of SMP functionality,
it is just merging of new code from the trunk into the old branch.
Please do not ask me questions about SMP status because of this mail,
instead go read the archives of smp@@openbsd.org, where I mailed about
these commits some week ago.  Another note: I am doing this in chunks now,
so as to not lock too much of the tree for long times

@Merge in -current from two days ago in the SMP branch.
As usual with merges, they do not indicate progress, so do not hold
your breath for working SMP, and do not mail me and ask about the
state of it.  It has not changed.  There is work ongoing, but very, very
slowly.  The commit is done in parts as to not lock up the tree in too
big chunks at a time.
