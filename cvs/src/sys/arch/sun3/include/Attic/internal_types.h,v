@amiga and sun3 turned out to not be y2k+3 compliant here. Remove them, as
well as the few userland tools which were only used on these platforms.

1.1
log
@Introduce a new file, machine/internal_types.h, to hold that specific arch
type characteristics.

internal_types.h will contain only settings invisible from standard C, e.g.,
in the __* or _[A-Z]* namespace, and be reused by files like limits.h.

This allows us to shorten machine/limits.h greatly, as all the common defines
are now in sys/limits.h, plus a small stub in internal_types.h.

Tested on all arches as far as I know.
Approved after discussion with art, millert, deraadt, and others.
