log
@bring in KAME IPv6 code, dated 19991208.
replaces NRL IPv6 layer.  reuses NRL pcb layer.  no IPsec-on-v6 support.
see sys/netinet6/{TODO,IMPLEMENTATION} for more details.

GENERIC configuration should work fine as before.  GENERIC.v6 works fine
as well, but you'll need KAME userland tools to play with IPv6 (will be
bringed into soon).
