@TODOs for KAME/OpenBSD
Jun-ichiro Hagino, KAME project
KAME Id: TODO,v 1.32 1999/12/08 05:49:27 itojun Exp
$OpenBSD: TODO,v 1.6 2000/02/25 07:31:21 itojun Exp $


Please refrain from making too much changes to sys/netinet6 tree (even if
cosmetic), as we (KAME team) shares these code in all KAME/*BSD.  If you
keep the tree untouched, that will help us upgrade to more recent KAME tree.


Things we can do with the current code:
- ip6 layer
	ip6 output, ip6 input
- icmp6 layer
	replies to ping, DAD
- raw6 socket input/output
- tcp6 socket input/output (both daemon and client)
- udp6 socket input/output (need more testing)
- "options IPSEC" compiles (enabled by default in sys/conf/files), but
  it means OpenBSD IPsec for IPv4 only.  Efforts are ongoing to support IPv6
  with OpenBSD IPsec.
- hoplimit control advapi works fine.
- works just fine on i386 and sparc.

Things we can't do with the current code:
- setsockopt(), ioctl and advapi needs more checking
- check advanced APIs (both userland and kernel)
- multicast related items need checking
- ip6_output() does not consult /128 routes, and will not obey icmp6 redir.
- ssh6 port does not work on sparc (ssh does not work.  sshd works fine - why?)
- NIS IPv6 name lookup compatibility with Solaris 2.8 (ipnodes.byname).
  currently NIS will be looked up only for IPv4 names.

Cleanup todo:
- organize kame/sys/netinet6/in6_src.c and kame/sys/netinet6/in6_pcb.c better
  for maximum code sharing.
- nuke unnecessary #ifdef in NRL tcp/udp layer, for more readability
	(is it okay to do it?)
- security auditing :-)
- tcp/udp/raw socket code has too many #ifdefs

- when both INET and INET6 listening sockets are available, route IPv4
  connection to INET socket (instead of INET6 socket with using mapped addr).

@Merge in -current from two days ago in the SMP branch.
As usual with merges, they do not indicate progress, so do not hold
your breath for working SMP, and do not mail me and ask about the
state of it.  It has not changed.  There is work ongoing, but very, very
slowly.  The commit is done in parts as to not lock up the tree in too
big chunks at a time.

  it means OpenBSD IPsec for IPv4 only.  KAME IPsec is not available
  (and will never be available as OpenBSD group will not be switching
  IPsec code).  Because of this IPv6 IPsec is not available.

- due to library twists, you can't specify IPv6 network name to ifconfig(8).
  it will be fixed once libinet6 is integrated into libc.

- ipv4 mapped address
a31 5
- if you login via ssh, over IPv4 traffic to AF_INET6 socket (using IPv4
  mapped addres), login(1) or some other program *sometimes* dies with SEGV
  (string too long on wtmp?)
  workaround: run sshd -4, then sshd -6.  strangely enough no error will
  be raised with this configuration.
