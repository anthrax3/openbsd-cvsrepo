@PS/2 style and older style HIL keyboards have different layouts in their
international flavours, so provide two sets of mappings.

log
@Machine independent HP-HIL loop support code.

Derived from the hp300 HIL code, and some information found in XFree86
HP-UX specific parts.

However, this code does not provide an HP-UX compatible /dev/hil* interface,
but will rather attach real BSD drivers to the hil driver glue.

Currently, only a driver for the HP-HIL keyboards is provided. More to come
as resources permit.

The international layout tables for hilkbd are derived from the ite tables
found in the hp300 code, but only the US layout could be tested.

Sample dmesg output on a heavily charged hil loop:
hil0 at gsc0 offset 21000 irq 1
hilkbd0 at hil0 code 1: 109-key keyboard, layout 1b
wskbd0 at hilkbd0: console keyboard
hilkbd1 at hil0 code 2: 109-key keyboard, layout 1f
wskbd1 at hilkbd1
"ID module" at hil0 id 34 code 3 not configured
"ID module" at hil0 id 34 code 4 not configured
"Tablet" at hil0 id 94 code 5 not configured
"Mouse" at hil0 id 68 code 6 not configured

Some feedback from and ok mickey@@
