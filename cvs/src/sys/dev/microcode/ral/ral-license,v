@Separate rum(4) firmware from ral(4) ones.

ral(4) firmwares are built on PCI-capable architectures only while rum(4)
firmware is built on USB-capable architectures only.
Rename ral-rt2573 into rum-rt2573 and build rum-rt2573 on the zaurus too
(pointed out by Patrick Heim).

1.1
log
@- add preliminary support for Ralink Technology RT2561, RT2561S and RT2661
  chipsets in ral(4).
- restructure the code a bit; split ic/ral.c into ic/rt2560.c and ic/rt2661.c
- import the 8051 microcode files required by these chipsets.
- more to come;  there is currently no automatic rate control and some
  features are untested (hostap and ibss modes for instance).  most of
  the pre-802.11n capabilities of the RT2661 chipset are not supported
  (like frame aggregation, piggy-back).  MIMO should work though the
  performance/range gain has not been measured.
