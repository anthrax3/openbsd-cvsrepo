@Sync ahc with NetBSD, which was in turn updated from FreeBSD by Pascal
Renauld of Network Storage Solutions, Inc. Many fixes, wider device
support. In particular, the notorious 'Target 0' problem seems to be
fixed.

Does *not* include any updates to isa or eisa code beyond what was
necessary to compile.

Known issues:

1) Tagged Queuing is probably not optimal.

2) PPR negotiation may not be fully functional.

3) No support yet for freezing devices or channels.

4) The mechanism for preventing 'A' and 'B' channel confusion during probe
can fail if scsibus > 254 found.

5) Requeuing I/O's not working. A workaround will be committed almost
immediately. At the moment timeouts, SCSI message rejects, aborting
SCB's and trying to freeze a device may cause incomplete i/o's to be
reported as complete.

6) Verbosity and probe messages need work.

7) Last disk on bus seems to go through an extra re-negotiation.

8) >16 devices on an adapter will trigger the usual problems of total
openings exceeding available SCB's under heavy load.

Tested by deraadt@@, beck@@, miod@@, naddy@@, drahn@@, marc@@ amoung
others.
