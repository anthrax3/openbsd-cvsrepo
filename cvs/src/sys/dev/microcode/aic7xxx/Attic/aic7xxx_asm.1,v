.Dt AIC7XXX_ASM 1
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm aic7xxx_asm
.Nd Assembler for the Adaptec aic7xxx family of asics
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm aic7xxx_asm
.Op Fl d
.Op Fl D Ar variable=value
.Op Fl v
.Op Fl o Ar file
.Ar source-file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The Adaptec aic7xxx family of asics are single chip SCSI controllers with a
RISC like command processor.  This assembler parses the language outlined
in the Adaptec technical document
.%T "AIC-7770 (EISA/ISA Bus Master Single-Chip SCSI Host Adaptor) Data Book"
and produces ascii output intended for a C byte array.
.Pp
The aic7xxx assembler is required to compile kernels with aic7xxx SCSI
adaptor support (AHA-274x, AHA-284x, AHA-294x controllers) and is compiled,
installed, and used automatically in the kernel compile directory when
necessary.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl D Ar variable=value
Define
.Ar variable
to be
.Ar value
in the global context
.It Fl d
Turn on debugging
.It Fl v
Print version information
.It Fl o Ar file
Redirect assembler output to
.Ar file
.Sh AUTHOR
This aic7770 assembler was written by
John Aycock (aycock@@cpsc.ucalgary.ca)

@- remove all trailing whitespace
     * except when it is escaped with a `\' at the end of the line
- fix remaining .Nm usage as well
- this is from a patch I received from kwesterback@@home.com, who has been
  working on some scripts for fixing formatting errors in mdoc'd man pages

Ok, so there could be a cost/benefit debate with this commit, but since I have
the patch we might as well commit it...

@Adaption to new bus.h from NetBSD.  Various driver has been updated to
NetBSD 961107 state.  Other has not, partly because sometimes the bus.h
changes was coupled with other changes.
