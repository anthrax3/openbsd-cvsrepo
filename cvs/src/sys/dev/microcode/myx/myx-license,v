@update the firmware to 1.4.50 via freebsd.

the freebsd firmwares are compressed and get the kernel to uncompress them
to use them. we uncompress in build.c so the kernel can just read off disk
onto the card without any extra work. this lets us copy future fbsd fw
updates directly without any extra work.

myri have also rescinded one of the clauses on their license.
