@ * Firmware for Alteon Tigon 1 chip.
 * Generated by genfw.c

 * $FreeBSD: /c/ncvs/src/sys/pci/ti_fw.h,v 1.9 2000/07/20 22:24:42 wpaul Exp $

We distribute this firmware although the 'license' above does seem
conclusive.  We have tried for many years to contact all the potential
copyright owners and people who used to distribute this (ie. wpaul and
such), to get the original license text clarified.  We believe the
original license on the source did specifically allow re-distribution.
We believe we have done enough in this situation, especially
considering how dead this product is.  If anyone else knows more,
please let us know.

This is the license that applies to the tigon1 and tigon2 firmware files
used by the ti(4) driver.

@explain the pedigree of these firmwares, since the license is not quite right.
We feel we have done due diligence though in trying to contact the original
distributors, and therefore, we do distribute it.
