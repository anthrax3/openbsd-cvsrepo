log
@First pass at removing clauses 3 and 4 from NetBSD licenses.

catch up to the rest of the BSDs (including UCB), or the amount of
code that NetBSD has claimed for itself without attributing to the
actual authors.

@urio(4) - Diamond Multimedia RIO 500 (from NetBSD)

This driver will eventually go away as it really should be implemented
using ugen(4) instead.
