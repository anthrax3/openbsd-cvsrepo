@Get rid of various 'typedef struct' definitions and use plain structure

@First pass at removing clauses 3 and 4 from NetBSD licenses.

Not sure what's more surprising: how long it took for NetBSD to
catch up to the rest of the BSDs (including UCB), or the amount of
code that NetBSD has claimed for itself without attributing to the
actual authors.

@filesystem firmware loading for uyap(4).  this should work, i wrote it very
carefully.  unfortunately, we cannot find anyone who has one of these devices
in our entire user community, thus far.  commit it anyways.  whoever finds
one can contact me if there is a problem.

@Merge in -current from two days ago in the SMP branch.
As usual with merges, they do not indicate progress, so do not hold
your breath for working SMP, and do not mail me and ask about the
state of it.  It has not changed.  There is work ongoing, but very, very
slowly.  The commit is done in parts as to not lock up the tree in too
big chunks at a time.
