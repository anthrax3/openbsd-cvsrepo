@Start of a driver for the "Active Protection System" accelerometer
found in recentish ThinkPads.

Sensors are reported via hw.sensors in sysctl but sensor numbers
and presence is likely to change.  Units and use of all of the
sensors is not yet known as IBM has not released any documentation.

Driver is based on information reverse engineered from the windows
driver by Anurag Sharma and Mark Smith.
