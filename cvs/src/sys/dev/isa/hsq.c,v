/*
 * This is OpenBSD driver for Hostess 4-channel serial mux -- hsq
 * ("hsq" stands for "HoStess Quad channel mux"; funny enough).
 *
 * Hostess may be the registered trademark of Comtrol Corp.
 * WARNING! The information that is below about Hostess family
 * serial cards is not based on any information from Comtrol, 
 * and I DON'T guarantee this information is authentic or right.
 * For authentic information on Hostess serial cards visit
 * http://www.comtrol.com
 *
 * Hostess mux is a very simple thing -- it's 4/8/16(?) UARTs one
 * after another, that share one IRQ. Under linux they may be used
 * with setserial, BSD systems are not so flexible with serial ports,
 * so i took ast driver and changed it, in the way i think Hostess
 * muxes should work. It works ifine with my mux (it has ti16c750
 * UARTs on it, and current com driver detects them as 550A, so i
 * changed it a bit, to use the power of 750).
 * 
 * Hostess cards use scratch register of lead UART to control the mux.
 * When a byte is written to the register it is meant as mask, which
 * enables/disables interrupts from 1-8 UARTs by setting 0-7 bits to
 * 1/0. Let us call this register UER -- UARTs Enable Register.
 * When a byte is read it is mask of bits for UARTs, that have some
 * event(s), which are analyzed using that UART's IIR. Let us call
 * this register UIR -- UARTs Interrrupt Register.
 *
 * Note: four higher bits of the UIR are alway 1 for 4-channel mux,
 * I have no idea what could that mean, it would be better to have
 * them zeroed.
 *
 * Shitty feature: UER's value upon power up is absolutely random,
 * so that UARTs can work and can not and you don't uderstand what's up...
 * Thus, we have to set its value to 0x0f to get all four UARTs 
 * interrupting, just after we've attached the mux...
 *
 * Use it and share my fun!
