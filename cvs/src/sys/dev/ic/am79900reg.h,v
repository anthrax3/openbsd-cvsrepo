log
@First pass at removing clauses 3 and 4 from NetBSD licenses.

Not sure what's more surprising: how long it took for NetBSD to
catch up to the rest of the BSDs (including UCB), or the amount of
code that NetBSD has claimed for itself without attributing to the
actual authors.

log
@New driver for the AMD PCnet-PCI family of Ethernet chips. This
driver uses direct DMA to mbufs (like other PCI network drivers,
and unlike the old "le at pci" driver), and also supports communication
with the MII-connected PHYs on the 10/100 boards.
