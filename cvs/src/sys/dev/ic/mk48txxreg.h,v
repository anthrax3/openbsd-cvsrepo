@TOD clock support for IOC3 flavours with DS174x chips (which are rebadged
MK48Txx). Entangled with preliminary changes which will hopefully eventually
lead to power(4) attaching on IP30 (but not finished yet).

@First pass at removing clauses 3 and 4 from NetBSD licenses.

Not sure what's more surprising: how long it took for NetBSD to
catch up to the rest of the BSDs (including UCB), or the amount of
code that NetBSD has claimed for itself without attributing to the
actual authors.
