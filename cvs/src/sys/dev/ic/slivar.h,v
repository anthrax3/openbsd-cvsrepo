@hook up interrupts, but a little different to what i usually do. this maps
the interrupt before the bus independant code is attached, and establishes
the interrupt after that.

@map the pci BARs that we're interested in. this gives us access to the
chips registers and io interface, but whats actually in them is still a
mystery to me.

@start work on a driver for emulex fibre channel controllers.

it is split up into a bus independant chunk (dev/ic/sli*) and the attach
glue (dev/pci/sli_pci.c) cos there are sbus varaints of this chip which i
hope to get my hands on one day.

this does nothing except attach to the LP8000 controllers.
