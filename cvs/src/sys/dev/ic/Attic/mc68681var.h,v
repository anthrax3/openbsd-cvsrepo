@Allow for an out-of-softc indirection to reach the software copy of the
important (and write-only) register state; this will allow this driver to
be used as a console before it attaches, to be used shortly.

1.1
log
@Overhaul the {aviion,mvme68k,mvme88k} dart(4) driver and move the truly
machine-independent parts to MI land.
The MI code now allow MD configuration of the various input and output ports,
to allow for proper DCD/RTS/DTR monitoring and control. It will also allow
the second set of baud rates to be used (when possible, i.e. if both ports
can use the same BRG), allowing for 38400 bps mode.
