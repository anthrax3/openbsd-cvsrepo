@vgafb is removed, was only used on powerpc, and is not in a state to
be an MI device. This old version was based on old wscons and will not build.

@Working with three different cards now. CL 5434, Diamond Stealth 64, and
Matrox Storm. _should_ be set up to support X, however no server available

1.1
log
@add wscons support to powerpc port.
This contains several pieces of the port
MI:
    vgafb, on powerpc under openfirmware the vga card comes up in gfx mode.
    instead of resetting it to text mode, vgafb treats this as a raster
    display. The mechanism used may not have been the best, it's
    interface to wscons is as a text display, and it does the character
    plotting itself.
    font_8x16.c was stolen from the atari port for use.

MD:
    ppcppi support stolen from alpha
    pms.c, pckbd.c and the rest of the support files were
    used nearly directly.

    powerpc
      conf.c to support wscon, vga/kbd
      machdep.c hack to get around a bus_space_set_region,bus_space_copy error.
      ofw_machdep.c some hack code on the road to supporting wscons as console.
