Tom: I did not commit a couple of your changes.

i did not include some punctuation fixes (full stops, etc.)
mnemorable -> mnemonic: i decided memorable was probably better

@Merge in -current from two days ago in the SMP branch.
As usual with merges, they do not indicate progress, so do not hold
your breath for working SMP, and do not mail me and ask about the
state of it.  It has not changed.  There is work ongoing, but very, very
slowly.  The commit is done in parts as to not lock up the tree in too
big chunks at a time.
