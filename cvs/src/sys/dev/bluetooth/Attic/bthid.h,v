@"It's not the years, honey; it's the mileage."

bluetooth support doesn't work and isn't going anywhere. the current
design is a dead end, and should not be the basis for any future support.
general consensus says to whack it so as to not mislead the unwary.

@Commiting for xsa@@ who dosent want to for some reason. He has KNFed and
de-proplibed some of the netbsd bluetooth drives for HID devices
(mice and keyboards) they will however NOT BUILD YET as they lack the
glue device bthidev and our replacement for the problib.

no objections from uwe
