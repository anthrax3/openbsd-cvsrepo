@First pass at removing clauses 3 and 4 from NetBSD licenses.

Not sure what's more surprising: how long it took for NetBSD to
catch up to the rest of the BSDs (including UCB), or the amount of
code that NetBSD has claimed for itself without attributing to the
actual authors.

@from netbsd;
New generic disk framework.  Highlights:
New metrics handling.  Metrics are now kept in the new `struct disk'.
Busy time is now stored as a timeval, and transfer count in bytes.
Storage for disklabels is now dynamically allocated, so that the size
of the disk structure is not machine-dependent.
Several new functions for attaching and detaching disks, and handling
metrics calculation.
Old-style instrumentation is still supported in drivers that did it
before.  However, old-style instrumentation is being deprecated, and
will go away once the userland utilities are updated for the new
framework.
For usage and architectural details, see the forthcoming disk(9)
manual page.
