1.3
log
@UTF-8 support for wsdisplay emulation modes. Both vt100 and sun emulation
will now recognize xterm-compatible escape sequences ESC % G and ESC % @@ to
enter and leave UTF-8 mode, respectively.

Not enabled on SMALL_KERNEL.

Most of this written during c2k7, completed during b2k13.

Note that the value of several international keysyms change, to switch from
ISO Latin-[257] values to the real Unicode values. Be sure to update your
includes and rebuild and install wsconsctl.

 * This file contains the logic used to enable several optional features

 *
 * HAVE_WSMOUSED_SUPPORT
 *	defined to enable support for wsmoused(8)
 * HAVE_BURNER_SUPPORT
 *	defined to enable screen blanking functionnality, controlled by
 *	wsconsctl(8)
 * HAVE_SCROLLBACK_SUPPORT
 *	defined to enable xterm-like shift-PgUp scrollback if the underlying
 *	wsdisplay supports this
 * HAVE_JUMP_SCROLL
 *	defined to enable jump scroll in the textmode emulation code
 * HAVE_UTF8_SUPPORT
 *	defined to enable UTF-8 mode and escape sequences in the textmode
 *	emulation code
 * HAVE_RESTARTABLE_EMULOPS
 *	defined to disable most of the restartable emulops code (to be used
 *	only if all wsdisplay drivers are compliant, i.e. no udl(4) in the
 *	kernel configuration)

1.2
log
@Add a conditional to disable most of the `abort state' code in the emulation
code. Enable this if SMALL_KERNEL, since this code is currently only really
needed for udl(4) which is not on any tight (SMALL_KERNEL) installation media.

1.1
log
@Introduce a dedicated private header file to control the optional features
of wscons (which usually get disabled for installation kernels, to save
space), instead of duplicating parts of it to too many places.

No functional change.
