@Add support for em(4) on Teak 3020, a Tolopai (EP80579)
based devices. This introduces Realtek PHY into em driver
code and is only a temporary solution to the problem.

1.1
log
@Add support for em(4) interfaces found on intel EP80579 SoC. The MAC part is
basicly 82545, but the PHY's are separated form the chip and they are accessed
through a special PCI device called GCU which has the MDIO interface. Since
there is no direct relationship between MAC and PHY, so for the moment they
are assigned to each other the way its done on Axiomtek NA-200, that was
danted to us by them.

This also adds a device driver for the GCU.

tested by me on Axiomtek board
