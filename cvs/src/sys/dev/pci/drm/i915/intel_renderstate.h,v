1.1
log
@Update inteldrm(4) to code based on Linux 4.4.70.  This brings us support for
Skylake and Cherryview and better support for Broadwell and Valleyview.  Also
adds MST support.  Some tweaks to the TTM code and radeondrm(4) to keep it
working with the updated generic DRM code needed for inteldrm(4).

Tested by many.
