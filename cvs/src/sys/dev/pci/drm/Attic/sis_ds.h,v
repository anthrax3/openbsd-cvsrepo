@sisdrm is disabled. That does not mean that the code doesn't offend me.

This driver is a very thin wrapper for doling out memory to userland,
everything else is handled by the userland drivers, therefore I really
want to rewrite this driver before even thinking about enabling it,
userland mapping graphics registers makes it hard for me to sleep at
night.

Anyway, remove a huge pile of scary code by switching the memory
allocation ioctls to user the drm_heap.c code instead of the very
complicated mess that it uses right now, probably saves some space, too.

Turns out linux made some similar (but far from identical) changes ages ago,
They did more, that may come later.

log
@Initial import of the DRM (direct rendering manager).

This is the kernel part necessary for DRI support in X. Disabled for now
because it still has a few bugs, but now I can work on it in tree. Also
requires the requisite bits in X, which are currently under discussion
on how to deal with them with privsep. ported from a combination of the
free and netbsd implementations.

Known bugs:
1) only the first occurence of X in any session will have dri, after
that something prevents it working.
2) if the machine does not have a dri capable card, the kernel panics.
Something's up in one of the probe functions. I haven't been able to
find it though.
3) radeon cards need to be forced to use PCI mode otherwise they get
into an infinite loop.

This is known to at least kinda work with SiS, radeons in pci mode and
intel cards.

ok deraadt, kinda ok art, a few other people had a quick look.
