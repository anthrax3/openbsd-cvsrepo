@Rip out the drm_drawable support. There is no need for the xserver to
push cliprects into the kernel anymore so no op the ioctls. The only
consumer of this information died a couple of months ago.

When i've got removal of these calls from userland upstream i'm going to
remove them from the interface entirely.

@Update to DRM git as of a few days ago. This mostly affects the
card-specific files with a few minor changes elsewhere.

The main change to the OpenBSD specific stuff is the change to the irq
api due to the vblank rework.

4 more large bugs known, I have a fix for one.

Tested by many.  prompted by deraadt@@.
