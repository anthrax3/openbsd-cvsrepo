@Remove the (unworking to the point it doens't even compile) viadrm driver.

Eventually a drm driver for via hardware may be written, but it will be
utterly different to this one.

No one objected, ok matthieu@@.

@Initial import of the DRM (direct rendering manager).

This is the kernel part necessary for DRI support in X. Disabled for now
because it still has a few bugs, but now I can work on it in tree. Also
requires the requisite bits in X, which are currently under discussion
on how to deal with them with privsep. ported from a combination of the
free and netbsd implementations.

Known bugs:
1) only the first occurence of X in any session will have dri, after
that something prevents it working.
2) if the machine does not have a dri capable card, the kernel panics.
Something's up in one of the probe functions. I haven't been able to
find it though.
3) radeon cards need to be forced to use PCI mode otherwise they get
into an infinite loop.

This is known to at least kinda work with SiS, radeons in pci mode and
intel cards.

ok deraadt, kinda ok art, a few other people had a quick look.
