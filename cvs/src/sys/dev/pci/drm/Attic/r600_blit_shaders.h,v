@Add a port of the TTM and Radeon DRM code from Linux 3.8.13.
Includes kernel modesetting, framebuffer console and support
for newer hardware.

Firmware needs to be present for acceleration and in some cases
modesetting to work.  It can be installed via fw_update
or manually via pkg_add.

With lots of help from kettenis@@ some macppc bits from mpi@@
and some ttm refcount/queue bits from FreeBSD.

Thanks to M:Tier and the OpenBSD Foundation for sponsoring this work.

@DRM for R600 and R700 chipsets.

note, only the pcidevs for those chipsets that have been tested are
enabled for now. Please contact me if you have a r600 or r700 that does
not attach radeondrm. Only the 2D/Xv bits are here. I'm ambivalent about
the implementation of the RADEON_CS ioctl for OpenGL since that was
originally kernel-modesetting only. When we update mesa I shall think
about (and test) it.

Tested by quite a number. Zero bad reports. Nagged perpetually by
robert@@ (and probably others) for months now.
