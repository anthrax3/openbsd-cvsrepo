@Remove the drm drivers that are not enabled (and have never been so).

For now they are unmaintained, and work on kernel modesetting has very
large inferface changes needing to be made. Also, when the radeon driver
has been converted over, we will no longer support X with the DRI1
protocol, only DRI2.

When the upheaval has finished, these drivers may be brought back after
work to switch them to DRI2 style memory management and kernel
modesetting has been done, but until then they are unsupported and
probably broken (i know at least two of them have been reported broken
before now). ragedrm will likely come back as a component of radeon
(their interfaces are still fairly similar). The other drivers require
rewriting.

I have been threatening to do this for over a year. Discussed with
deraadt@@ and matthieu@@ at various points since then.

@Initial import of the DRM (direct rendering manager).

This is the kernel part necessary for DRI support in X. Disabled for now
because it still has a few bugs, but now I can work on it in tree. Also
requires the requisite bits in X, which are currently under discussion
on how to deal with them with privsep. ported from a combination of the
free and netbsd implementations.

Known bugs:
1) only the first occurence of X in any session will have dri, after
that something prevents it working.
2) if the machine does not have a dri capable card, the kernel panics.
Something's up in one of the probe functions. I haven't been able to
find it though.
3) radeon cards need to be forced to use PCI mode otherwise they get
into an infinite loop.

This is known to at least kinda work with SiS, radeons in pci mode and
intel cards.

ok deraadt, kinda ok art, a few other people had a quick look.
