@Remove the drm drivers that are not enabled (and have never been so).

For now they are unmaintained, and work on kernel modesetting has very
large inferface changes needing to be made. Also, when the radeon driver
has been converted over, we will no longer support X with the DRI1
protocol, only DRI2.

When the upheaval has finished, these drivers may be brought back after
work to switch them to DRI2 style memory management and kernel
modesetting has been done, but until then they are unsupported and
probably broken (i know at least two of them have been reported broken
before now). ragedrm will likely come back as a component of radeon
(their interfaces are still fairly similar). The other drivers require
rewriting.

I have been threatening to do this for over a year. Discussed with
deraadt@@ and matthieu@@ at various points since then.

@Make all drm drivers map their mmio register space on attach instead of
using the drm_maps interface (this was done for inteldrm a few days
ago).  All drivers now ignore the mmio_offset argument that the init
ioctl takes.

This clears up the code and makes sure that drm_ioremap_core() doesn't
need the vga_pci_map inteface anymore, so we don't have to pass in the
vga softc anymore. We also get to kill the drm_resource_{start,length}
linux-alike functions since we just calculate all the requisite offsets
at startup and cache those we need. This now means that technically the
only driver that needs the vga_pci_map api is inteldrm (due to sharing
with intagp issues), though this diff doesn't convert them over.

@Move the drm drivers over from:

i.e. a similar scheme to audio(4) where the interface attaches on top of
the wildly different drivers. This helps to clean up the code a lot
(more is coming) and help me start to move drm to being essentially bus
independent, which will help in the future.

@rework how we handle ioctls.

Before it was based on a static array with flags. Instead, let the

Makes the code a bit easier to read, and also drops just over 5k on an
amd64 kernel build with all drm drivers enabled.

@Initial import of the DRM (direct rendering manager).

This is the kernel part necessary for DRI support in X. Disabled for now
because it still has a few bugs, but now I can work on it in tree. Also
requires the requisite bits in X, which are currently under discussion
on how to deal with them with privsep. ported from a combination of the
free and netbsd implementations.

Known bugs:
1) only the first occurence of X in any session will have dri, after
that something prevents it working.
2) if the machine does not have a dri capable card, the kernel panics.
Something's up in one of the probe functions. I haven't been able to
find it though.
3) radeon cards need to be forced to use PCI mode otherwise they get
into an infinite loop.

This is known to at least kinda work with SiS, radeons in pci mode and
intel cards.

ok deraadt, kinda ok art, a few other people had a quick look.
