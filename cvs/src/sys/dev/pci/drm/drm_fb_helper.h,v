@Update inteldrm to the code from Linux 3.14.52 (which corresponds to
commit 48f8f36a6c8018c2b36ea207aaf68ef5326c5075 on the linux-3.14.y
branch of the linux-stable tree).  This brings preliminary support for
the GPU on Intel's Broadwell CPUs.  Don't expect these to work
perfectly yet.  There are some remaining issues with older hardware as
well, but no significant regressions have been uncovered.

This also updates some of drm core code.  The radeondrm code remains
based on Linux 3.8 with some minimal canges to adjust to changes in
the core drm APIs.

Joint effort with jsg@@, who did the initial update of the relevant drm
core bits.  Committing this early to make sure it gets more testing
and make it possible for others to help getting the remaining wrinkles
straightened out.

@Add a port of the TTM and Radeon DRM code from Linux 3.8.13.
Includes kernel modesetting, framebuffer console and support
for newer hardware.

Firmware needs to be present for acceleration and in some cases
modesetting to work.  It can be installed via fw_update
or manually via pkg_add.

With lots of help from kettenis@@ some macppc bits from mpi@@
and some ttm refcount/queue bits from FreeBSD.

Thanks to M:Tier and the OpenBSD Foundation for sponsoring this work.

@Significantly increase the wordlist for ddb hangman,
and update our device independent DRM code and the Intel DRM code
to be mostly in sync with Linux 3.8.3.  Among other things this
brings support for kernel modesetting and enables use of
the rings on gen6+ Intel hardware.

Based on some earlier work from matthieu@@ with some hints from FreeBSD
and with lots of help from kettenis@@ (including a beautiful accelerated
wscons framebuffer console!)

Thanks to M:Tier and the OpenBSD Foundation for sponsoring this work.
