@Update to DRM git.

Some stability fixes for radeon. The most part of this diff is related
to fixing up the VBLANK (vertical blank interrupt) handling. Now, if the
X driver supports the DRM_IOCTL_MODESET_CTL ioctl, (to be used when
changing the video modes), then allow the vblank to be disabled once
that ioctl has been called. Otherwise, keep the interrupt enabled at all
time, since disabling it otherwise will lead to problems.

Tested by a few. "no problem" on API/ABI deraadt@@.

1.1
log
@Initial import of the DRM (direct rendering manager).

This is the kernel part necessary for DRI support in X. Disabled for now
because it still has a few bugs, but now I can work on it in tree. Also
requires the requisite bits in X, which are currently under discussion
on how to deal with them with privsep. ported from a combination of the
free and netbsd implementations.

Known bugs:
1) only the first occurence of X in any session will have dri, after
that something prevents it working.
2) if the machine does not have a dri capable card, the kernel panics.
Something's up in one of the probe functions. I haven't been able to
find it though.
3) radeon cards need to be forced to use PCI mode otherwise they get
into an infinite loop.

This is known to at least kinda work with SiS, radeons in pci mode and
intel cards.

ok deraadt, kinda ok art, a few other people had a quick look.
