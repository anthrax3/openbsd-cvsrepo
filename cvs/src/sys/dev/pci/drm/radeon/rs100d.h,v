1.1
log
@Add a port of the TTM and Radeon DRM code from Linux 3.8.13.
Includes kernel modesetting, framebuffer console and support
for newer hardware.

Firmware needs to be present for acceleration and in some cases
modesetting to work.  It can be installed via fw_update
or manually via pkg_add.

With lots of help from kettenis@@ some macppc bits from mpi@@
and some ttm refcount/queue bits from FreeBSD.

Thanks to M:Tier and the OpenBSD Foundation for sponsoring this work.
