log
@Move amas device from arch/amd64 to dev/pci and enable it in i386 as well.
amas defaults to disabled on both amd64 and i386.

/*
 * Device: amas (AMD memory access/address switch).
 *
 * Driver for the amd athlon/opteron 64 address map.
 * This device is integrated in 64-bit Athlon and Opteron cpus
 * and contains mappings for memory to processor nodes.
 *
 * The AMD cpu can access memory in two ways: interleaved and non-interleaved.
 *
 * In interleaved mode, 16 MB regions are rotated across each node,
 * example for 2 nodes:
 * - region 0 (0-16 MB) on node 0.
 * - region 1 (16-32 MB) on node 1.
 * - region 2 (33-48 MB) on node 0.
 * - region 3 (48-64 MB) on node 1.
 * ...
 * - region 2 * N on node 0.
 * - region 2 * N + 1 on node 1.
 * Interleaved mode requires that each node has the same amount of physical
 * memory.
 *
 * In non-interleaved mode, memory for each node is a continuous address space,
 * example for 2 nodes:
 * - region 0 (all memory on CPU package 0) on node 0.
 * - region 1 (all memory on CPU package 1) on node 1.
 * Non-interleaved mode requires either that each node has the same amount of
 * physical memory or that memory holes are allowed between each node.
 *
 * Configuring memory for interleaved or non-interleaved mode is handled by
 * the BIOS.
