@First pass at removing clauses 3 and 4 from NetBSD licenses.

Not sure what's more surprising: how long it took for NetBSD to
catch up to the rest of the BSDs (including UCB), or the amount of
code that NetBSD has claimed for itself without attributing to the
actual authors.

OK deraadt@@

@sbus_establish() and the associated linked list in the sbus softc is now only
used to store a per-device reset callback, for use in sbusreset(). Except
sbusreset() has never, ever, been used since Torek's sbus code went in.
Time to recycle those wasted bits.
