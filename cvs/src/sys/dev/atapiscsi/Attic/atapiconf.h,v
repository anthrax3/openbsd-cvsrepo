Use wdc_select_drive if we're starting in the IDLE bus state.

Modify the ATAPI reset state machine. Added two states, IDENTIFY and
IDENTIFY_WAIT. These will revive ATAPI drives after a hard ATA reset.

I don't think ATAPI devices have LUNs, so flag SDEV_NOLUNS as quirk
of the SCSI adapter. The SCSI devices will "inherit" this setting from
the parent.

Correctly deal with 16-byte command packet devices (not that any
exists, AFAIK).

Optimization - don't poll devices that assert an interrupt on after
sending PACKET cmd.
