@So long, uvm_pglist.h

This header defined three thing. two of which are unused throughout the tree,
the final one was the definition of the pagq head type, move that to uvm_page.h
and nuke the header

@First pass at removing clauses 3 and 4 from NetBSD licenses.

Not sure what's more surprising: how long it took for NetBSD to
catch up to the rest of the BSDs (including UCB), or the amount of
code that NetBSD has claimed for itself without attributing to the
actual authors.

OK deraadt@@

@UBC was a disaster. It worked very good when it worked, but on some
machines or some configurations or in some phase of the moon (we actually
don't know when or why) files disappeared. Since we've not been able to
track down the problem in two weeks intense debugging and we need -current
to be stable, back out everything to a state it had before UBC.

We apologise for the inconvenience.

@Yet another sync to NetBSD uvm.
Today we add a pmap argument to pmap_update() and allocate map entries for
kernel_map from kmem_map instead of using the static entries. This should
get rid of MAX_KMAPENT panics. Also some uvm_loan problems are fixed.
