@release the file ref to the kqueue while in kevent(), so that close()
can terminate.  a new ref on the kqueue itself allows us to free it
properly in that case.  wakeups were missing too (for both kevent and poll).
similar to netbsd pr46248. fixes a number of threaded ports.
this version of the fix from matthew.
ok tedu guenther matthew
