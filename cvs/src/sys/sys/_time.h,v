@Switch time_t, ino_t, clock_t, and struct kevent's ident and data
members to 64bit types.  Assign new syscall numbers for (almost
all) the syscalls that involve the affected types, including anything
with time_t, timeval, itimerval, timespec, rusage, dirent, stat,
or kevent arguments.  Add a d_off member to struct dirent and replace
getdirentries() with getdents(), thus immensely simplifying and
accelerating telldir/seekdir.  Build perl with -DBIG_TIME.

Bump the major on every single base library: the compat bits included
here are only good enough to make the transition; the T32 compat
option will be burned as soon as we've reached the new world are
are happy with the snapshots for all architectures.

DANGER: ABI incompatibility.  Updating to this kernel requires extra
work or you won't be able to login: install a snapshot instead.

Much assistance in fixing userland issues from deraadt@@ and tedu@@
and build assistance from todd@@ and otto@@

@Recongnize that:

* strptime(3) was introduced in XPG 4.0
* clock_gettime(3) and friends were introduced in 1003.1b-1993
* asctime_r(3) and friends were introduced in 1003.1c-1995

and conditionally provide prototypes and associated types accordingly.
This makes our <time.h> standards compliant except for some functions that are
still missing.

@Once more the people behind POSIX didn't think and put clock_gettime(2) and
friends in <time.h>.  The kernel needs access to the associated #defines, but
can't get them from <time.h>, so introduce a new header <sys/_time.h> and
include that from <time.h> for userland and <sys/time.h> for the kernel.
