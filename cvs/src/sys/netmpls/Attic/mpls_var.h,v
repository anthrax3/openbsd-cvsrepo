@Import MPLS (Multi Protocol Label Switching)

MPLS support partly based on the (abandoned?) AYAME project.
Basic LSR (Label Switch Router) functionality is present, but not fully
functional yet.

It is currently possible to insert entries in the LIB (Label Information Base)
with route(8), but setting the operation type is not supported yet.

Imported to allow more people to work on this in the coming weeks.
