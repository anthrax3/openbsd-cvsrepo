pdksh is provided AS IS, with NO WARRANTY, either expressed or implied.

The vast majority of the code that makes pdksh is in the public domain.
The exceptions are:
	sigact.c and sigact.h
		[REMOVED]
	aclocal.m4
		[REMOVED]

That's it.  Short and simple.

		This is covered by the GNU General Public Licence (GPL)
		as it contains modified versions of macros that come with
		GNU autoconf.  As this is used solely for configuration,
		the pdksh code itself is not covered by the GPL.
		The following is taken from autoconf 2.x documentation
		(info autoconf questions distributing) concerning use
		of autoconf in programs:

		   There are no restrictions on how the configuration
		   scripts that Autoconf produces may be distributed
		   or used.  In Autoconf version 1, they were covered by
		   the GNU General Public License.  We still encourage
		   software authors to distribute their work under terms
		   like those of the GPL, but doing so is not required
		   to use Autoconf.
