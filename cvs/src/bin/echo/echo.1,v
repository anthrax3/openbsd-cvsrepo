.Dt ECHO 1
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm echo
.Nd write arguments to the standard output
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm echo
.Op Fl n
.Op Ar string ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility writes any specified operands, separated by single blank
.Pq Sq \ \&
characters and followed by a newline
.Pq Sq \en
character, to the standard
output.
.Pp
When no operands are given, only the newline is written.
The -- operand,
which generally denotes an end to option processing,
is treated as part of
.Ar string .
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl n
Do not print the trailing newline character.
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std echo
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr csh 1 ,
.Xr ksh 1 ,
.Xr printf 1
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Nm
utility is compliant with the
.St -p1003.1-2008
specification.
.Pp
The flag
.Op Fl n
conflicts with the behaviour mandated by the
X/Open System Interfaces option of the
.St -p1003.1-2008
specification,
which says it should be treated as part of
.Ar string .
Additionally,
.Nm
does not support any of the backslash character sequences mandated by XSI.
.Pp
.Nm
also exists as a built-in to
.Xr csh 1
and
.Xr ksh 1 ,
though with a different syntax.
.Pp
Where portability is paramount, use
.Xr printf 1 .
.Sh HISTORY
An
.Nm
utility appeared in
.At v2 .

@i saw the previous was wrong as soon as i committed it: put the
built-in blurb in STANDARDS; we did once have a COMPATIBILITY section
which we merged with STANDARDS, so i think this is appropriate. it
certainly feels better than adding single sentences randomly to the
end of text bodies.
