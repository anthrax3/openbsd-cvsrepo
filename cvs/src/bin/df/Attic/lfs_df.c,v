@New struct statfs with mount options.  NOTE: this replaces statfs(2),
fstatfs(2), and getfsstat(2) so you will need to build a new kernel
before doing a "make build" or you will get "unimplemented syscall" errors.

The new struct statfs has the following featuires:
o Has a u_int32_t flags field--now softdep can have a real flag.

o Uses u_int32_t instead of longs (nicer on the alpha).  Note: the man
page used to lie about setting invalid/unused fields to -1.  SunOS does
that but our code never has.

o Gets rid of f_type completely.  It hasn't been used since NetBSD 0.9
and having it there but always 0 is confusing.  It is conceivable
that this may cause some old code to not compile but that is better
than silently breaking.

o Adds a mount_info union that contains the FSTYPE_args struct.  This
means that "mount" can now tell you all the options a filesystem was
mounted with.  This is especially nice for NFS.

Other changes:
o The linux statfs emulation didn't convert between BSD fs names
  and linux f_type numbers.  Now it does, since the BSD f_type
  number is useless to linux apps (and has been removed anyway)

o FreeBSD's struct statfs is different from our (both old and new)
and thus needs conversion.  Previously, the OpenBSD syscalls
were used without any real translation.

o mount(8) will now show extra info when invoked with no arguments.
However, to see *everything* you need to use the -v (verbose) flag.

@Better support for unmounted filesystems (i.e. df /dev/rsd0a):
- interpret the superblock of lfs, ext2fs, and ffs filesystems.
- never mount() an offline filesystem, always read its superblock.
- use the same algorithm as statfs() for ffs, get the same answers.

  Even so, now I'm really unsure this code should remain in df.
  Similar functionality should be added to dumpfs or fsck instead.
