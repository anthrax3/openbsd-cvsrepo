This paper is meant to help
secretaries, typists and programmers
to make effective use of the
.UX
facilities
for preparing and editing text.
It provides explanations and examples of
.IP \(bu
special characters, line addressing, and global commands in the editor
.UL ed ;
.IP \(bu
commands for ``cut and paste'' operations on files
and parts of files,
including the
.UL mv ,
.UL cp ,
.UL cat ,
and
.UL rm
commands,
and the
.UL r ,
.UL w ,
.UL m ,
and
.UL t
commands of the editor;
.IP \(bu
editing scripts and
editor-based programs like
.UL grep
and
.UL sed .
.PP
Although the treatment is aimed
at non-programmers,
new
UNIX
users
with any background
should find helpful hints
on how to get their jobs done
more easily.
