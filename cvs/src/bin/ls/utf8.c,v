1.2
log
@Fix a regression (and POSIX violation) introduced with UTF-8 support:
When neither running on a terminal nor with -q, names must be passed
through as they are, nothing must be replaced with question marks.
Effectively, -q was always in effect.  SMALL was not affected.

Triggered by a different patch from Martijn van Duren <openbsd plus tech
at list dot imperialat dot at>, who confirmed that this version is better.
Identified as a regression by tedu@@.
OK sthen@@.

log
@Support UTF-8: use wcwidth(3) for column adjustment and replace
non-printable Unicode codepoints and invalid bytes with ASCII
question marks.  No change for the SMALL version.

Using ideas developed by tedu@@, phessler@@, bentley@@ and feedback from many.
OK yasuoka@@ czarkoff@@ sthen@@.
