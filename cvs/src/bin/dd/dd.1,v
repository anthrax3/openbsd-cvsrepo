.Sh NAME
.Nm dd
.Nd convert and copy a file
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm dd
.Op Ar operand ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility copies the standard input to the standard output, applying any
specified conversions.
Input data is read and written in 512-byte blocks.
If input reads are short, input from multiple reads are aggregated
to form the output block.
When finished,
.Nm
displays the number of complete and partial input and output blocks
and truncated input records to the standard error output.
.Pp
The following operands are available:
.Bl -tag -width of=file
.It Cm if= Ns Ar file
Read input from
.Ar file
instead of the standard input.
.It Cm of= Ns Ar file
Write output to
.Ar file
instead of the standard output.
Any regular output file is truncated unless the
.Cm notrunc
conversion value is specified.
If an initial portion of the output file is skipped (see the
.Cm seek
operand),
the output file is truncated at that point.
.It Cm ibs= Ns Ar n
Set the input block size to
.Ar n
bytes instead of the default 512.
.It Cm obs= Ns Ar n
Set the output block size to
.Ar n
bytes instead of the default 512.
.It Cm bs= Ns Ar n
Set both the input and output block size to
.Ar n
bytes, superseding the
.Cm ibs
and
.Cm obs
operands.
If no conversion values other than
.Cm noerror ,
.Cm notrunc ,
or
.Cm sync
are specified, then each input block is copied to the output as a
single block without any aggregation of short blocks.
.It Cm cbs= Ns Ar n
Set the conversion record size to
.Ar n
bytes.
The conversion record size is required by the record oriented conversion
values.
.It Cm count= Ns Ar n
Copy only
.Ar n
input blocks.
.It Cm files= Ns Ar n
Copy
.Ar n
input files before terminating.
This operand is only applicable when the input device is a tape.
.It Cm seek= Ns Ar n
Seek
.Ar n
blocks from the beginning of the output before copying.
On non-tape devices, an
.Xr lseek 2
operation is used.
Otherwise, existing blocks are read and the data discarded.
If the user does not have read permission for the tape, it is positioned
using the tape
.Xr ioctl 2
function calls.
If the seek operation is past the end of file, space from the current
end of file to the specified offset is filled with blocks of NUL bytes.
.It Cm skip= Ns Ar n
Skip
.Ar n
blocks from the beginning of the input before copying.
On input which supports seeks, an
.Xr lseek 2
operation is used.
Otherwise, input data is read and discarded.
For pipes, the correct number of bytes is read.
For all other devices, the correct number of blocks is read without
distinguishing between a partial or complete block being read.
.It Xo
.Sm off
.Cm status= Ar value
.Sm on
.Xc
Where
.Ar value
is one of the symbols from the following list.
.Bl -tag -width unblock
.It Cm noxfer
Do not print the transfer statistics as the last line of status output.
.It Cm none
Do not print the status output.
Error messages are shown; informational messages are not.
.El
.It Xo
.Sm off
.Cm conv= Ar value Oo ,
.Sm on
.Ar value ... Oc
.Xc
Where
.Ar value
is one of the symbols from the following list.
.Bl -tag -width unblock
.It Cm ascii
The same as the
.Cm unblock
value except that characters are translated from EBCDIC to ASCII
before the records are converted.
(These values imply
.Cm unblock
if the operand
.Cm cbs
is also specified.)
.It Cm block
Treats the input as a sequence of newline or end-of-file terminated variable
length records independent of input and output block boundaries.
Any trailing newline character is discarded.
Each input record is converted to a fixed length output record where the
length is specified by the
.Cm cbs
operand.
Input records shorter than the conversion record size are padded with spaces.
Input records longer than the conversion record size are truncated.
The number of truncated input records, if any, is reported to the standard
error output at the completion of the copy.
.It Cm ebcdic , ibm
The same as the
.Cm block
value except that characters are translated from ASCII to EBCDIC
after the records are converted.
(These values imply
.Cm block
if the operand
.Cm cbs
is also specified.)
There are two conversion maps for EBCDIC.
The value
.Cm ebcdic
specifies the recommended one which is compatible with
.At V .
The value
.Cm ibm
is a slightly different mapping, which is compatible with the
.At V
.Cm ibm
value.
.It Cm lcase
Transform uppercase characters into lowercase characters.
.It Cm noerror
Do not stop processing on an input error.
When an input error occurs, a diagnostic message followed by the current
input and output block counts will be written to the standard error output
in the same format as the standard completion message.
If the
.Cm sync
conversion is also specified, any missing input data will be replaced
with NUL bytes (or with spaces if a block oriented conversion value was
specified) and processed as a normal input buffer.
If the
.Cm sync
conversion is not specified, the input block is omitted from the output.
On input files which are not tapes or pipes, the file offset
will be positioned past the block in which the error occurred using
.Xr lseek 2 .
.It Cm notrunc
Do not truncate the output file.
This will preserve any blocks in the output file not explicitly written
by
.Nm dd .
The
.Cm notrunc
value is not supported for tapes.
.It Cm osync
Pad the final output block to the full output block size.
If the input file is not a multiple of the output block size
after conversion, this conversion forces the final output block
to be the same size as preceding blocks for use on devices that require
regularly sized blocks to be written.
This option is incompatible with use of the
.Cm bs= Ns Ar n
block size specification.
.It Cm swab
Swap every pair of input bytes.
If an input buffer has an odd number of bytes, the last byte will be
ignored during swapping.
.It Cm sync
Pad every input block to the input buffer size.
Spaces are used for pad bytes if a block oriented conversion value is
specified, otherwise NUL bytes are used.
.It Cm ucase
Transform lowercase characters into uppercase characters.
.It Cm unblock
Treats the input as a sequence of fixed length records independent of input
and output block boundaries.
The length of the input records is specified by the
.Cm cbs
operand.
Any trailing space characters are discarded and a newline character is
appended.
.El
.El
.Pp
Where sizes are specified, a decimal number of bytes is expected.
If the number ends with a
.Sq b ,
.Sq k
or
.Sq K ,
.Sq m
or
.Sq M ,
.Sq g
or
.Sq G ,
or
.Sq w ,
the number is multiplied by 512, 1024 (1K), 1048576 (1M), 1073741824 (1G),
or the number of bytes in an integer, respectively.
Two or more numbers may be separated by an
.Sq x
to indicate a product.
.Pp
When finished,
.Nm
displays the number of complete and partial input and output blocks,
truncated input records, and odd-length byte-swapping blocks to the
standard error output.
A partial input block is one where less than the input block size
was read.
A partial output block is one where less than the output block size
was written.
Partial output blocks to tape devices are considered fatal errors.
Otherwise, the rest of the block will be written.
Partial output blocks to character devices will produce a warning message.
A truncated input block is one where a variable length record oriented
conversion value was specified and the input line was too long to
fit in the conversion record or was not newline terminated.
.Pp
Normally, data resulting from input or conversion or both are aggregated
into output blocks of the specified size.
After the end of input is reached, any remaining output is written as
a block.
This means that the final output block may be shorter than the output
block size.
.Pp
If
.Nm
receives a
.Dv SIGINFO
(see the
.Dq status
argument for
.Xr stty 1 )
signal, the current input and output block counts will
be written to the standard error output
in the same format as the standard completion message.
If
.Nm
receives a
.Dv SIGINT
signal, the current input and output block counts will
be written to the standard error output
in the same format as the standard completion message and
.Nm
will exit.

.Sh STANDARDS

utility is compliant with the

and
.Cm ibm
are marked by
.St -p1003.1-2008
as being an
X/Open System Interfaces option.

conversion,
the
.Sq K ,
.Sq m ,
.Sq M ,
.Sq g ,
.Sq G ,
and

handling
are all extensions to the
.St -p1003.1-2008
specification.

log
@Add an operand to /bin/dd that suppresses the status lines printed
to stderr after transfer.  Use the GNU syntax status=noxfer and
status=none to make dd quiet.  The output is annoying in some
situations, so people redirect stderr to /dev/null.  This approach
also suppresses the error messages and bugs in shell scripts remain
undetected.  The new feature status=none is the better alternative.
