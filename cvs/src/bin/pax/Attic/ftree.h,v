@when pax is running in -u mode, and no files are beeing updated because
not one changed, we should not exit with an error but zero to indicate
success (matches solaris behaviour).
need to track wether files were skipped because of the -u checks for that
and take that into account later when taking the exit code decision.
ok theo, comments from otto and miod
