.Sh NAME
.Nm pwd
.Nd return working directory name
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm pwd
.Op Fl LP
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility prints the absolute pathname of the current working directory to
the standard output.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl L
If the
.Ev PWD
environment variable is an absolute pathname that references the
current directory and doesn't contain path components of "." or "..",
then
.Ev PWD
is printed as the name of the current directory.
Otherwise, act as if the
.Fl P
option was given.
.It Fl P
Print the physical path to the current working directory, with symbolic
links in the path resolved.
.El
.Pp
The
.Fl L
and
.Fl P
options override each other and the command's actions are determined
by the last one specified.
The default if no options are given is
.Fl P .
.Pp
For an explanation of the directory hierarchy,
see
.Xr hier 7 .
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width PWD
.It Ev PWD
The presumptive logical path to the current working directory.
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std pwd
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr ksh 1 ,
.Xr getcwd 3 ,
.Xr hier 7
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Nm
utility is compliant with the
.St -p1003.1-2008
specification,
except the standard says the default if no options are given
should be to behave as if
.Fl L
had been specified.
.Sh HISTORY
An
.Nm
utility appeared in
.At v5 .
Support for the
.Fl L
option was added in
.Ox 5.6 .
.Sh CAVEATS
.Nm
also exists as a built-in to
.Xr ksh 1 ,
which may have a different default behavior.

@In his continuing quest to improve our documentation, jmc@@ noticed that
we didn't support the -L option required by POSIX, and didn't
document the -P option that we did support.  Fix that with code and
doc bits from NetBSD, but correcting a minor noncompliance in the
-L support and applying the jmc@@ and sobrado@@ magic to the manpage.
This commit does not change the default behavior.

the command

@i saw the previous was wrong as soon as i committed it: put the
built-in blurb in STANDARDS; we did once have a COMPATIBILITY section
which we merged with STANDARDS, so i think this is appropriate. it
certainly feels better than adding single sentences randomly to the
end of text bodies.

@providing MLINKS for shell builtins makes little sense: what we had was out
of date for ever (no ksh builtins), and since we have two shells, pointing
to one page or the other is never going to work; so remove MLINKS for
csh(1); the cd(1) and wait(1) pages (also builtins); and update any trailing
Xr's;

please, there are tools like whence, man, and locate for finding this stuff;
