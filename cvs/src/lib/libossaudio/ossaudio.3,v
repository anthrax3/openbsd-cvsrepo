.Dt OSSAUDIO 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm ossaudio
.Nd OSS audio emulation
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In soundcard.h
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
library provides an emulation of the OSS (Linux) audio
interface.
.Pp
Use the native interface for new programs and the emulation
library only for porting programs.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr audio 4
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
library first appeared in
.Nx 1.3 .
.Sh BUGS
The emulation uses a #define for
.Fn ioctl
so some obscure programs
can fail to compile.
.Pp
The emulation is incomplete.
.Pp
The emulation only covers
.Fn ioctl ,
there are other differences as well.
E.g., on a write that would block in non-blocking mode Linux returns
.Dv EINTR
whereas
.Ox
returns
.Dv EAGAIN .

@First pass at removing clauses 3 and 4 from NetBSD licenses.

Not sure what's more surprising: how long it took for NetBSD to
catch up to the rest of the BSDs (including UCB), or the amount of
code that NetBSD has claimed for itself without attributing to the
actual authors.

@sync up libossaudio with NetBSD changes.
--
- Add __BEGIN_DECLS & __END_DECLS for C++
- Make protection against multiple inclusion non-invasive wrt. name space
- Use EAGAIN instead of EWOULDBLOCK.  The actual numeric value is
same, but EAGAIN is the posixly correct name
- Remove white space
- Change the behaviour to report emulated encodings, too
- Implement SOUND_MIXER_INFO
- Implement OSS_GETVERSION
- Accept mixer values above max (100)
- Handle the info from AUDIO_MIXER_DEVINFO properly, parts of it is opaque
- Use accurate rounding in conversion between OSS and OpenBSD volume values
- Map OSS mixer device "line1" to native mixer device "aux"

@- remove all trailing whitespace

- fix remaining .Nm usage as well
- this is from a patch I received from kwesterback@@home.com, who has been
  working on some scripts for fixing formatting errors in mdoc'd man pages

Ok, so there could be a cost/benefit debate with this commit, but since I have
the patch we might as well commit it...

@The proper order of the ``introductory'' macros in a man page is .Dd/.Dt/.Os.
Out of the approximately 1450 man pages, only about 90 of them were wrong.
Thanks to kwesterback@@home.com for coming up with a script and patch to repair
this. The patch also inserted a .Os macro in the few man pages that were
missing one.
