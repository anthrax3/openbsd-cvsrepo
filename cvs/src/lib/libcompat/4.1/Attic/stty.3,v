.Dt STTY 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm stty ,
.Nm gtty
.Nd set and get terminal state (defunct)
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sgtty.h
.Ft int
.Fn stty "int fd" "struct sgttyb *buf"
.Ft int
.Fn gtty "int fd" "struct sgttyb *buf"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Bf -symbolic
These interfaces are obsoleted by
.Xr ioctl 2 .
They are available from the compatibility library, libcompat.
.Ef
.Pp
The
.Fn stty
function
sets the state of the terminal associated with
.Fa fd .
The
.Fn gtty
function
retrieves the state of the terminal associated
with
.Fa fd .
To set the state of a terminal the call must have
write permission.
.Pp
The
.Fn stty
call is actually
.Ql ioctl(fd, TIOCSETP, buf) ,
while
the
.Fn gtty
call is
.Ql ioctl(fd, TIOCGETP, buf) .
See
.Xr ioctl 2
and
.Xr tty 4
for an explanation.
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
If the call is successful 0 is returned, otherwise \-1 is
returned and the global variable
.Va errno
contains the reason for the failure.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr ioctl 2 ,
.Xr tty 4
.Sh HISTORY
The systems calls
.Fn stty
and
.Fn gtty
existed since
.At v1 .
They were implemented in terms of
.Xr ioctl 2
since
.At v7
and finally moved as functions into the C library in
.Bx 4.1c .

@- remove all trailing whitespace
     * except when it is escaped with a `\' at the end of the line
- fix remaining .Nm usage as well
- this is from a patch I received from kwesterback@@home.com, who has been
  working on some scripts for fixing formatting errors in mdoc'd man pages

Ok, so there could be a cost/benefit debate with this commit, but since I have
the patch we might as well commit it...
