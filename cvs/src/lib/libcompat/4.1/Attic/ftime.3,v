.Sh NAME
.Nm ftime
.Nd get date and time
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/types.h
.In sys/timeb.h
.Ft int
.Fn ftime "struct timeb *tp"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Bf -symbolic
This interface is obsoleted by
.Xr gettimeofday 2 .
It is available from the compatibility library, libcompat.
.Ef
.Pp
The
.Fn ftime
routine fills in a structure pointed to by its argument,
as defined by
.Aq Pa sys/timeb.h :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
/*
 * Structure returned by ftime system call
 */
struct timeb
{
	  time_t  time;
	  unsigned short millitm;
	  short   timezone;
	  short   dstflag;
};
.Ed
.Pp
The structure contains the time since the Epoch in seconds,
up to 1000 milliseconds of more-precise interval,
the local time zone (measured in minutes of time westward from Greenwich),
and a flag that, if nonzero, indicates that
Daylight Saving time applies locally during the appropriate part of the year.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr gettimeofday 2 ,
.Xr settimeofday 2 ,
.Xr ctime 3 ,
.Xr time 3
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Fn ftime
system call first appeared in
.At v7 .

@- remove all trailing whitespace
     * except when it is escaped with a `\' at the end of the line
- fix remaining .Nm usage as well
- this is from a patch I received from kwesterback@@home.com, who has been
  working on some scripts for fixing formatting errors in mdoc'd man pages

Ok, so there could be a cost/benefit debate with this commit, but since I have
the patch we might as well commit it...
