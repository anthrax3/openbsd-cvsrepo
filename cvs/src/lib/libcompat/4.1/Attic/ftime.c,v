@express final disapproval of the interfaces in libcompat, such as
them ftime(), gtty(), stty(), re_comp(), cuserid() and others.
Discussion and ongoing work to fix the ports tree from many, especially
naddy.
ok naddy
[There is a bit more cleanup possible after that, but this is considered
the current safe step]

@rcsid[] and sccsid[] and copyright[] are essentially unmaintained (and
unmaintainable).  these days, people use source.  these id's do not provide
any benefit, and do hurt the small install media
(the 33,000 line diff is essentially mechanical)
ok with the idea millert, ok dms
