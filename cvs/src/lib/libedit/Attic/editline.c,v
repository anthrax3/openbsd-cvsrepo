@Enable separate compilation while keeping internal interfaces hidden.
Simplifies the build system and prevents modules
from stomping on each other's static symbols.

Based on a hint from guenther@@,
using feedback from kettenis@@ and deraadt@@.

@Replace the generated file "fcns.c" by a simpler header "func.h"
included only in the one file needing it, "map.c".
That allows to define el_action_t directly in "map.h",
which in turn allows to stop including "fcns.h" from "el.h"
and include it only in the modules needing it.
Now we no longer autogenerate any C files.

Feedback and OK martijn@@.
First version also proofread by Christian Heckendorf <mbie at ulmus dot me>.

@The files editline.c, historyn.c, and tokenizern.c are completely
constant and very short and simple.  Check them into CVS rather
than generating them at build time in a complicated way.
