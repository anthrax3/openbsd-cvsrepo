.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm SSL_set_fd ,
.Nm SSL_set_rfd ,
.Nm SSL_set_wfd
.Nd connect the SSL object with a file descriptor
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In openssl/ssl.h
.Ft int
.Fn SSL_set_fd "SSL *ssl" "int fd"
.Ft int
.Fn SSL_set_rfd "SSL *ssl" "int fd"
.Ft int
.Fn SSL_set_wfd "SSL *ssl" "int fd"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn SSL_set_fd
sets the file descriptor
.Fa fd
as the input/output facility for the TLS/SSL (encrypted) side of
.Fa ssl .
.Fa fd
will typically be the socket file descriptor of a network connection.
.Pp
When performing the operation, a socket
.Vt BIO
is automatically created to interface between the
.Fa ssl
and
.Fa fd .
The
.Vt BIO
and hence the SSL engine inherit the behaviour of
.Fa fd .
If
.Fa fd
is non-blocking, the
.Fa ssl
will also have non-blocking behaviour.
.Pp
If there was already a
.Vt BIO
connected to
.Fa ssl ,
.Xr BIO_free 3
will be called (for both the reading and writing side, if different).
.Pp
.Fn SSL_set_rfd
and
.Fn SSL_set_wfd
perform the respective action, but only for the read channel or the write
channel, which can be set independently.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The following return values can occur:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It 0
The operation failed.
Check the error stack to find out why.
.It 1
The operation succeeded.
