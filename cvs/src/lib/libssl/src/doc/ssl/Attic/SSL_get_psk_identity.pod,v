=head1 NAME

SSL_get_psk_identity, SSL_get_psk_identity_hint - get PSK client identity and
hint


=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/ssl.h>

 const char *SSL_get_psk_identity_hint(const SSL *ssl);
 const char *SSL_get_psk_identity(const SSL *ssl);


=head1 DESCRIPTION

SSL_get_psk_identity_hint() is used to retrieve the PSK identity hint
used during the connection setup related to SSL object
B<ssl>. Similarly, SSL_get_psk_identity() is used to retrieve the PSK
identity used during the connection setup.


=head1 RETURN VALUES

If non-B<NULL>, SSL_get_psk_identity_hint() returns the PSK identity
hint and SSL_get_psk_identity() returns the PSK identity. Both are
B<NULL>-terminated. SSL_get_psk_identity_hint() may return B<NULL> if
no PSK identity hint was used during the connection setup.

Note that the return value is valid only during the lifetime of the
SSL object B<ssl>.
