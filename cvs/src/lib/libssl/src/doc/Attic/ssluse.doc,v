@We have an SSL_CTX which contains global information for lots of
SSL connections.  The session-id cache and the certificate verificate cache.
It also contains default values for use when certificates are used.

SSL_CTX
	default cipher list
	session-id cache
	certificate cache
	default session-id timeout period
	New session-id callback
	Required session-id callback
	session-id stats
	Informational callback
	Callback that is set, overrides the SSLeay X509 certificate
	  verification
	The default Certificate/Private Key pair
	Default read ahead mode.
	Default verify mode and verify callback.  These are not used
	  if the over ride callback mentioned above is used.
	
Each SSL can have the following defined for it before a connection is made.

Certificate
Private key
Ciphers to use
Certificate verify mode and callback
IO object to use in the comunication.
Some 'read-ahead' mode information.
A previous session-id to re-use.

A connection is made by using SSL_connect or SSL_accept.
When non-blocking IO is being used, there are functions that can be used
to determin where and why the SSL_connect or SSL_accept did not complete.
This information can be used to recall the functions when the 'error'
condition has dissapeared.

After the connection has been made, information can be retrived about the
SSL session and the session-id values that have been decided apon.
The 'peer' certificate can be retrieved.

The session-id values include
'start time'
'timeout length'

@Import of SSLeay-0.9.0b with RSA and IDEA stubbed + OpenBSD build
functionality for shared libs.

Note that routines such as sslv2_init and friends that use RSA will
not work due to lack of RSA in this library.

Needs documentation and help from ports for easy upgrade to full
functionality where legally possible.
