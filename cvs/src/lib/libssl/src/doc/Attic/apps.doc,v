@The applications

Ok, where to begin....
In the begining, when SSLeay was small (April 1995), there
were but few applications, they did happily cohabit in
the one bin directory.  Then over time, they did multiply and grow,
and they started to look like microsoft software; 500k to print 'hello world'.
A new approach was needed.  They were coalessed into one 'Monolithic'
application, ssleay.  This one program is composed of many programs that
can all be compiled independantly.

ssleay has 3 modes of operation.
1) If the ssleay binaray has the name of one of its component programs, it
executes that program and then exits.  This can be achieve by using hard or
symbolic links, or failing that, just renaming the binary.
2) If the first argument to ssleay is the name of one of the component
programs, that program runs that program and then exits.
3) If there are no arguments, ssleay enters a 'command' mode.  Each line is
interpreted as a program name plus arguments.  After each 'program' is run,
ssleay returns to the comand line.

dgst	- message digests
enc	- encryption and base64 encoding

ans1parse - 'pulls' appart ASN.1 encoded objects like certificates.

dh	- Diffle-Hellman parameter manipulation.
rsa	- RSA manipulations.
crl	- Certificate revokion list manipulations
x509	- X509 cert fiddles, including signing.
pkcs7	- pkcs7 manipulation, only DER versions right now.

genrsa	- generate an RSA private key.
gendh	- Generate a set of Diffle-Hellman parameters.
req	- Generate a PKCS#10 object, a certificate request.

s_client - SSL client program
s_server - SSL server program
s_time	 - A SSL protocol timing program
s_mult	 - Another SSL server, but it multiplexes
	   connections.
s_filter - under development

errstr	- Convert SSLeay error numbers to strings.
ca	- Sign certificate requests, and generate
	  certificate revokion lists
crl2pkcs7 - put a crl and certifcates into a pkcs7 object.
speed	- Benchmark the ciphers.
verify	- Check certificates
hashdir - under development

[ there a now a few more options, play with the program to see what they
  are ]

1.1.1.1
log
@Import of SSLeay-0.9.0b with RSA and IDEA stubbed + OpenBSD build
functionality for shared libs.

Note that routines such as sslv2_init and friends that use RSA will
not work due to lack of RSA in this library.

Needs documentation and help from ports for easy upgrade to full
functionality where legally possible.
