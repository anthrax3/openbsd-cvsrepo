@This is a quick high level summery of how things work now.

Each SSLv2 and SSLv3 cipher is composed of 4 major attributes plus a few extra
minor ones.

They are 'The key exchange algorithm', which is RSA for SSLv2 but can also
be Diffle-Hellman for SSLv3.

An 'Authenticion algorithm', which can be RSA, Diffle-Helman, DSS or
none.

The cipher

The MAC digest.

A cipher can also be an export cipher and is either an SSLv2 or a
SSLv3 ciphers.

To specify which ciphers to use, one can either specify all the ciphers,
one at a time, or use 'aliases' to specify the preference and order for
the ciphers.

There are a large number of aliases, but the most importaint are
kRSA, kDHr, kDHd and kEDH for key exchange types.

aRSA, aDSS, aNULL and aDH for authentication
DES, 3DES, RC4, RC2, IDEA and eNULL for ciphers
MD5, SHA0 and SHA1 digests

Now where this becomes interesting is that these can be put together to
specify the order and ciphers you wish to use.

To speed this up there are also aliases for certian groups of ciphers.
The main ones are
SSLv2	- all SSLv2 ciphers
SSLv3	- all SSLv3 ciphers
EXP	- all export ciphers
LOW	- all low strngth ciphers (no export ciphers, normally single DES)
MEDIUM	- 128 bit encryption
HIGH	- Triple DES

These aliases can be joined in a : separated list which specifies to
add ciphers, move them to the current location and delete them.

A simpler way to look at all of this is to use the 'ssleay ciphers -v' command.
The default library cipher spec is
!ADH:RC4+RSA:HIGH:MEDIUM:LOW:EXP:+SSLv2:+EXP
which means, first, remove from consideration any ciphers that do not
authenticate.  Next up, use ciphers using RC4 and RSA.  Next include the HIGH,
MEDIUM and the LOW security ciphers.  Finish up by adding all the export
ciphers on the end, then 'pull' all the SSLv2 and export ciphers to
the end of the list.

The results are
$ ssleay ciphers -v '!ADH:RC4+RSA:HIGH:MEDIUM:LOW:EXP:+SSLv2:+EXP'

I would recoment people use the 'ssleay ciphers -v "text"'
command to check what they are going to use.

Anyway, I'm falling asleep here so I'll do some more tomorrow.

@Import of SSLeay-0.9.0b with RSA and IDEA stubbed + OpenBSD build
functionality for shared libs.

Note that routines such as sslv2_init and friends that use RSA will
not work due to lack of RSA in this library.

Needs documentation and help from ports for easy upgrade to full
functionality where legally possible.
