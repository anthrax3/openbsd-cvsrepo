@Remove the Broadcom ubsec engine:
The vendor_defns/hw_ubsec.h file has a copyright that does not grant rights!

Vendor files should either include a compatible license in the
copyright statement or use OpenSSL's defaults, but adding a copyright
statement without any terms is not acceptable.  It should not have
been included in the first place.

(The ubsec(4) kernel driver is not affected by this change)
