@Remove the cswift engine: it is not standalone and we don't have the
hardware.

The vendor_defns/cswift.h does not specify a copyright and
theoretically defaults to the OpenSSL license, but it also mentions
that it includes parts that have been "clipped" from CryptoSwift's
proprietary headers.  This file should better include an explicit
copyright statement or mention OpenSSL's library instead of the
ambiguous "Attribution notice".
