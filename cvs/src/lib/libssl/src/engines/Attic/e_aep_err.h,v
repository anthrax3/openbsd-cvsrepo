@Remove the AEP engine: it is not standalone and doesn't seem to be
relevant anymore.  OpenSSL should have a better way to include 3rd
party engines: either completely and free or external.  But including
a wrapper for a non-free wrapper in the code base does not make much
sense and could also be provided by the vendor.
