@Remove the Atalla engine: It is not standalone and depends on external
non-free libraries.  OpenSSL should have a better way to include 3rd
party engines: either completely free or external.  But including a
wrapper for a non-free wrapper in the code base does not make much
sense and could also be provided by the vendor.
