@- The loading of the netscape RC4 encrypted key is a crock of pig pellets.
  It will be reworked along with a nice general mechanism for encrypting
  ASN.1 stuff. [ Jun 96 ] I've cleaned up private keys internally but
  still have not done PKCS#8 support.

- Winsock support in s_client/s_server for windows nt/3.1 is a crock.
  I will probably not get this fixed for a while, it is just there so
  I could test things.

- Be able to generate DSS certificates.

- Add CRL to the X509 verification stuff, this will probably be added with
  SSLv3.

+ X509 callback.  I need to callback the application to retrieve certificates
  and CRL.

*<- designates the things I'm activly working on.
+<- designates that which I have next in the queue.

====

X509v3 extensions
verify certificate chains
X509 cert lookup methods
RSA/DSA/DH methods mostly for smart cards
dsa cert generation

@Import of SSLeay-0.9.0b with RSA and IDEA stubbed + OpenBSD build
functionality for shared libs.

Note that routines such as sslv2_init and friends that use RSA will
not work due to lack of RSA in this library.

Needs documentation and help from ports for easy upgrade to full
functionality where legally possible.
