SSLeay 0.6.6 13-Jan-1997

The main additions are

- assember for x86 DES improvments.
  From 191,000 per second on a pentium 100, I now get 281,000.  The inner
  loop and the IP/FP modifications are from
  Svend Olaf Mikkelsen <svolaf@@inet.uni-c.dk>.  Many thanks for his
  contribution.
- The 'DES macros' introduced in 0.6.5 now have 3 types.
  DES_PTR1, DES_PTR2 and 'normal'.  As per before, des_opts reports which
  is best and there is a summery of mine in crypto/des/options.txt
- A few bug fixes.
- Added blowfish.  It is not used by SSL but all the other stuff that
  deals with ciphers can use it in either ecb, cbc, cfb64 or ofb64 modes.
  There are 3 options for optimising Blowfish.  BF_PTR, BF_PTR2 and 'normal'.
  BF_PTR2 is pentium/x86 specific.  The correct option is setup in
  the 'Configure' script.
- There is now a 'get client certificate' callback which can be
  'non-blocking'.  If more details are required, let me know.  It will
  documented more in SSLv3 when I finish it.
- Bug fixes from 0.6.5 including the infamous 'ca' bug.  The 'make test'
  now tests the ca program.
- Lots of little things modified and tweaked.

1.1.1.1
log
@Import of SSLeay-0.9.0b with RSA and IDEA stubbed + OpenBSD build
functionality for shared libs.

Note that routines such as sslv2_init and friends that use RSA will
not work due to lack of RSA in this library.

Needs documentation and help from ports for easy upgrade to full
functionality where legally possible.
