@The OpenSSL project depends on volunteer efforts and financial support from
the end user community. That support comes in the form of donations and paid
sponsorships, software support contracts, paid consulting services
and commissioned software development.

Since all these activities support the continued development and improvement
of OpenSSL we consider all these clients and customers as sponsors of the
OpenSSL project.

We would like to identify and thank the following such sponsors for their past
or current significant support of the OpenSSL project:

Very significant support:

	OpenGear: www.opengear.com

Significant support:

	PSW Group: www.psw.net

Please note that we ask permission to identify sponsors and that some sponsors
we consider eligible for inclusion here have requested to remain anonymous.

Additional sponsorship or financial support is always welcome: for more
information please contact the OpenSSL Software Foundation.
