@RSA Data Security holds software patents on the RSA and RC5 algorithms.
If there ciphers are used used inside the USA (and Japan?), you must contact
RSA Data Security for licencing conditions.

The IDEA algorithm is patented by XXXX and they should be contacted if that
algorithm is to be used.

RC4 is a trademark of RSA Data Security, so use of this label should perhaps
only me used with RSA Data Security's permission.

log
@Import of SSLeay-0.9.0b with RSA and IDEA stubbed + OpenBSD build
functionality for shared libs.

Note that routines such as sslv2_init and friends that use RSA will
not work due to lack of RSA in this library.

Needs documentation and help from ports for easy upgrade to full
functionality where legally possible.
