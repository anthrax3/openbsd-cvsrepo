@SSLeay 0.8.1
	- Mostly bug fixes.  There is an Ephemeral DH cipher problem which
	  is fixed.

SSLeay 0.8.0
	- New release, for those that are wondering what happend to
	  0.7.x, call it our internal development version :-)
	- There have been lots of changes, mostly the addition of SSLv3.
	- There have been many additions from people and amongst
	  others, C2Net has assisted greatly.

SSLeay 0.6.6
	SSLeay 0.8.0 is not upward compatable with SSLeay 0.6.6, so
	if your application requires 0.6.6, use it.  There have been
	lots of bug fixes to 0.8.x that have not been applied to 0.6.6
	so use 0.8.0+ in preference.

PORTING 0.6.6 to 0.8.0
	I'll be documenting this over the next few weeks but as
	pressures have been increasing for making SSLv3 support
	available I'm shipping it without this documentation as I
	basically have not had time to write it (too busy earning a
	living :-)

@Import of SSLeay-0.9.0b with RSA and IDEA stubbed + OpenBSD build
functionality for shared libs.

Note that routines such as sslv2_init and friends that use RSA will
not work due to lack of RSA in this library.

Needs documentation and help from ports for easy upgrade to full
functionality where legally possible.
