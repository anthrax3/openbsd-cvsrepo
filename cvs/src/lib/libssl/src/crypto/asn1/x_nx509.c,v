@Remove initialisers with default values from the ASN1 data structures.

Minor changes in generated assembly due to the compiler swapping from
.quad 0/.long 0 to .zero, along with changes due to line numbering.

@Expand most of the ASN1_SEQUENCE* and associated macros, making the data
structures visible and easier to review, without having to wade through
layers and layers of asn1t.h macros.

Change has been scripted and the generated assembly only differs by changes
to line numbers.
