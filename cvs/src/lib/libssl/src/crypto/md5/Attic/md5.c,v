@Remove various test stubs.  The good ones have been moved by jsing
and others to the regress framework.  These remaining ones just
muddle us up when re-reading code repeatedly.

@Unsurprisingly, since <unistd.h> was so darn hard to find for OpenSSL developers
they had resorted to manually protyping read(2) instead of incredible amount of
preprocessor wizardry needed to find the ever illusive <unistd.h>. Let's just
include <unistd.h> and we don't need to do this.. While we're at it flense
out _OSD_POSIX and __DGJPP__ cruft.

1.1.1.1
log
@Import of SSLeay-0.9.0b with RSA and IDEA stubbed + OpenBSD build
functionality for shared libs.

Note that routines such as sslv2_init and friends that use RSA will
not work due to lack of RSA in this library.

Needs documentation and help from ports for easy upgrade to full
functionality where legally possible.
