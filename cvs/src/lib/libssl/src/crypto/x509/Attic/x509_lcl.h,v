@Stop supporing "legcay" time formats that OpenSSL supports. Rewrite the
utctime and gentime wrappers accordingly. Along with some other cleanup.

@Flense the greasy black guts of unreadble string parsing code out of three areas
in asn1 and x509 code, all dealing with an ASN1_TIME. This brings the parsing
together in one function that converts into a struct tm. While we are at it this
also brings us into conformance with RFC 5280 for times allowed in an X509 cert,
as OpenSSL is very liberal with what it allows.
