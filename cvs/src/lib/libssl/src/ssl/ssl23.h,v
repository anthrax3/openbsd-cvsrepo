@First pass at applying KNF to the OpenSSL code, which almost makes it
readable. This pass is whitespace only and can readily be verified using
tr and md5.

There is still a huge amount of inconsistency within these headers.

1.1.1.1
log
@Import of SSLeay-0.9.0b with RSA and IDEA stubbed + OpenBSD build
functionality for shared libs.

Note that routines such as sslv2_init and friends that use RSA will
not work due to lack of RSA in this library.

Needs documentation and help from ports for easy upgrade to full
functionality where legally possible.
