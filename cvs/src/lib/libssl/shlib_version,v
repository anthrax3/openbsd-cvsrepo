getdirentries() with getdents(), thus immensely simplifying and
accelerating telldir/seekdir.  Build perl with -DBIG_TIME.

Bump the major on every single base library: the compat bits included
here are only good enough to make the transition; the T32 compat
option will be burned as soon as we've reached the new world are

@merge openssl 0.9.6b-engine

Note that this is a maintenence release, API's appear *not* to have changed.
As such, I have only increased the minor number on these libraries

@Crank major number.  openssl on m68k is now compiled in 32 bit mode instead
of 64 bit mode.  This makes ssh -2 run about 10x faster, because the 64 bit
mul instructions no longer need emulation.

@RSA goes in tree for next our next release, as it will be after
Sept 21.  Note: This means you shouldn't really be running -current
for anything in the United States. Either wait for Sept 21, or for the
next release, or move to the free world :)

@OpenSSL 0.9.5 merge

*warning* this bumps shared lib minors for libssl and libcrypto from 2.1 to 2.2
if you are using the ssl26 packages for ssh and other things to work you will
need to get new ones (see ~beck/libsslsnap/<arch>) on cvs or ~beck/src-patent.tar.gz on cvs

1.1.1.1
log
@Import of SSLeay-0.9.0b with RSA and IDEA stubbed + OpenBSD build
functionality for shared libs.

Note that routines such as sslv2_init and friends that use RSA will
not work due to lack of RSA in this library.

Needs documentation and help from ports for easy upgrade to full
functionality where legally possible.
