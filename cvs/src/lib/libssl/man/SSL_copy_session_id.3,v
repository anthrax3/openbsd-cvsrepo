.Dt SSL_COPY_SESSION_ID 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm SSL_copy_session_id
.Nd copy session details between SSL objects
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In openssl/ssl.h
.Ft void
.Fo SSL_copy_session_id
.Fa "SSL *to"
.Fa "const SSL *from"
.Fc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn SSL_copy_session_id
copies the following data from
.Fa from
to
.Fa to :
.Bl -dash
.It
the pointer to the
.Vt SSL_SESSION
object, incrementing its reference count by 1
.It
the pointer to the
.Vt SSL_METHOD
object; if that changes the method, protocol-specific data is
reinitialized
.It
the pointer to the
.Vt CERT
object, incrementing its reference count by 1
.It
the session ID context
.El
.Pp
This function is used internally by
.Xr SSL_dup 3
and by
.Xr BIO_ssl_copy_session_id 3 .
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr BIO_ssl_copy_session_id 3 ,
.Xr SSL_dup 3 ,
.Xr SSL_get_session 3 ,
.Xr SSL_SESSION_get_id 3 ,
.Xr SSL_SESSION_new 3 ,
.Xr SSL_set_session 3 ,
.Xr SSL_set_session_id_context 3
.Sh HISTORY
.Fn SSL_copy_session_id
is available in all versions of OpenSSL.
.Sh BUGS
Failures of
.Xr SSL_set_session 3 ,
.Xr SSL_set_session_id_context 3 ,
.Xr CRYPTO_add 3 ,
and reinitialization of protocol-specific data are silently ignored
and may leave
.Fa to
in an invalid or inconsistent state.
An improved version reporting failure is available in OpenSSL 1.1.0.

1.1
log
@Write SSL_copy_session_id(3) manual from scratch.  This function is
listed in ssl(3) and <openssl/ssl.h>, so it's clearly a public interface.

We might wish to merge the improved code from OpenSSL 1.1.0,
but that's major bump, so i'm documenting the BUGS for now.
