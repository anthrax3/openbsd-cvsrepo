@Add Copyright and license.
Fix the prototype of SSL_get_current_cipher(3).
In the SYNOPSIS, show prototypes rather than #defines.
Some minor improvements from OpenSSL.

.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn SSL_get_current_cipher
returns a pointer to an
.Vt SSL_CIPHER
object containing the description of the actually used cipher of a connection
established with the
.Fa ssl
object.
See
.Xr SSL_CIPHER_get_name 3
for more details.
.Pp
.Fn SSL_get_cipher_name
obtains the name of the currently used cipher.
.Fn SSL_get_cipher
is identical to
.Fn SSL_get_cipher_name .
.Pp
.Fn SSL_get_cipher_bits
obtains the number of secret/algorithm bits used and
.Fn SSL_get_cipher_version
returns the protocol name.
.Pp
.Fn SSL_get_cipher ,
.Fn SSL_get_cipher_name ,
.Fn SSL_get_cipher_bits ,
and
.Fn SSL_get_cipher_version
are implemented as macros.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn SSL_get_current_cipher
returns the cipher actually used, or
.Dv NULL
if no session has been established.
