@New manual pages SSL_get_certificate(3), SSL_get_state(3), and
SSL_num_renegotiations(3) written from scratch.  These functions
are listed in ssl(3) and <openssl/ssl.h>, so they are clearly public.

.Dt SSL_RENEGOTIATE 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm SSL_renegotiate
.Nd request a new session
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In openssl/ssl.h
.Ft int
.Fo SSL_renegotiate
.Fa "SSL *ssl"
.Fc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn SSL_renegotiate
manually instructs
.Fa ssl
to renegotiate and generate a new session.
.Pp
This function is automatically called by
.Xr SSL_read 3
and
.Xr SSL_write 3
whenever the renegotiation byte count set by
.Xr BIO_set_ssl_renegotiate_bytes 3
or the timeout set by
.Xr BIO_set_ssl_renegotiate_timeout 3
are exceeded.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn SSL_renegotiate
always returns 1 unless the protocol-specific flag
.Dv SSL3_FLAGS_NO_RENEGOTIATE_CIPHERS
is set, in which case it may return 0.
The API provides no function to set that flag;
it can only be set by manipulating internal data structures.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr SSL_num_renegotiations 3 ,
.Xr SSL_read 3 ,
.Xr SSL_write 3
.Sh HISTORY
.Fn SSL_renegotiate
is available in all versions of OpenSSL.

1.1
log
@Write SSL_renegotiate(3) manual from scratch; this function is listed
in ssl(3) and <openssl/ssl.h>, so it's clearly a public interface.

More could probably be said, the code looks somewhat mysterious to me,
but i think this stub is already better than nothing.
