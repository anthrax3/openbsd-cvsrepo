@Remove Microsoft Server Gated Crypto.

Another relic due to the old US crypto policy.

From OpenSSL commit 63eab8a620944a990ab3985620966ccd9f48d681 and

.Dt SSL_ACCEPT 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm SSL_accept
.Nd wait for a TLS/SSL client to initiate a TLS/SSL handshake
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In openssl/ssl.h
.Ft int
.Fn SSL_accept "SSL *ssl"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn SSL_accept
waits for a TLS/SSL client to initiate the TLS/SSL handshake.
The communication channel must already have been set and assigned to the
.Fa ssl
object by setting an underlying
.Vt BIO .
.Sh NOTES
The behaviour of
.Fn SSL_accept
depends on the underlying
.Vt BIO .
.Pp
If the underlying
.Vt BIO
is
.Em blocking ,
.Fn SSL_accept
will only return once the handshake has been finished or an error occurred.
.Pp
If the underlying
.Vt BIO
is
.Em non-blocking ,
.Fn SSL_accept
will also return when the underlying
.Vt BIO
could not satisfy the needs of
.Fn SSL_accept
to continue the handshake, indicating the problem by the return value \(mi1.
In this case a call to
.Xr SSL_get_error 3
with the
return value of
.Fn SSL_accept
will yield
.Dv SSL_ERROR_WANT_READ
or
.Dv SSL_ERROR_WANT_WRITE .
The calling process then must repeat the call after taking appropriate action
to satisfy the needs of
.Fn SSL_accept .
The action depends on the underlying
.Dv BIO .
When using a non-blocking socket, nothing is to be done, but
.Xr select 2
can be used to check for the required condition.
When using a buffering
.Vt BIO ,
like a
.Vt BIO
pair, data must be written into or retrieved out of the
.Vt BIO
before being able to continue.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The following return values can occur:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It 0
The TLS/SSL handshake was not successful but was shut down controlled and by
the specifications of the TLS/SSL protocol.
Call
.Xr SSL_get_error 3
with the return value
.Fa ret
to find out the reason.
.It 1
The TLS/SSL handshake was successfully completed,
and a TLS/SSL connection has been established.
.It <0
The TLS/SSL handshake was not successful because a fatal error occurred either
at the protocol level or a connection failure occurred.
The shutdown was not clean.
It can also occur of action is need to continue the operation for non-blocking
.Vt BIO Ns
s.
Call
.Xr SSL_get_error 3
with the return value
.Fa ret
to find out the reason.

will only return once the handshake has been finished or an error occurred,
except for SGC (Server Gated Cryptography).
For SGC,
.Fn SSL_accept
may return with \(mi1, but
.Fn SSL_get_error
will yield
.Dv SSL_ERROR_WANT_READ/WRITE
and
.Fn SSL_accept
should be called again.
