1.3
log
@Update libexpat to version 2.2.1 which has some security fixes.
- CVE-2017-9233 CVE-2016-9063 CVE-2016-5300 CVE-2016-4472 CVE-2016-0718
  CVE-2015-2716 CVE-2015-1283 CVE-2012-6702 CVE-2012-0876 have been
  addressed.  Not all of them affect OpenBSD as we had fixes before.
- Upstream uses arc4random_buf(3) now.  Delete all code for other
  entropy sources to make sure to compile the correct one.  Our
  library already used arc4random(3) before.
- The overflow fixes in rev 1.11 and 1.12 of lib/xmlparse.c
  have been commited upstream in a different way.  Use the upstream
  code to make maintenance easier.
- Although it should be ABI compatible, there is a new global
  symbol align_limit_to_full_utf8_characters.  As it is in
  lib/internal.h, add a Symbols.map to restrict the export.  Do not
  bump the shared library version.
- Use the internal expat's siphash.h.
