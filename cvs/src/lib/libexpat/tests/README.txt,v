1.1
log
@Add test suite source files for expat 2.2.1.
@
text
@This directory contains the (fledgling) test suite for Expat.  The
tests provide general unit testing and regression coverage.  The tests
are not expected to be useful examples of Expat usage; see the
examples/ directory for that.

The Expat tests use a partial internal implementation of the "Check"
unit testing framework for C. More information on Check can be found at:

        http://check.sourceforge.net/

Expat must be built and, depending on platform, must be installed, before "make check" can be executed.

This test suite can all change in a later version.
