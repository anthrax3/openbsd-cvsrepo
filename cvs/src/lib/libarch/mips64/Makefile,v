@for some time now mandoc has not required MLINKS to function
correctly - logically complete that now by removing MLINKS from base;

authors need only to ensure there is an entry in NAME for any function/
util being added. MLINKS will still work, and remain for perl to ease
upgrades;

log
@Provide IRIX-compatible get_fpc_csr() and set_fpc_csr() for mips, although
we don't provide the silly union to decompose the value. This will allow
userland to flip the ``flush denormalized to zero'' setting, which apparently
is being relied upon by tcl.

Asked by jasper@@ a long time ago. Riding upon the upcoming libc major crank.

@Use MACHINE_CPU instead of MACHINE_ARCH to pick the correct machine dependent
files or directories when applicable.
The inspiration and name of MACHINE_CPU come from NetBSD, although the way to
provide it to Makefiles is completely different.

1.1
log
@Add an implementation of IRIX-compatible cacheflush() routine to mips ports,
needed for gcc -ftrampoline operation as well as by some third-party
software.
Although the implementation uses the sysarch() sysctl, the wrapper is
added to libc as it was a direct system call (which it is on IRIX).
