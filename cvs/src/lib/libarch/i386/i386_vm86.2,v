.Sh NAME

.Nd set virtual 8086 processor registers and mode
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/types.h
.In signal.h
.In machine/segments.h
.In machine/sysarch.h
.In machine/vm86.h
.Ft int
.Fn i386_vm86 "struct vm86_struct *vmcp"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn i386_vm86
will set the process into virtual 8086 mode using the registers and
selectors specified by the context pointed to by
.Ar vmcp .
The processor registers are set from
.Ar vmcp->substr.regs ,
and the emulated processor type from
.Ar vmcp->substr.ss_cpu_type .
.Pp
The kernel keeps a pointer to the context, and uses the tables stored at
.Ar vmcp->int_byuser
and
.Ar vmcp->int21_byuser
for fast virtual interrupt handling.
If the
.Ar n Ns Li th
bit is clear in the first of
these arrays, then the kernel may directly emulate the real-mode x86 INT
.Ar n
instruction handling.
If the
.Ar n Ns Li th
bit is set, then the process is
delivered a signal when an INT instruction is executed.
.Pp
Since MS-DOS puts many DOS functions onto interrupt 21, it is handled
specially: the
.Ar k Ns Li th
bit in the
.Ar vmcp->int21_byuser
array is checked when INT
.Ar 21
is requested and the
.Ar ah
register is
.Ar k .
.Pp
.Sy Note:
Code using the
.Fn i386_vm86
function must be compiled using
.Cm -li386 .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
This routine does not normally return: 32-bit mode will be restored by
the delivery of a signal to the process.
In case of an error in setting
the VM86 mode, a value of \-1 is returned and the global variable
.Va errno
is set to indicate the error.
.Sh ERRORS
.Fn i386_vm86
will fail if:
.Bl -tag -width [EINVAL]
.It Bq Er EFAULT
The state at
.Ar vmcp
was not readable to the user process.

log
@First pass at removing clauses 3 and 4 from NetBSD licenses.

Not sure what's more surprising: how long it took for NetBSD to
catch up to the rest of the BSDs (including UCB), or the amount of
code that NetBSD has claimed for itself without attributing to the
actual authors.

- fix remaining .Nm usage as well
- this is from a patch I received from kwesterback@@home.com, who has been

Ok, so there could be a cost/benefit debate with this commit, but since I have
the patch we might as well commit it...
