.Nd get/set orientation of a stream
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In stdio.h
.In wchar.h
.Ft int
.Fn fwide "FILE *stream" "int mode"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn fwide
function
determines the orientation of the stream pointed at by
.Fa stream .
.Pp
If the orientation of
.Fa stream
has already been determined,
.Fn fwide
leaves it unchanged.
Otherwise,
.Fn fwide
sets the orientation of
.Fa stream
according to
.Fa mode .
.Pp
If
.Fa mode
is less than zero,
.Fa stream
is set to byte-oriented.
If it is greater than zero,
.Fa stream
is set to wide-oriented.
Otherwise,
.Fa mode
is zero, and
.Fa stream
is unchanged.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn fwide
returns a value according to orientation after the call of
.Fn fwide ;
a value less than zero if byte-oriented, a value greater than zero
if wide-oriented, and zero if the stream has no orientation.
