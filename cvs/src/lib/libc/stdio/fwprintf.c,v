1.4
log
@Add framework for resolving (pun intended) libc namespace issues, using
wrapper .h files and asm labels to let internal calls resolve directly and
not be overridable or use the PLT.  Then, apply that framework to most of
the functions in stdio.h, string.h, err.h, and wchar.h.  Delete the
should-have-been-hidden-all-along _v?(err|warn)[cx]? symbols while here.

tests clean on i386, amd64, sparc64, powerpc, and mips64

1.1
log
@Add fwprintf, swprintf, vfwprintf, vswprintf, vwprintf, and wprintf to libc.
Based on our vfprintf etc. implementations. Wide character parts based on
NetBSD but with lots of macros expanded. Minor bump for libc.
