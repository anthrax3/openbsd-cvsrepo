@Add framework for resolving (pun intended) libc namespace issues, using
wrapper .h files and asm labels to let internal calls resolve directly and
not be overridable or use the PLT.  Then, apply that framework to most of
the functions in stdio.h, string.h, err.h, and wchar.h.  Delete the
should-have-been-hidden-all-along _v?(err|warn)[cx]? symbols while here.

tests clean on i386, amd64, sparc64, powerpc, and mips64

@Fix the handle locking in stdio to use flockfile/funlockfile
internally when and where required.  Macros in <stdio.h> are updated
to automatically call the underlying functions when the process is
threaded to obtain the necessary locking.  A private mutex is added
to protect __sglue, the internal list of FILE handles, and another
to protect the one-time initialization.  Some routines in libc that
use getc() change to use getc_unlocked() as they're either protected
by their own lock or aren't thread-safe routines anyway.

committing on behalf of and okay guenther@@ now that we have install
media space available.
