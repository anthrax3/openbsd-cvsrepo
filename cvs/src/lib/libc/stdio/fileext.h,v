@Change internals of FILE: reuse the unget buffer field to access an
extended attribute data structure (pimpl idiom). Idea taken from citrus.
Much discussion with deraadt@@, otto@@, millert@@...

This is the least disruptive way to extend FILE, since its size can't really
change without this being a flag day. So the size doesn't change.

Actual additions to the structure will come in separate steps, since this
change is nasty enough on its own.

Tests by otto@@ and others, careful reading of code by otto@@ and millert@@.

This is definitely a major bump, and has been checked to not impact a
full ports build.
