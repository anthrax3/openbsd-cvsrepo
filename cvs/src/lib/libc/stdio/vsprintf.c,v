@Fix the handle locking in stdio to use flockfile/funlockfile
internally when and where required.  Macros in <stdio.h> are updated
to automatically call the underlying functions when the process is
threaded to obtain the necessary locking.  A private mutex is added
to protect __sglue, the internal list of FILE handles, and another
to protect the one-time initialization.  Some routines in libc that
use getc() change to use getc_unlocked() as they're either protected
by their own lock or aren't thread-safe routines anyway.

committing on behalf of and okay guenther@@ now that we have install
media space available.

@Change internals of FILE: reuse the unget buffer field to access an
extended attribute data structure (pimpl idiom). Idea taken from citrus.
Much discussion with deraadt@@, otto@@, millert@@...

This is the least disruptive way to extend FILE, since its size can't really
change without this being a flag day. So the size doesn't change.

Actual additions to the structure will come in separate steps, since this
change is nasty enough on its own.

Tests by otto@@ and others, careful reading of code by otto@@ and millert@@.

This is definitely a major bump, and has been checked to not impact a
full ports build.
