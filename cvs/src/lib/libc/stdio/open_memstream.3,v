.Dt OPEN_MEMSTREAM 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm open_memstream ,
.Nm open_wmemstream
.Nd open a memory buffer stream
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In stdio.h
.Ft FILE *
.Fn open_memstream "char **pbuf" "size_t *psize"
.In wchar.h
.Ft FILE *
.Fn open_wmemstream "wchar_t **pbuf" "size_t *psize"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn open_memstream
and
.Fn open_wmemstream
functions create, respectively, a seekable byte-oriented or wide-oriented
stream for writing.
A dynamically allocated buffer, using
.Xr malloc 3 ,
is then wrapped to the pointer referenced by
.Fa pbuf
and grows automatically as required.
.Pp
When the stream is either closed or flushed, the address of the buffer is
stored in the pointer referenced by
.Fa pbuf .
At the same time the smaller of the current position and the buffer length is
written in the variable pointed to by
.Fa psize .
This value represents, respectively,
the number of bytes or wide characters contained in the buffer,
not including the terminating null character.
.Pp
The buffer memory should be released after the stream is closed.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion,
.Fn open_memstream
and
.Fn open_wmemstream
return a
.Dv FILE
pointer.
Otherwise,
.Dv NULL
is returned and the global variable
.Va errno
is set to indicate the error.
.Sh ERRORS
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The
.Fa pbuf
or the
.Fa psize
argument is
.Dv NULL .
.El
.Pp
The
.Fn open_memstream
and
.Fn open_wmemstream
functions
may also fail and set
.Va errno
for any of the errors
specified for the routine
.Xr malloc 3 .
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr fmemopen 3 ,
.Xr fopen 3 ,
.Xr funopen 3 ,
.Xr malloc 3
.Sh STANDARDS
The functions
.Fn open_memstream
and
.Fn open_wmemstream ,
conform to
.St -p1003.1-2008 .
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Fn open_memstream
and
.Fn open_wmemstream
functions first appeared in
.Ox 5.4 .

1.1
log
@Add an implementation based on tedu@@'s design of fmemopen(3) and
open_memstream(3) so they can be polished in-tree.

One of the manpages comes from NetBSD with some tweaks.
