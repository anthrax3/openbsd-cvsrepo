@Add framework for resolving (pun intended) libc namespace issues, using
wrapper .h files and asm labels to let internal calls resolve directly and
not be overridable or use the PLT.  Then, apply that framework to most of
the functions in stdio.h, string.h, err.h, and wchar.h.  Delete the
should-have-been-hidden-all-along _v?(err|warn)[cx]? symbols while here.

@Fix the handle locking in stdio to use flockfile/funlockfile
internally when and where required.  Macros in <stdio.h> are updated
to automatically call the underlying functions when the process is
threaded to obtain the necessary locking.  A private mutex is added
to protect __sglue, the internal list of FILE handles, and another
to protect the one-time initialization.  Some routines in libc that
use getc() change to use getc_unlocked() as they're either protected
by their own lock or aren't thread-safe routines anyway.

@Change internals of FILE: reuse the unget buffer field to access an
extended attribute data structure (pimpl idiom). Idea taken from citrus.
Much discussion with deraadt@@, otto@@, millert@@...

This is the least disruptive way to extend FILE, since its size can't really
change without this being a flag day. So the size doesn't change.

Actual additions to the structure will come in separate steps, since this
change is nasty enough on its own.

Tests by otto@@ and others, careful reading of code by otto@@ and millert@@.

This is definitely a major bump, and has been checked to not impact a
full ports build.
