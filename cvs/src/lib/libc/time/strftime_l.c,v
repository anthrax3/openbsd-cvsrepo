1.1
log
@New POSIX xlocale implementation written from scratch.
Complete in the sense that all POSIX *locale(3) and *_l(3) functions
are included, but in OpenBSD, we of course only really care about
LC_CTYPE and we only support ASCII and UTF-8.

With important help from kettenis@@, guenther@@, and jca@@.
Repeated testing in ports bulk builds by naddy@@.
Additional testing by jca@@, sebastia@@, dcoppa@@, and others.
OK kettenis@@ dcoppa@@, and guenther@@ on an earlier version.
Riding guenther@@'s libc/librthread major bump.
