@Implement svc_getreq_poll(3) and friends and use poll(2) instead of select(2)
in the libc rpc code.  The main difference between this and the previous
version is the use of a simple free list that simplifies the logic when
adding a socket to svc_pollfd.  I've also added code to pack svc_pollfd
when the free list gets too big.  The idea general idea is to keep
svc_pollfd as tightly packed as possible to make poll(2) efficient.
