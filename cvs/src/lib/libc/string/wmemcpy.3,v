.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm wmemcpy
.Nd copy wide characters
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In wchar.h
.Ft wchar_t *
.Fn wmemcpy "wchar_t * restrict dst" "const wchar_t * restrict src" "size_t len"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn wmemcpy
function copies
.Fa len
wide characters from buffer
.Fa src
to buffer
.Fa dst .
If the two buffers may overlap,
.Xr wmemmove 3
must be used instead.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn wmemcpy
function returns the original value of
.Fa dst .
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr memcpy 3 ,
.Xr wcscpy 3 ,
.Xr wcslcpy 3 ,
.Xr wmemmove 3
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn wmemcpy
function conforms to
.St -isoC-99
and was first introduced in
.St -isoC-amd1 .
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Fn wmemcpy
function was ported from
.Nx
and first appeared in
.Ox 3.8 .

.Sh CAVEATS
In this implementation
.Fn wmemcpy
is implemented using
.Xr bcopy 3 ,
and therefore the buffers may overlap.
On other systems, copying overlapping buffers may produce surprises.
A portable, safe solution is to use
.Xr wmemmove 3 .

A simpler solution is to not use

@Instead of documenting all the wide string functions in wmemchr(3), add
individual pages (based on the existing string man pages). By Tim van
