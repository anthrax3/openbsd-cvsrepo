@New POSIX xlocale implementation written from scratch.
Complete in the sense that all POSIX *locale(3) and *_l(3) functions
are included, but in OpenBSD, we of course only really care about
LC_CTYPE and we only support ASCII and UTF-8.

With important help from kettenis@@, guenther@@, and jca@@.
Repeated testing in ports bulk builds by naddy@@.
Additional testing by jca@@, sebastia@@, dcoppa@@, and others.
OK kettenis@@ dcoppa@@, and guenther@@ on an earlier version.
Riding guenther@@'s libc/librthread major bump.

.Sh DESCRIPTION
These functions compare the wide strings
.Fa s1
and
.Fa s2
and return an integer greater than, equal to, or less than 0,
according to whether
.Fa s1
is lexicographically greater than, equal to, or less than
.Fa s2
after translation of each corresponding wide character to lower case.
The wide strings themselves are not modified.
.Pp
For the translation to lower case,
.Fn wcscasecmp
and
.Fn wcsncasecmp
use the thread-specific locale as defined with
.Xr uselocale 3 ,
falling back to the global locale defined with
.Xr setlocale 3 .
.Fn wcscasecmp_l
and
.Fn wcsncasecmp_l
use the
.Fa locale
argument instead.
.Pp
.Fn wcsncasecmp
and
.Fn wcsncasecmp_l
compare at most
.Fa len
wide characters.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr newlocale 3 ,
.Xr setlocale 3 ,
.Xr strcasecmp 3 ,
.Xr wcscmp 3 ,
.Xr wmemcmp 3
.Sh STANDARDS
These functions conform to
.St -p1003.1-2008 .
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Fn wcscasecmp
and
.Fn wcsncasecmp
functions have been available since
.Ox 5.0 ,
and
.Fn wcscasecmp_l
and
.Fn wcsncasecmp_l
since
.Ox 6.2 .
.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Ox
versions of
.Fn wcscasecmp
and
.Fn wcsncasecmp
were implemented by
.An Marc Espie Aq Mt espie@@openbsd.org .
