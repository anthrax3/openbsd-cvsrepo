.Sh NAME
.Nm wcsdup
.Nd save a copy of a wide string
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In wchar.h
.Ft wchar_t *
.Fn wcsdup "const wchar_t *str"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn wcsdup
function
allocates sufficient memory for a copy
of the wide-character string
.Fa str ,
does the copy, and returns a pointer to it.
The pointer may subsequently be used as an
argument to the function
.Xr free 3 .
.Pp
If insufficient memory is available,
.Dv NULL
is returned.
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following will point
.Va p
to an allocated area of memory containing the nul-terminated string
.Qq foobar :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
const char	*o = "foobar";
wchar_t		*p, b[32];
size_t		 blen;

blen = sizeof(b) / sizeof(b[0]);
if (mbstowcs(b, o, blen) == (size_t)-1)
	err(1, NULL);
b[blen - 1] = 0;
if ((p = wcsdup(b)) == NULL)
	err(1, NULL);
.Ed
.Sh ERRORS
The
.Fn wcsdup
function may fail and set the external variable
.Va errno
for any of the errors specified for the library function
.Xr malloc 3 .
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr free 3 ,
.Xr malloc 3 ,
.Xr strdup 3
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn wcsdup
function conforms to
.St -p1003.1-2008 .
