.Dt WCSCAT 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm wcscat ,
.Nm wcsncat
.Nd concatenate wide strings
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In wchar.h
.Ft wchar_t *
.Fn wcscat "wchar_t * restrict s" "const wchar_t * restrict append"
.Ft wchar_t *
.Fo wcsncat
.Fa "wchar_t * restrict s"
.Fa "const wchar_t * restrict append"
.Fa "size_t count"
.Fc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn wcscat
and
.Fn wcsncat
functions append a copy of the wide string
.Fa append
to the end of the wide string
.Fa s ,
then add a terminating null wide character (L'\e0').
The wide string
.Fa s
must have sufficient space to hold the result.
.Pp
The
.Fn wcsncat
function appends not more than
.Fa count
wide characters where space for the terminating null wide character
should not be included in
.Fa count .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn wcscat
and
.Fn wcsncat
functions return the pointer
.Fa s .
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr strcat 3 ,
.Xr strlcpy 3 ,
.Xr wcscpy 3 ,
.Xr wcslcpy 3 ,
.Xr wmemcpy 3 ,
.Xr wmemmove 3
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn wcscat
and
.Fn wcsncat
functions conform to
.St -isoC-99
and were first introduced in
.St -isoC-amd1 .
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Fn wcscat
and
.Fn wcsncat
functions were ported from
.Nx
and first appeared in
.Ox 3.8 .
.Sh CAVEATS
Using the functions
.Fn wcscat
and
.Fn wcsncat
is very error-prone with respect to buffer overflows;
see the EXAMPLES section in
.Xr strcat 3
for correct usage.
Using
.Xr wcslcat 3
is a better choice in most cases.

@update HISTORY and SEE ALSO for all of string(3), together with various
smaller improvements; jmc@@ and nicm@@ both ask me to get this in because
further tweaking will be easier in-tree

@Instead of documenting all the wide string functions in wmemchr(3), add
individual pages (based on the existing string man pages). By Tim van
der Molen (tbvdm at xs4all dot nl) after a suggestion by millert@@.
