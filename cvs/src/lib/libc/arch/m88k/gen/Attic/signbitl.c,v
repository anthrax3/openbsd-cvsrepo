@Adapt ieee.h, gdtoa and libc to the fact that we don't have 80-bit
floats on m88k.  Agreed by miod@@.

log
@- add long double signbit
- make long double versions weak aliases to double versions,
on archs where long doubles are 64 bits
- no need to have two finites.  finite() and finitef() are
non-standard 3BSD obsolete versions of isfinite.  remove
from libm.  make them weak_alias in libc to __isfinite and
__isfinitef instead.  similarly make 3BSD obsolete versions
of isinf, isinff, isnan, isnanf weak_aliases to C99's
__isinf, __isinff, __isnan, __isnanf
- bump major
