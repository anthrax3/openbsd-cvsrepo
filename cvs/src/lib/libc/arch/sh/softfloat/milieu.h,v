This C header file is part of the SoftFloat IEC/IEEE Floating-point
Arithmetic Package, Release 2a.

Written by John R. Hauser.  This work was made possible in part by the
International Computer Science Institute, located at Suite 600, 1947 Center
Street, Berkeley, California 94704.  Funding was partially provided by the
National Science Foundation under grant MIP-9311980.  The original version
of this code was written as part of a project to build a fixed-point vector
processor in collaboration with the University of California at Berkeley,
overseen by Profs. Nelson Morgan and John Wawrzynek.  More information
is available through the Web page `http://HTTP.CS.Berkeley.EDU/~jhauser/
arithmetic/SoftFloat.html'.

has been made to avoid it, THIS SOFTWARE MAY CONTAIN FAULTS THAT WILL AT
TIMES RESULT IN INCORRECT BEHAVIOR.  USE OF THIS SOFTWARE IS RESTRICTED TO
PERSONS AND ORGANIZATIONS WHO CAN AND WILL TAKE FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY
AND ALL LOSSES, COSTS, OR OTHER PROBLEMS ARISING FROM ITS USE.

Derivative works are acceptable, even for commercial purposes, so long as
(1) they include prominent notice that the work is derivative, and (2) they
include prominent notice akin to these four paragraphs for those parts of
this code that are retained.
