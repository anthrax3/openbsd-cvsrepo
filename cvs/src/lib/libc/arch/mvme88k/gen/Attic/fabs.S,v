@Ok here is the mvme88k userland, minus a few important pieces.
as, ld change need to be merged. It is known that shared libraries and C++
do not work.
If anyone wants to step forward and take over the mvme88k port please do.
It was dumped on me when the original developer, Nivas, left his previous
job and started a new one.

I am trying to get the port in a shape that someone could take over.
