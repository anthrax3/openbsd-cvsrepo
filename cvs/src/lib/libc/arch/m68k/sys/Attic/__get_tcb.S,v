@Retire hp300, mvme68k and mvme88k ports. These ports have no users, keeping

message sent by the three disks which have died on me over the last few days.

Noone sane will mourn these ports anyway. So long, and thanks for the fish.

@Userland bits for m68k/ELF. Mostly addition of register prefixes to the
assembler instructions, and cope with the few changes in return values
location.
