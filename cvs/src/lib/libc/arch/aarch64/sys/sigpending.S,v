1.2
log
@The assembly for sigpending(2) wasn't correctly implemented either.  I
suppose this still stems from the first steps where we tried to get at
least some userland stuff to compile.  This change properly saves the
pointer before doing the syscall and stores the return value in the
pointer on return.  This makes sigpending regress pass.
