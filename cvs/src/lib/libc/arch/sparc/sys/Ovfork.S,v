@Use a Thread Information Block in both single and multi-threaded programs.
This stores errno, the cancelation flags, and related bits for each thread
and is allocated by ld.so or libc.a.  This is an ABI break from 5.9-stable!

Make libpthread dlopen'able by moving the cancelation wrappers into libc
and doing locking and fork/errno handling via callbacks that libpthread
registers when it first initializes.  'errno' *must* be declared via
<errno.h> now!

Clean up libpthread's symbol exports like libc.

On powerpc, offset the TIB/TCB/TLS data from the register per the ELF spec.

@Simplify fork/vfork logic: the kernel has handled returning zero in the child
for a long time, so there's no need to test the second return register here
in the asm stub.
