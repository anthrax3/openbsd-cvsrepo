@Add thread-safety to libc, so that libc_r will build (on i386 at least).
All POSIX libc api now there (to P1003.1c/D10)
  (more md stuff is needed for other libc/arch/*)
  (setlogin is no longer a special syscall)
Add -pthread option to gcc (that makes it use -lc_r and -D_POSIX_THREADS).
Doc some re-entrant routines
Add libc_r to intro(3)
dig() uses some libc srcs and an extra -I was needed there.
Add more md stuff to libc_r.
Update includes for the pthreads api
Update libc_r TODO
