@remove hppa64 port, which we never got going beyond broken single users.
hppa reverse-stack gives us a valuable test case, but most developers don't
have a 2nd one to proceed further with this.

log
@64-bitification went a bit too far here; sigset_t is 32-bit so using 64-bit
loads and stores may trigger an alignment trap.  Also fix issues where the
code was assuming arguments were passed both in registers on the stack.  This
isn't ithe case for hppa64.

@System call stubs don't have a frame of their own, so use EMTRY_LEAF instead
of ENTRY.  This avoids emitting bogus unwind entries, which makes gdb a lot
happier.
