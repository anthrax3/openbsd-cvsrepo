@- move isinf, isnan dups to gen, since most is ieee 754
- is{inf,nan} should be macros for real-floating, so rename to
__is{inf,nan}, per C99
- implement C99 __fpclassify(), __fpclassifyf(), __isfinite(),
__isfinitef(), __isnormal(), __isnormalf(), __signbit(), __signbitf()
- long functions added, but not yet enabled, till ieee.h is fixed
- implement vax equivalents of the functions
- reimplement isinff, isnanf in a better way, and move to libc
- add qnan bytes for all archs
- bump major
man pages will follow
ok millert@@.  arm bits looked over by drahn@@
discussed w/ theo, who showed the right direction, to put these
functions in libc

@mips64 is now going ABI64 and shared library support!
String functions need some optimization/rewrite to take full advantage.
