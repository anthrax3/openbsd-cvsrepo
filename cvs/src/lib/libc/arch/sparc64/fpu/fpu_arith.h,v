 * Extended-precision arithmetic.
 *
 * We hold the notion of a `carry register', which may or may not be a
 * machine carry bit or register.  On the SPARC, it is just the machine's
 * carry bit.
 *
 * In the worst case, you can compute the carry from x+y as
 *	(unsigned)(x + y) < (unsigned)x
 * and from x+y+c as
 *	((unsigned)(x + y + c) <= (unsigned)x && (y|c) != 0)
 * for example.
 */

/* set up for extended-precision arithmetic */
#define	FPU_DECL_CARRY

/*
 * We have three kinds of add:
 *	add with carry:					  r = x + y + c
 *	add (ignoring current carry) and set carry:	c'r = x + y + 0
 *	add with carry and set carry:			c'r = x + y + c
 * The macros use `C' for `use carry' and `S' for `set carry'.
 * Note that the state of the carry is undefined after ADDC and SUBC,
 * so if all you have for these is `add with carry and set carry',
 * that is OK.
 *
 * The same goes for subtract, except that we compute x - y - c.
 *
 * Finally, we have a way to get the carry into a `regular' variable,
 * or set it from a value.  SET_CARRY turns 0 into no-carry, nonzero
 * into carry; GET_CARRY sets its argument to 0 or 1.
