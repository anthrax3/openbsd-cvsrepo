1.4
log
@Merge the sigaction() and sigprocmask() overloads/wrappers from libpthread
into libc, and move pthread_sigmask() as well (just a trivial wrapper).
This provides consistent handling of SIGTHR between single- and multi-threaded
programs and is a step in the merge of all the libpthread overloads, providing
some ASM and Makefile bits that the other wrappers will need.

log
@Adds hidden _libc_FOO aliases for the system call stubs.
Stop generating _brk and _sbrk symbols: they've already been hidden.
Set the ELF symbol size on the syscall stubs.
Give the __{min,cur}brk symbols a size and type, and hide more jump labels.
