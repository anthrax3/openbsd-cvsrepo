log
@Use a Thread Information Block in both single and multi-threaded programs.
This stores errno, the cancelation flags, and related bits for each thread
and is allocated by ld.so or libc.a.  This is an ABI break from 5.9-stable!

Make libpthread dlopen'able by moving the cancelation wrappers into libc
and doing locking and fork/errno handling via callbacks that libpthread
registers when it first initializes.  'errno' *must* be declared via
<errno.h> now!

Clean up libpthread's symbol exports like libc.

On powerpc, offset the TIB/TCB/TLS data from the register per the ELF spec.

@Adds hidden _libc_FOO aliases for the system call stubs.
Stop generating _brk and _sbrk symbols: they've already been hidden.
Set the ELF symbol size on the syscall stubs.
Give the __{min,cur}brk symbols a size and type, and hide more jump labels.

@Convert cpp | as rules in bsd.lib.mk and lib/libc/sys/Makefile.inc to pure cc
invocations.  This allows us to use the compiler builtin define __PIC__ to check
for PIC/PIEness rather than passing -DPIC.  Simplifies PIE work a lot.
