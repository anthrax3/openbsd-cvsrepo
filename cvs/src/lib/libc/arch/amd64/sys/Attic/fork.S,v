@Use a Thread Information Block in both single and multi-threaded programs.
This stores errno, the cancelation flags, and related bits for each thread
and is allocated by ld.so or libc.a.  This is an ABI break from 5.9-stable!

Make libpthread dlopen'able by moving the cancelation wrappers into libc
and doing locking and fork/errno handling via callbacks that libpthread
registers when it first initializes.  'errno' *must* be declared via
<errno.h> now!

Clean up libpthread's symbol exports like libc.

On powerpc, offset the TIB/TCB/TLS data from the register per the ELF spec.

log
@Make pthread_atfork() track the DSO that called it like atexit() does,
unregistering callbacks if the DSO is unloaded.  Move the callback
handling from libpthread to libc, though libpthread still overrides the
inner call to handle locking and thread-library reinitialization.
Major version bump for both libc and libpthread.

@Simplify fork/vfork logic: the kernel has handled returning zero in the child
for a long time, so there's no need to test the second return register here
