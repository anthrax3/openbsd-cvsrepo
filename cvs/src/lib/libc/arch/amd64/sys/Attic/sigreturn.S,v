@Switch sigreturn() to the normal syscall entry instead of int$80.
This was done for the sigreturn call in sigcode before 5.0.

@Define OSYSCALL* macros, as their SYSCALL* counterparts, but using the
int 0x80 mechanism; and use OSYSCALL for sigreturn() as done in the
sigcode.

Naming borrowed from NetBSD.
