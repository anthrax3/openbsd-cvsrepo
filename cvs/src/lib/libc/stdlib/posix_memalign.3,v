.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm posix_memalign
.Nd aligned memory allocation
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In stdlib.h
.Ft int
.Fn posix_memalign "void **ptr" "size_t alignment" "size_t size"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn posix_memalign
function allocates
.Fa size
bytes of memory such that the allocation's base address is a multiple of
.Fa alignment ,
and returns the allocation in the value pointed to by
.Fa ptr .
.Pp
The requested
.Fa alignment
must be a power of 2 at least as large as
.Fn sizeof "void *" .
.Pp
Memory that is allocated via
.Fn posix_memalign
can be used as an argument in subsequent calls to
.Xr realloc 3 ,
.Xr reallocarray 3
and
.Xr free 3 ,
but not
.Xr recallocarray 3
and
.Xr freezero 3 .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn posix_memalign
function returns the value 0 if successful; otherwise it returns an error value.
.Sh ERRORS
The
.Fn posix_memalign
function will fail if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The
.Fa alignment
parameter is not a power of 2 at least as large as
.Fn sizeof "void *" .
.It Bq Er ENOMEM
Memory allocation error.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr free 3 ,
.Xr malloc 3 ,
.Xr realloc 3
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn posix_memalign
function conforms to
.St -p1003.1-2001 .
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Fn posix_memalign
function first appeared in
.Ox 4.8 .

@Support larger-than-page-alignment requests in posix_memalign() by
overallocating and then releasing unneeded memory pages.
