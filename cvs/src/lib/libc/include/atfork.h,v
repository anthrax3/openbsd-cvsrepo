1.1
log
@Make pthread_atfork() track the DSO that called it like atexit() does,
unregistering callbacks if the DSO is unloaded.  Move the callback
handling from libpthread to libc, though libpthread still overrides the
inner call to handle locking and thread-library reinitialization.
Major version bump for both libc and libpthread.
