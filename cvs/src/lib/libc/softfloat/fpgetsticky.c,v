@Pull in namespace.h when building all .c files using gcc's -include option,
so that we can provide asm labels for the memcpy/memset/__stack_smash_handler
calls that it generates ab initio.  Eliminate direct #includes of it.  Make
sure it's a dependency of all objects (unnecessary for asm, but close enough).

@First pass at removing clauses 3 and 4 from NetBSD licenses.

Not sure what's more surprising: how long it took for NetBSD to
catch up to the rest of the BSDs (including UCB), or the amount of
code that NetBSD has claimed for itself without attributing to the
actual authors.
