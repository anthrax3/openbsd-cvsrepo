log
@Pull in namespace.h when building all .c files using gcc's -include option,
so that we can provide asm labels for the memcpy/memset/__stack_smash_handler
calls that it generates ab initio.  Eliminate direct #includes of it.  Make
sure it's a dependency of all objects (unnecessary for asm, but close enough).
