.Sh DESCRIPTION
These routines provide for the creation and manipulation of Universally
Unique Identifiers
.Pq UUIDs ,
also referred to as Globally Unique Identifiers
.Pq GUIDs .
.Pp
The
.Fn uuid_compare
function compares two UUIDs.
It returns \-1 if
.Fa uuid1
precedes
.Fa uuid2 ,
0 if they are equal, or 1 if
.Fa uuid1
follows
.Fa uuid2 .
.Pp
The
.Fn uuid_create
function creates a new UUID.
Storage for the new UUID must be pre-allocated by the caller.
.Pp
The
.Fn uuid_create_nil
function creates a nil-valued UUID.
Storage for the new UUID must be pre-allocated by the caller.
.Pp
The
.Fn uuid_equal
function compares two UUIDs to determine if they are equal.
It returns 1 if they are equal, and 0 if they are not equal.
.Pp
The
.Fn uuid_from_string
function parses a 36-character string representation of a UUID and
converts it to binary representation.
Storage for the UUID must be pre-allocated by the caller.
.Pp
The
.Fn uuid_hash
function generates a hash value for the specified UUID.
Note that the hash value is not a cryptographic hash, and should not be
assumed to be unique given two different UUIDs.
.Pp
The
.Fn uuid_is_nil
function returns 1 if the UUID is nil-valued and 0 if it is not.
.Pp
The
.Fn uuid_to_string
function converts a UUID from binary representation to string representation.
Storage for the string is dynamically allocated and returned via the
.Fa str
argument.
This pointer should be passed to
.Xr free 3
to release the allocated storage when it is no longer needed.
.Pp
The
.Fn uuid_enc_le
and
.Fn uuid_enc_be
functions encode a binary representation of a UUID into an octet stream
in little-endian and big-endian byte order, respectively.
The destination buffer must be pre-allocated by the caller, and must be
large enough to hold the 16-octet binary UUID.
.Pp
The
.Fn uuid_dec_le
and
.Fn uuid_dec_be
functions decode a UUID from an octet stream in little-endian and
big-endian byte order, respectively.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn uuid_compare ,
.Fn uuid_create ,
.Fn uuid_create_nil ,
.Fn uuid_equal ,
.Fn uuid_from_string ,
.Fn uuid_hash ,
.Fn uuid_is_nil ,
and
.Fn uuid_to_string
functions return successful or unsuccessful completion status in the
.Fa status
argument unless it is
.Dv NULL .
Possible values are:
.Bl -tag -width ".Dv uuid_s_invalid_string_uuid"
.It Dv uuid_s_ok
The function completed successfully.
.It Dv uuid_s_bad_version
The UUID does not have a known version.
.It Dv uuid_s_invalid_string_uuid
The string representation of a UUID is not valid.
.It Dv uuid_s_no_memory
Memory could not be allocated for the operation.

.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn uuid_compare ,
.Fn uuid_create ,
.Fn uuid_create_nil ,
.Fn uuid_equal ,
.Fn uuid_from_string ,
.Fn uuid_hash ,
.Fn uuid_is_nil ,
and
.Fn uuid_to_string
functions are compatible with the DCE 1.1 RPC specification.
