.Dt SETREGID 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm setregid
.Nd set real and effective group IDs
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <unistd.h>
.Ft int
.Fn setregid "int rgid" "int egid"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The real and effective group IDs of the current process
are set to the arguments.
Unprivileged users may change the real group
ID to the effective group ID and vice-versa; only the superuser may
make other changes.
.Pp
Supplying a value of \-1 for either the real or effective
group ID forces the system to substitute the current
ID in place of the \-1 parameter.
.Pp
The
.Fn setregid
function was intended to allow swapping the real and
effective group IDs in set-group-ID programs to temporarily relinquish
the set-group-ID value.
This function did not work correctly, and its
purpose is now better served by the use of the
.Fn setegid
function (see
.Xr setuid 2 ) .
.Pp
When setting the real and effective group IDs to the same value, the
standard
.Fn setgid
function is preferred.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion, a value of 0 is returned.
Otherwise, a value of \-1 is returned and
.Va errno
is set to indicate the error.
.Sh ERRORS
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EPERM
The current process is not the superuser and a change
other than changing the effective group ID to the real group ID
was specified.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr getgid 2 ,
.Xr setegid 2 ,
.Xr setgid 2 ,
.Xr setresgid 2 ,
.Xr setuid 2
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn setregid
function is not a part of the
.St -p1003.1
specification and should not be used where portability is desired.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Fn setregid
function call first appeared in
.Bx 4.2 .
A semantically different version appeared in
.Bx 4.4 .
The current version, with the old semantics restored, is implemented via the
.Xr setresgid 2
function which first appeared in
.Ox 3.3 .

- fix remaining .Nm usage as well
- this is from a patch I received from kwesterback@@home.com, who has been
  working on some scripts for fixing formatting errors in mdoc'd man pages

Ok, so there could be a cost/benefit debate with this commit, but since I have
the patch we might as well commit it...
