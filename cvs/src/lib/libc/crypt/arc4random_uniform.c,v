@Wrap <stdlib.h> so that calls go direct and the symbols not in the
C standard are all weak.
Apply __{BEGIN,END}_HIDDEN_DECLS to gdtoa{,imp}.h, hiding the
arch-specific __strtorx, __ULtox_D2A, __strtorQ, __ULtoQ_D2A symbols.

@Split arc4random_uniform into it's own file, to assist other projects
now using this as upstream code.  The particular problem is systems
that contain older arc4random derivations lacking arc4random_uniform().
