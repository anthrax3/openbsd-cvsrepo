.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm wctomb
.Nd converts a wide character to a multibyte character
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In stdlib.h
.Ft int
.Fn wctomb "char * s" "wchar_t wchar"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn wctomb
converts the wide character
.Fa wchar
to the corresponding multibyte character, and stores it in the array
pointed to by
.Fa s .
.Fn wctomb
may store at most
.Dv MB_CUR_MAX
bytes in the array.
.Pp
In state-dependent encoding,
.Fn wctomb
may store the special sequence to change the conversion state
before an actual multibyte character into the array pointed to by
.Fa s .
If
.Fa wchar
is a null wide character
.Pq Sq \e0 ,
this function places its own internal state to an initial conversion state.
.Pp
Calling any other functions in
.Em libc
never change the internal
state of
.Fn wctomb ,
except for calling
.Xr setlocale 3
with the
.Dv LC_CTYPE
category changed to that of the current locale.
Such
.Xr setlocale 3
calls cause the internal state of this function to be indeterminate.
.Pp
The behaviour of
.Fn wctomb
is affected by
.Dv LC_CTYPE
category of the current locale.
.Pp
There is a special case:
.Bl -tag -width 012345678901
.It s == NULL
.Fn wctomb
initializes its own internal state to an initial state, and
determines whether the current encoding is state-dependent.
This function returns 0 if the encoding is state-independent,
otherwise non-zero.
In this case,
.Fa wchar
is completely ignored.
.El
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Normally,
.Fn wctomb
returns:
.Bl -tag -width 012345678901
.It positive
Number of bytes for the valid multibyte character pointed to by
.Fa s .
There are no cases where the value returned is greater than
the value of the
.Dv MB_CUR_MAX
macro.
.It -1
.Fa wchar
is an invalid wide character.
.El
.Pp
If
.Fa s
is equal to
.Dv NULL ,
.Fn wctomb
returns:
.Bl -tag -width 0123456789
.It 0
The current encoding is state-independent.
.It non-zero
The current encoding is state-dependent.
.El
.Sh ERRORS
No errors are defined.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr setlocale 3
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn wctomb
function conforms to
.St -ansiC .

1.1
log
@major abi changes:

* introduce the mbstate_t typedef.
impacts gnu libiconv, which has already been taken care of.

* Prepare for mb stuff to really exist, replace macro MB_CUR_MAX with
an external variable __mb_cur_max (impacts libX11 and various ports).

* use mbstate in all the mb <-> wchar functions with state.
* add a stub iswctype function allowing some ports to compile.

bash and gdiff are missing wcscoll, and need to be told there's no i18n
until this is fixed.

Discussed and matthieu, otto, millert, kettenis, deraadt.

Major libc bump
