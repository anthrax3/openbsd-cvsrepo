.Sh NAME
.Nm wcstombs
.Nd converts a wide-character string to a multibyte character string
.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In stdlib.h
.Ft size_t
.Fn wcstombs "char * restrict s" "const wchar_t * restrict pwcs" "size_t n"
.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn wcstombs
converts the null-terminated wide-character string pointed to by
.Fa pwcs
to the corresponding multibyte character string,
and stores up to
.Fa n
bytes in the array pointed to by
.Fa s .
Each character will be converted as if
.Xr wctomb 3
is continuously called, except the internal state of
.Xr wctomb 3
will not be affected.
.Pp
For state-dependent encoding, the
.Fn wcstombs
implies the result multibyte character string pointed to by
.Fa s
always to begin with an initial state.
.Pp
The behaviour of the
.Fn wcstombs
is affected by the
.Dv LC_CTYPE
category of the current locale.
.Pp
There are special cases:
.Bl -tag -width 012345678901
.It s == NULL
The
.Fn wcstombs
returns the number of bytes to store the whole multibyte character string
corresponding to the wide-character string pointed to by
.Fa pwcs .
In this case,
.Fa n
is ignored.
.It pwcs == NULL
Undefined (may causes the program to crash).
.El
.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn wcstombs
returns:
.Bl -tag -width 012345678901
.It 0 or positive
Number of bytes stored in the array pointed to by
.Fa s .
There are no cases that the value returned is greater than
.Fa n
(unless
.Fa s
is a null pointer).
If the return value is equal to
.Fa n ,
the string pointed to by
.Fa s
will not be null-terminated.
.It (size_t)-1
.Fa pwcs
points the string containing invalid wide character.
.Fn wcstombs
also sets
.Va errno
to indicate the error.
.El
.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------
.Sh ERRORS
.Fn wcstombs
may cause an error in the following cases:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EILSEQ
.Fa pwcs
Points to the string containing invalid wide character.
.El
.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr setlocale 3 ,
.Xr wctomb 3
.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn wcstombs
function conforms to
.St -ansiC .
The restrict qualifier is added at
.\" .St -isoC99 .
ISO/IEC 9899/1999
.Pq Dq ISO C99 .

@observe the following spelling:

- wide-character (adjective)

this is the "fix of least resistance", and appears to be in line with
posix style; a tiny fix still needed for curses, but i'll mail that
upstream;

1.1
log
@major abi changes:

* introduce the mbstate_t typedef.
impacts gnu libiconv, which has already been taken care of.

* Prepare for mb stuff to really exist, replace macro MB_CUR_MAX with
an external variable __mb_cur_max (impacts libX11 and various ports).

* use mbstate in all the mb <-> wchar functions with state.
* add a stub iswctype function allowing some ports to compile.

bash and gdiff are missing wcscoll, and need to be told there's no i18n
until this is fixed.

Discussed and matthieu, otto, millert, kettenis, deraadt.

Major libc bump
