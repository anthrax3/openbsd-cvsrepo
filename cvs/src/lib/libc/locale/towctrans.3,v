@New POSIX xlocale implementation written from scratch.
Complete in the sense that all POSIX *locale(3) and *_l(3) functions
are included, but in OpenBSD, we of course only really care about
LC_CTYPE and we only support ASCII and UTF-8.

With important help from kettenis@@, guenther@@, and jca@@.
Repeated testing in ports bulk builds by naddy@@.
Additional testing by jca@@, sebastia@@, dcoppa@@, and others.
OK kettenis@@ dcoppa@@, and guenther@@ on an earlier version.
Riding guenther@@'s libc/librthread major bump.

.Sh NAME
.Nm towctrans ,
.Nm towctrans_l
.Nd convert a wide character with a specified map
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In wctype.h
.Ft wint_t
.Fn towctrans "wint_t wc" "wctrans_t charmap"
.Ft wint_t
.Fn towctrans_l "wint_t wc" "wctrans_t charmap" "locale_t locale"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
These functions convert the wide character
.Fa wc
with a character mapping
.Fa charmap .
.Pp
The behaviour is undefined if
.Fa charmap
or
.Fa wc
is invalid.
When
.Fa charmap
is retrieved with
.Xr wctrans 3 ,
it becomes invalid when the thread-specific character encoding locale
is changed with
.Xr uselocale 3
or when the global character encoding locale is changed with
.Xr setlocale 3 .
When
.Fa charmap
is retrieved with
.Xr wctrans_l 3 ,
it is only valid for use with the same
.Fa locale
argument.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
These functions return the resulting wide character, or
.Fa wc
if there is no corresponding character in
.Fa charmap .
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr iswctype 3 ,
.Xr newlocale 3 ,
.Xr setlocale 3 ,
.Xr towlower 3 ,
.Xr wctrans 3
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn towctrans
function conforms to
.St -isoC-amd1 ,
and
.Fn towctrans_l
to
.St -p1003.1-2008 .
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Fn towctrans
function has been available since
.Ox 3.8 ,
and
.Fn towctrans_l
since
.Ox 6.2 .
