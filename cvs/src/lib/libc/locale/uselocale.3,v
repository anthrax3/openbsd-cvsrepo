log
@New POSIX xlocale implementation written from scratch.
Complete in the sense that all POSIX *locale(3) and *_l(3) functions
are included, but in OpenBSD, we of course only really care about
LC_CTYPE and we only support ASCII and UTF-8.

With important help from kettenis@@, guenther@@, and jca@@.
Repeated testing in ports bulk builds by naddy@@.
Additional testing by jca@@, sebastia@@, dcoppa@@, and others.
OK kettenis@@ dcoppa@@, and guenther@@ on an earlier version.
Riding guenther@@'s libc/librthread major bump.

.Sh NAME
.Nm uselocale
.Nd select the locale for the current thread
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In locale.h
.Ft locale_t
.Fo uselocale
.Fa "locale_t newloc"
.Fc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The function
.Fn uselocale
selects
.Fa newloc
for use by functions in the current thread that do not take a
.Vt locale_t
argument.
Neither the global locale set by
.Xr setlocale 3
nor locales used by other threads change.
.Pp
The current thread uses
.Fa newloc
until
.Fn uselocale
is called again successfully with a non-null argument
in the same thread, and passing
.Fa newloc
to
.Xr freelocale 3
or
.Xr newlocale 3
before that results in undefined behaviour.
.Pp
To revoke the use of
.Fa newloc
in the current thread without installing another thread-specific locale,
instead reverting to the global locale, call
.Fn uselocale
with the special argument
.Dv LC_GLOBAL_LOCALE .
.Pp
When called with the argument
.Po Vt locale_t Pc Ns 0 ,
the thread-specific locale remains unchanged.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The function
.Fn uselocale
returns the thread-specific locale which is in use right before the call,
or the special return value
.Dv LC_GLOBAL_LOCALE
if the thread used the global locale before the call.
.Sh ERRORS
The function
.Fn uselocale
fails if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The
.Fa newloc
argument is neither a valid locale object nor
.Po Vt locale_t Pc Ns 0 .

.Xr newlocale 3 ,
.Xr towctrans 3 ,

.Xr wcscasecmp 3 ,

.Xr wctype 3
.Sh STANDARDS
The function
.Fn uselocale
conforms to
.St -p1003.1-2008 .
.Sh HISTORY
The function
.Fn uselocale
has been available since
.Ox 6.2 .
