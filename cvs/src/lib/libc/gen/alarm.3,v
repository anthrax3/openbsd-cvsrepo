.Dt ALARM 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm alarm
.Nd set signal timer alarm
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In unistd.h
.Ft unsigned int
.Fn alarm "unsigned int seconds"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Bf -symbolic
This is a simplified interface to
.Xr setitimer 2 .
.Ef
.Pp
The
.Fn alarm
function waits a count of
.Ar seconds
before asserting the terminating signal
.Dv SIGALRM .
When the signal has successfully been caught,
.Fn alarm
returns the amount of time left on the clock.
The maximum number of
.Ar seconds
allowed
is 100000000.
.Pp
If an alarm has been set with
.Fn alarm ,
another call to
.Fn alarm
will supersede the prior call.
The request
.Fn alarm "0"
voids the current
alarm.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
If the call succeeds, any time left remaining from a previous call is returned.
If an error occurs, the value \-1 is returned, and a more precise
error code is placed in the global variable
.Va errno .
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr setitimer 2 ,
.Xr sigaction 2 ,
.Xr sigsuspend 2 ,
.Xr signal 3 ,
.Xr sleep 3 ,
.Xr ualarm 3
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn alarm
function conforms to
.St -p1003.1-2008 .
.Sh HISTORY
An
.Fn alarm
system call appeared in the Programmer's Workbench (PWB/UNIX)
and was ported to
.At v7 .
For
.Bx 4.1c ,
it was reimplemented as a wrapper around the
.Xr setitimer 2
system call.

1.14
log
@The CSRG declared alarm(3) obsolete 30 years ago (before 4.2BSD),
but it is likely to remain in POSIX for the forseeable future,
and there is nothing wrong with using it, so remove the marker.
By contrast, POSIX 2008 now declared setitimer(3) obsolescent.

While here, remove a few cross references pointing to obsolete or
non-standard functions and update the POSIX reference.

Triggered by a question from <ChrisBennett at bennettconstruction dot us>.

@- remove all trailing whitespace

- fix remaining .Nm usage as well
- this is from a patch I received from kwesterback@@home.com, who has been
  working on some scripts for fixing formatting errors in mdoc'd man pages

Ok, so there could be a cost/benefit debate with this commit, but since I have
the patch we might as well commit it...
