.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm user_from_uid ,
.Nm group_from_gid
.Nd cache password and group entries
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In grp.h
.In pwd.h
.Ft char *
.Fn user_from_uid "uid_t uid" "int nouser"
.Ft char *
.Fn group_from_gid "gid_t gid" "int nogroup"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn user_from_uid
function returns the user name associated with the argument
.Fa uid .
The user name is cached so that multiple calls with the same
.Fa uid
do not require additional calls to
.Xr getpwuid 3 .
If there is no user associated with the
.Fa uid ,
a pointer is returned
to a string representation of the
.Fa uid ,
unless the argument
.Fa nouser
is non-zero, in which case a null pointer is returned.
.Pp
The
.Fn group_from_gid
function returns the group name associated with the argument
.Fa gid .
The group name is cached so that multiple calls with the same
.Fa gid
do not require additional calls to
.Xr getgrgid 3 .
If there is no group associated with the
.Fa gid ,
a pointer is returned
to a string representation of the
.Fa gid ,
unless the argument
.Fa nogroup
is non-zero, in which case a null pointer is returned.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr getgrgid 3 ,
.Xr getpwuid 3
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Fn user_from_uid
and
.Fn group_from_gid
functions first appeared in
.Bx 4.4 .

@- remove all trailing whitespace
     * except when it is escaped with a `\' at the end of the line
- fix remaining .Nm usage as well
- this is from a patch I received from kwesterback@@home.com, who has been
  working on some scripts for fixing formatting errors in mdoc'd man pages

Ok, so there could be a cost/benefit debate with this commit, but since I have
the patch we might as well commit it...

1.6
log
@After some constructive criticism from pjanzen@@ and some e-mail tag:

   - only use the .Dv NULL form when referring explicitly to a function
     argument or return value
   - otherwise, use these forms:
        o non-null
        o null-terminated (hyphenated form for predicate adjective)
        o else, null terminated, or null terminate, whichever the case
        o null pointer, null byte, null string, etc.
   - may use NUL to refer to an ASCII NUL, but it doesn't need a .Tn macro

In general, capitalizing the word "null" everywhere is unnecessary and makes
the man pages harder to read. The above is consistent with popular programming
texts (i.e., K&R, Stevens).
