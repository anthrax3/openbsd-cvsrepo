@New POSIX xlocale implementation written from scratch.
Complete in the sense that all POSIX *locale(3) and *_l(3) functions
are included, but in OpenBSD, we of course only really care about
LC_CTYPE and we only support ASCII and UTF-8.

With important help from kettenis@@, guenther@@, and jca@@.
Repeated testing in ports bulk builds by naddy@@.
Additional testing by jca@@, sebastia@@, dcoppa@@, and others.
OK kettenis@@ dcoppa@@, and guenther@@ on an earlier version.
Riding guenther@@'s libc/librthread major bump.

.Dt ISALNUM 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm isalnum ,
.Nm isalnum_l
.Nd alphanumeric single-byte character test
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In ctype.h
.Ft int
.Fn isalnum "int c"
.Ft int
.Fn isalnum_l "int c" "locale_t locale"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn isalnum
function tests for any character for which
.Xr isalpha 3
or
.Xr isdigit 3
is true, and
.Fn isalnum_l
tests for any character for which
.Xr isalpha_l 3
or
.Xr isdigit_l 3
is true.
.Pp
In the C locale, the complete list of alphanumeric characters
is A\(enZ, a\(enz, 0, and 1\(en9.
.Ox
always uses the C locale for these functions,
ignoring the global locale, the thread-specific locale, and the
.Fa locale
argument.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
These functions return zero if the character tests false or
non-zero if the character tests true.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
On systems supporting non-ASCII single-byte character encodings,
these functions may return non-zero for additional characters,
and the results of
.Fn isalnum
may depend on the
.Ev LC_CTYPE
.Xr locale 1 .
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr isalpha 3 ,
.Xr isascii 3 ,
.Xr isblank 3 ,
.Xr iscntrl 3 ,
.Xr isdigit 3 ,
.Xr isgraph 3 ,
.Xr islower 3 ,
.Xr isprint 3 ,
.Xr ispunct 3 ,
.Xr isspace 3 ,
.Xr isupper 3 ,
.Xr iswalnum 3 ,
.Xr isxdigit 3 ,
.Xr stdio 3 ,
.Xr toascii 3 ,
.Xr tolower 3 ,
.Xr toupper 3 ,
.Xr ascii 7
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn isalnum
function conforms to
.St -ansiC ,
and
.Fn isalnum_l
to
.St -p1003.1-2008 .
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Fn isalnum
function first appeared in
.At v7 ,
and
.Fn isalnum_l
has been available since
.Ox 6.2 .
.Sh CAVEATS
The argument
.Fa c
must be
.Dv EOF
or representable as an
.Li unsigned char ;
otherwise, the result is undefined.

@- remove all trailing whitespace
     * except when it is escaped with a `\' at the end of the line
- fix remaining .Nm usage as well
- this is from a patch I received from kwesterback@@home.com, who has been
  working on some scripts for fixing formatting errors in mdoc'd man pages

Ok, so there could be a cost/benefit debate with this commit, but since I have
the patch we might as well commit it...
