.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm posix_spawn_file_actions_init ,
.Nm posix_spawn_file_actions_destroy
.Nd create and destroy posix_spawn file actions objects
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In spawn.h
.Ft int
.Fn posix_spawn_file_actions_init "posix_spawn_file_actions_t *file_actions"
.Ft int
.Fn posix_spawn_file_actions_destroy "posix_spawn_file_actions_t *file_actions"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
File actions objects can be initialized by
.Fn posix_spawn_file_actions_init
and destroyed by
.Fn posix_spawn_file_actions_destroy .
.Pp
Multiple initialization of the same object is undefined behavior
and will lead to memory leaks.
.Pp
Similarly, objects should be passed to
.Fn posix_spawn_file_actions_destroy
to reclaim memory.
The object should not be re-used after destruction.
It can however be initialized again with
.Fn posix_spawn_file_actions_init .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
These function return 0 on successful completion.
They may return
.Er ENOMEM
when running out of memory.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr posix_spawn 3 ,
.Xr posix_spawn_file_actions_addopen 3
.Sh STANDARDS
Both functions conform to
.St -p1003.1-2001 .
