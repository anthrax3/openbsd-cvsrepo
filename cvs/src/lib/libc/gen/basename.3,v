.Sh NAME
.Nm basename
.Nd extract the base portion of a pathname
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In libgen.h
.Ft char *
.Fn basename "const char *path"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn basename
function returns the last component from the pathname pointed to by
.Ar path ,
deleting any trailing
.Sq \&/
characters.
If
.Ar path
consists entirely of
.Sq \&/
characters, a pointer to the string
.Qq \&/
is returned.
If
.Ar path
is a null pointer or the empty string, a pointer to the string
.Qq \&.
is returned.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
On successful completion,
.Fn basename
returns a pointer to the last component of
.Ar path .
.Pp
If
.Fn basename
fails, a null pointer is returned and the global variable
.Va errno
is set to indicate the error.
.Sh ERRORS
The following error codes may be set in
.Va errno :
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er ENAMETOOLONG
The path component to be returned was larger than
.Dv PATH_MAX .
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr basename 1 ,
.Xr dirname 1 ,
.Xr dirname 3
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn basename
function conforms to
.St -xpg4.2 .
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Fn basename
function first appeared in
.Ox 2.2 .
.Sh AUTHORS
.An Todd C. Miller
.Sh CAVEATS
.Fn basename
returns a pointer to internal static storage space that will be overwritten
by subsequent calls.
.Pp
Other vendor implementations of
.Fn basename
may modify the contents of the string passed to
.Fn basename ;
this should be taken into account when writing code which calls this function
if portability is desired.

@After some constructive criticism from pjanzen@@ and some e-mail tag:

   - only use the .Dv NULL form when referring explicitly to a function
     argument or return value
   - otherwise, use these forms:
        o non-null
        o null-terminated (hyphenated form for predicate adjective)
        o else, null terminated, or null terminate, whichever the case
        o null pointer, null byte, null string, etc.
   - may use NUL to refer to an ASCII NUL, but it doesn't need a .Tn macro

In general, capitalizing the word "null" everywhere is unnecessary and makes
the man pages harder to read. The above is consistent with popular programming
texts (i.e., K&R, Stevens).

The
.Fn dirname
function
is the converse of
.Fn basename ;
it returns a pointer to the parent directory of the pathname pointed to by
.Ar path .
Any trailing '/' characters are not counted as part of the directory
name.  If
.Ar path
is a NULL pointer, the empty string, or contains no '/' characters,
.Fn dirname
returns a pointer to the string ".", signifying the current directory.
