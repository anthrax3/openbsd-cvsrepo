.Dt VALLOC 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm valloc
.Nd aligned memory allocation function
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In unistd.h
.Ft void *
.Fn valloc "size_t size"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Bf -symbolic
The
.Fn valloc
function is obsoleted by the current version of
.Xr malloc 3 ,
which aligns page-sized and larger allocations,
and
.Xr posix_memalign 3 ,
which allocates memory with a given alignment.
.Ef
.Pp
The
.Fn valloc
function allocates
.Fa size
bytes aligned on a page boundary.
It is implemented by calling
.Xr malloc 3
with a slightly larger request, saving the true beginning of the block
allocated, and returning a properly aligned pointer.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn valloc
function returns
a pointer to the allocated space if successful; otherwise a
null pointer is returned.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr malloc 3
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Fn valloc
function appeared in
.Bx 3.0 .
.Sh BUGS
A
.Fn vfree
function has not been implemented.

@- remove all trailing whitespace
     * except when it is escaped with a `\' at the end of the line
- fix remaining .Nm usage as well
- this is from a patch I received from kwesterback@@home.com, who has been
  working on some scripts for fixing formatting errors in mdoc'd man pages

Ok, so there could be a cost/benefit debate with this commit, but since I have
the patch we might as well commit it...

1.7
log
@After some constructive criticism from pjanzen@@ and some e-mail tag:

   - only use the .Dv NULL form when referring explicitly to a function
     argument or return value
   - otherwise, use these forms:
        o non-null
        o null-terminated (hyphenated form for predicate adjective)
        o else, null terminated, or null terminate, whichever the case
        o null pointer, null byte, null string, etc.
   - may use NUL to refer to an ASCII NUL, but it doesn't need a .Tn macro

In general, capitalizing the word "null" everywhere is unnecessary and makes
the man pages harder to read. The above is consistent with popular programming
texts (i.e., K&R, Stevens).
