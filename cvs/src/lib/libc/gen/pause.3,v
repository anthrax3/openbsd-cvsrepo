.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm pause
.Nd stop until signal
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In unistd.h
.Ft int
.Fn pause void
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Bf -symbolic
Pause is made obsolete by
.Xr sigsuspend 2 .
.Ef
.Pp
The
.Fn pause
function forces a process to pause until a signal is received from either the
.Xr kill 2
function or an interval timer
(see
.Xr setitimer 2 ) .
.Pp
Upon termination of a signal handler started during a
.Fn pause ,
the
.Fn pause
call will return.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Always returns \-1.
.Sh ERRORS
The
.Fn pause
function may set the global variable
.Va errno
to the following error:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EINTR
The call was interrupted.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr kill 2 ,
.Xr select 2 ,
.Xr setitimer 2 ,
.Xr sigsuspend 2
.Sh HISTORY
A
.Fn pause
system call first appeared in the Programmer's Workbench (PWB/UNIX)
and was then ported to
.At v7 .
It was reimplemented as a wrapper around the
.Fn sigpause
and
.Fn sigblock
system calls in
.Bx 4.2 ,
and around the
.Xr sigsuspend 2
and
.Xr sigprocmask 2
system calls in
.Bx 4.3 Reno .

@- remove all trailing whitespace
     * except when it is escaped with a `\' at the end of the line
- fix remaining .Nm usage as well
- this is from a patch I received from kwesterback@@home.com, who has been
  working on some scripts for fixing formatting errors in mdoc'd man pages

Ok, so there could be a cost/benefit debate with this commit, but since I have
the patch we might as well commit it...
