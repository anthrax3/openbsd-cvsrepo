@Reduce usage of predefined strings in manpages.

Predefined strings are not very portable across troff implementations,
and they make the source much harder to read. Usually the intended
character can be written directly.

No output changes, except for two instances where the incorrect escape
was used in the first place.

.Sh NAME
.Nm scandir ,
.Nm alphasort
.Nd scan a directory
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/types.h
.In dirent.h
.Ft int
.Fo scandir
.Fa "const char *dirname"
.Fa "struct dirent ***namelist"
.Fa "int (*select)(const struct dirent *)"
.Fa "int (*compar)(const struct dirent **, const struct dirent **)"
.Fc
.Ft int
.Fn alphasort "const struct dirent **d1" "const struct dirent **d2"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn scandir
function reads the directory
.Fa dirname
and builds an array of pointers to directory
entries using
.Xr malloc 3 .
It returns the number of entries in the array.
A pointer to the array of directory entries is stored in the location
referenced by
.Fa namelist .
.Pp
The
.Fa select
parameter is a pointer to a user-supplied subroutine which is called by
.Fn scandir
to select which entries are to be included in the array.
The select routine is passed a
pointer to a directory entry and should return a non-zero
value if the directory entry is to be included in the array.
If
.Fa select
is
.Dv NULL ,
then all directory entries will be included.
.Pp
The
.Fa compar
parameter is a pointer to a user-supplied subroutine which is passed to
.Xr qsort 3
to sort the completed array.
If this pointer is
.Dv NULL ,
the array is not sorted.
.Pp
The
.Fn alphasort
function is a routine which can be used for the
.Fa compar
parameter to sort the array alphabetically.
.Pp
The memory allocated for the array can be deallocated with
.Xr free 3 ,
by freeing each pointer in the array and then the array itself.
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
Returns \-1 if the directory cannot be opened for reading or if
.Xr malloc 3
cannot allocate enough memory to hold all the data structures.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr directory 3 ,
.Xr malloc 3 ,
.Xr qsort 3 ,
.Xr dir 5
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn scandir
and
.Fn alphasort
functions conform to
.St -p1003.1-2008 .
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Fn scandir
and
.Fn alphasort
functions appeared in
.Bx 4.2 .
.Pp
The argument types for
.Fn alphasort
and for the
.Fn compar
argument to
.Fn scandir
were originally
.Vt "void *" ,
then changed to
.Vt "const void *" ,
and then finally changed by
.St -p1003.1-2008
to their current form of
.Vt "const struct dirent **" .
Similarly, the
.Fn select
argument to
.Fn scandir
was originally
.Vt "struct dirent *"
until it was changed to its current form of
.Vt "const struct dirent *" .

- fix remaining .Nm usage as well
- this is from a patch I received from kwesterback@@home.com, who has been

Ok, so there could be a cost/benefit debate with this commit, but since I have
the patch we might as well commit it...
