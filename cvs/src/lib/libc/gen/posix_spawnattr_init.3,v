.Sh NAME
.Nm posix_spawnattr_init ,
.Nm posix_spawnattr_destroy
.Nd create and destroy posix_spawn attributes object
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In spawn.h
.Ft int
.Fn posix_spawnattr_init "posix_spawnattr_t *attr"
.Ft int
.Fn posix_spawnattr_destroy "posix_spawnattr_t *attr"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Xr posix_spawn 3
attributes objects can be initialized by
.Fn posix_spawnattr_init
and destroyed by
.Fn posix_spawnattr_destroy .
.Pp
Initialization fills an attributes object pointed by
.Fa attr
with the default values for all the attributes.
.Pp
Multiple initialization of the same object is undefined behavior
and will lead to memory leaks.
.Pp
Similarly, objects should be passed to
.Fn posix_spawnattr_destroy
to reclaim memory.
The object should not be re-used after destruction.
It can however be initialized again with
.Fn posix_spawnattr_init .
.Pp
An attributes object, possibly modified by
.Fn posix_spawn_set* ,
is used to specify what process attributes
will be passed across a spawn operation as implemented by
.Fn posix_spawn
or
.Fn posix_spawnp .
.Pp
Attribute details are described in
.Xr posix_spawnattr_setflags 3 .
.Pp
Modifying or destroying attributes object
will not affect processes that have already been spawned.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
These function return 0 on successful completion.
They may return
.Er ENOMEM
when running out of memory.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr posix_spawn 3
.Sh STANDARDS
Both functions conform to
.St -p1003.1-2001 .

a31 1
The
d33 4
a36 1
function initializes a spawn attributes object
d38 4
a41 4
with the default value for all of the individual attributes used by the
implementation.
Initializing an already initialized spawn attributes object may cause
memory to be leaked.

a43 1
The
d45 3
a47 4
function destroys a spawn attributes object.
A destroyed
.Fa attr
attributes object can be reinitialized using
a48 1
The object should not be used after it has been destroyed.
d50 4
a53 9
A spawn attributes object is of type
.Vt posix_spawnattr_t
(defined in
.In spawn.h )
and is used to specify the inheritance of process attributes across a
spawn operation.
.Pp
The resulting spawn attributes object (possibly modified by setting
individual attribute values), is used to modify the behavior of
d57 3
a59 7
After a spawn attributes object has been used to spawn a process by a
call to a
.Fn posix_spawn
or
.Fn posix_spawnp ,
any function affecting the attributes object (including destruction)
will not affect any process that has been spawned in this way.

Upon successful completion,
.Fn posix_spawnattr_init
and
.Fn posix_spawnattr_destroy
return zero;
otherwise, an error number is returned to indicate the error.
