.Dt GETCWD 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm getcwd ,
.Nm getwd
.Nd get working directory pathname
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In unistd.h
.Ft char *
.Fn getcwd "char *buf" "size_t size"
.Ft char *
.Fn getwd "char *buf"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn getcwd
function copies the absolute pathname of the current working directory
into the memory referenced by
.Fa buf
and returns a pointer to
.Fa buf .
The
.Fa size
argument is the size, in bytes, of the array referenced by
.Fa buf .
.Pp
If
.Fa buf
is
.Dv NULL ,
space is allocated as necessary to store the pathname.
This space may later be
.Xr free 3 Ns 'd.
.Pp
The function
.Fn getwd
is a compatibility routine which calls
.Fn getcwd
with its
.Fa buf
argument and a size of
.Dv PATH_MAX
(as defined in the include
file
.In limits.h ) .
Obviously,
.Fa buf
should be at least
.Dv PATH_MAX
bytes in length.
.Pp
These routines have traditionally been used by programs to save the
name of a working directory for the purpose of returning to it.
A much faster and less error-prone method of accomplishing this is to
open the current directory
.Pq Pa \&.
and use the
.Xr fchdir 2
function to return.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion, a pointer to the pathname is returned.
Otherwise a null pointer is returned and the global variable
.Va errno
is set to indicate the error.
In addition,
.Fn getwd
copies the error message associated with
.Va errno
into the memory referenced by
.Fa buf .
.Sh ERRORS
The
.Fn getwd
function will fail if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EACCES
Read or search permission was denied for a component of the pathname.
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The
.Fa size
argument is zero.
.It Bq Er ENOENT
A component of the pathname no longer exists.
.It Bq Er ENOMEM
Insufficient memory is available.
.It Bq Er ERANGE
The
.Fa size
argument is greater than zero but smaller than the length of the pathname
plus 1.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr pwd 1 ,
.Xr chdir 2 ,
.Xr fchdir 2 ,
.Xr malloc 3 ,
.Xr strerror 3
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn getcwd
function conforms to
.St -p1003.1-2001 .
The ability to specify a null pointer and have
.Fn getcwd
allocate memory as necessary is an extension.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Fn getwd
function first appeared in
.Bx 4.0 ,
and
.Fn getcwd
in
.Bx 4.3 Net2 .
.Sh BUGS
The
.Fn getwd
function does not do sufficient error checking and is not able to return very
long, but valid, paths.
It is provided for compatibility.

@- remove all trailing whitespace
     * except when it is escaped with a `\' at the end of the line
- fix remaining .Nm usage as well
- this is from a patch I received from kwesterback@@home.com, who has been
  working on some scripts for fixing formatting errors in mdoc'd man pages

Ok, so there could be a cost/benefit debate with this commit, but since I have
the patch we might as well commit it...

log
@After some constructive criticism from pjanzen@@ and some e-mail tag:

   - only use the .Dv NULL form when referring explicitly to a function
     argument or return value
   - otherwise, use these forms:
        o non-null
        o null-terminated (hyphenated form for predicate adjective)
        o else, null terminated, or null terminate, whichever the case
        o null pointer, null byte, null string, etc.
   - may use NUL to refer to an ASCII NUL, but it doesn't need a .Tn macro

In general, capitalizing the word "null" everywhere is unnecessary and makes
the man pages harder to read. The above is consistent with popular programming
texts (i.e., K&R, Stevens).
