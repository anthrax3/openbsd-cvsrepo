.Sh NAME
.Nm isgreater ,
.Nm isgreaterequal ,
.Nm isless ,
.Nm islessequal ,
.Nm islessgreater ,
.Nm isunordered
.Nd compare two floating-point numbers
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In math.h
.Ft int
.Fn isgreater "real-floating x" "real-floating y"
.Ft int
.Fn isgreaterequal "real-floating x" "real-floating y"
.Ft int
.Fn isless "real-floating x" "real-floating y"
.Ft int
.Fn islessequal "real-floating x" "real-floating y"
.Ft int
.Fn islessgreater "real-floating x" "real-floating y"
.Ft int
.Fn isunordered "real-floating x" "real-floating y"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Each of the macros
.Fn isgreater ,
.Fn isgreaterequal ,
.Fn isless ,
.Fn islessequal ,
and
.Fn islessgreater
take arguments
.Fa x
and
.Fa y
and return a non-zero value if and only if its nominal
relation on
.Fa x
and
.Fa y
is true.
These macros always return zero if either
argument is not a number (NaN), but unlike the corresponding C
operators, they never raise a floating point exception.
.Pp
The
.Fn isunordered
macro takes arguments
.Fa x
and
.Fa y
and returns non-zero if at least one of the arguments is NaN.
For any pair of floating-point values, one
of the relationships (less, greater, equal, unordered) holds.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr fpclassify 3
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn isgreater ,
.Fn isgreaterequal ,
.Fn isless ,
.Fn islessequal ,
.Fn islessgreater ,
and
.Fn isunordered
macros conform to
.St -isoC-99 .
.Sh HISTORY
The relational macros described above first appeared in
.Ox 4.4 .

@- man pages for fpclassify, isfinite, isinf, isnan, isnormal, signbit,
mostly from freebsd
- also describe deprecated aliases for isinff, isnanf, finite,
finitef
- describe behavior on vax
- add mlinks for finite, finitef, isfinite, isinf, isinff, isnan,
isnanf, isnormal, signbit
- add man pages for isgreater, isgreaterequal, isless, islessequal,
islessgreater, isunordered;  from freebsd
looked over by jmc@@, it's better for him to work on when they are in tree
