@Rebase on gdtoa-20110428;  contains fixes for absurdly long inputs
(among other things).  Fixes mozilla crasher for the link i was
provided with.

With the massive local changes to teach that malloc can fail, fixes
for the vax, strlcpy, moving things to library namespaces.  Tested
on all architectures.

@teach gdtoa & its subroutines that malloc can fail;  in which case
ecvt, fcvt, gcvt, *printf, strtof, strtod, strtold act per ieee
1003.1.  after these massive changes, remove unused files which
would not work now.  reported by Maksymilian Arciemowicz;  ok theo

1.1
log
@- replace dtoa w/ David's gdtoa, version 2008-03-15
- provide proper dtoa locks
- use the real strtof implementation
- add strtold, __hdtoa, __hldtoa
- add %a/%A support
- don't lose precision in printf, don't round to double anymore
- implement extended-precision versions of libc functions: fpclassify,
isnan, isinf, signbit, isnormal, isfinite, now that the ieee.h is
fixed
- separate vax versions of strtof, and __hdtoa
- add complex math support.  added functions: cacos, casin, catan,
ccos, csin, ctan, cacosh, casinh, catanh, ccosh, csinh, ctanh, cexp,
clog, cabs, cpow, csqrt, carg, cimag, conj, cproj, creal, cacosf,
casinf, catanf, ccosf, csinf, ctanf, cacoshf, casinhf, catanhf,
ccoshf, csinhf, ctanhf, cexpf, clogf, cabsf, cpowf, csqrtf, cargf,
cimagf, conjf, cprojf, crealf
- add fdim, fmax, fmin
- add log2. (adapted implementation e_log.c.  could be more acruate
& faster, but it's good enough for now)
- remove wrappers & cruft in libm, supposed to work-around mistakes
in SVID, etc.;  use ieee versions.  fixes issues in python 2.6 for
djm@@
- make _digittoint static
- proper definitions for i386, and amd64 in ieee.h
- sh, powerpc don't really have extended-precision
- add missing definitions for mips64 (quad), m{6,8}k (96-bit) float.h
for LDBL_*
- merge lead to frac for m{6,8}k, for gdtoa to work properly
- add FRAC*BITS & EXT_TO_ARRAY32 definitions in ieee.h, for hdtoa&ldtoa
to use
- add EXT_IMPLICIT_NBIT definition, which indicates implicit
normalization bit
- add regression tests for libc: fpclassify and printf
- arith.h & gd_qnan.h definitions
- update ieee.h: hppa doesn't have quad-precision, hppa64 does
- add missing prototypes to gdtoaimp
- on 64-bit platforms make sure gdtoa doesn't use a long when it
really wants an int
- etc., what i may have forgotten...
- bump libm major, due to removed&changed symbols
- no libc bump, since this is riding on djm's libc major crank from
a day ago

discussed with / requested by / testing theo, sthen@@, djm@@, jsg@@,
merdely@@, jsing@@, tedu@@, brad@@, jakemsr@@, and others.
looks good to millert@@
