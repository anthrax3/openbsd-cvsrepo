@Extended Attributes was a piece to get to ACLs, however ACLs have not
been worked on, so EA is pointless to maintain.

.Sh NAME
.Nm posix1e
.Nd introduction to the POSIX.1e security API
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The IEEE POSIX.1e specification never left draft form, but the interfaces
it describes are now widely used despite inherent limitations.
Currently, only a few of the interfaces and features are implemented in
.Ox ,
although efforts are underway to complete the integration at this time.
.Pp
POSIX.1e describes five security extensions to the base POSIX.1 API:
Access Control Lists (ACLs), Auditing, Capabilities, Mandatory Access
Control, and Information Flow Labels.
.Pp
POSIX.1e defines both syntax and semantics for these features, but fairly
substantial changes are required to implement these features in the
operating system.
.Sh IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
.Fx Ns 's
support for POSIX.1e interfaces and features is still under
development at this time.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
POSIX.1e assigns security labels to all objects, extending the security
functionality described in POSIX.1.
These additional labels provide fine-grained discretionary access control,
fine-grained capabilities,
and labels necessary for mandatory access control.
POSIX.2c describes
a set of userland utilities for manipulating these labels.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr extattr 9
.Sh STANDARDS
POSIX.1e is described in IEEE POSIX.1e draft 17.
Discussion of the draft continues on the cross-platform POSIX.1e implementation
mailing list.
To join this list, see the
.Ox
POSIX.1e implementation
page for more information.
.Sh HISTORY
POSIX.1e support was introduced in
.Ox 3.1
and development continues.
.Sh AUTHORS
.An Robert N M Watson
.An Chris D. Faulhaber
.An Thomas Moestl
.An Ilmar S Habibulin
.Sh BUGS
These features are not yet fully implemented.
