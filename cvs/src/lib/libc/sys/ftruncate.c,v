@_FD_LOCK/UNLOCK() is libpthread specific and not needed for librthread, so
isolate its usage to libpthread only and replace with generic non-static
mutex support in the one place it is needed:
 - remove _FD_LOCK/UNLOCK from lseek and ftruncate in libc and make the
   functions weak so that libpthread can override with its own new
   versions that do the locking.
 - remove _thread_fd_lock/unlock() weak functions from libc and adjust
   libpthread for the change.
 - add generic _thread_mutex_lock/unlock/destroy() weak functions in libc
   to support non-static mutexes in libc and add libpthread and librthread
   implementations for them. libc can utilize non-static mutexes via the
   new _MUTEX_LOCK/UNLOCK/DESTROY() macros. Actually these new macros can
   support both static and non-static mutexes but currently only using
   them for non-static.
 - make opendir/closedir/readdir/readdir_r/seekdir/telldir() thread-safe
   for both thread libraries by using a non-static mutex in the struct
   _dirdesc (typedef DIR), utilizing it in the *dir functions and remove
   remaining and incorrect _FD_LOCK/UNLOCK() use in libc.
 - add comments to both thread libraries to indicate libc depends on the
   current implementation of static mutex initialization. suggested by
   marc@@
 - major bump libc and libpthread due to function removal, structure
   change and weak symbol conversions.
