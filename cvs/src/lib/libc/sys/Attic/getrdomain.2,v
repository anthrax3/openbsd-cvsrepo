@Fix the naming of interfaces and variables for rdomains and rtables
and make it possible to bind sockets (including listening sockets!)
to rtables and not just rdomains.  This changes the name of the
system calls, socket option, and ioctl.  After building with this
you should remove the files /usr/share/man/cat2/[gs]etrdomain.0.

Since this removes the existing [gs]etrdomain() system calls, the
libc major is bumped.
