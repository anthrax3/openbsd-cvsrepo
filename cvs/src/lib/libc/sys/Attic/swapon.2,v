@move this file to Attic; the swapon(2) system call cannot be accessed
from userland since April 2003 and, of course, the manual page is
not built either.

see miod@@'s change in r1.66 of src/lib/libc/sys/Makefile.inc.

i would like to acknowledge the excellent advice from jmc@@ and
fgsch@@ with relation to this change.

ok miod@@

.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm swapon
.Nd add a swap device for interleaved paging/swapping
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <unistd.h>
.Ft int
.Fn swapon "const char *special"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn swapon
makes the block device
.Fa special
available to the system for allocation for paging and swapping.
The names of potentially available devices are known to the system and
defined at system configuration time.
The size of the swap area on
.Fa special
is calculated at the time the device is first made available for swapping.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
If an error has occurred, a value of \-1 is returned and
.Va errno
is set to indicate the error.
.Sh ERRORS
.Fn swapon
succeeds unless:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er ENOTDIR
A component of the path prefix is not a directory.
.It Bq Er ENAMETOOLONG
A component of a pathname exceeded
.Dv {NAME_MAX}
characters, or an entire path name exceeded
.Dv {PATH_MAX}
characters.
.It Bq Er ENOENT
The named device does not exist.
.It Bq Er EACCES
Search permission is denied for a component of the path prefix.
.It Bq Er ELOOP
Too many symbolic links were encountered in translating the pathname.
.It Bq Er EPERM
The caller is not the superuser.
.It Bq Er ENOTBLK
.Fa special
is not a block device.
.It Bq Er EBUSY
The device specified by
.Fa special
has already been made available for swapping
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The device configured by
.Fa special
was not configured into the system as a swap device.
.It Bq Er ENXIO
The major device number of
.Fa special
is out of range (this indicates no device driver exists
for the associated hardware).
.It Bq Er EIO
An I/O error occurred while opening the swap device.
.It Bq Er EFAULT
.Fa special
points outside the process's allocated address space.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr config 8 ,
.Xr swapon 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Fn swapon
function call appeared in
.Bx 4.0 .
.Sh BUGS
There is no way to stop swapping on a disk so that the pack may be
dismounted.
.Pp
This call will be upgraded in future versions of the system.
