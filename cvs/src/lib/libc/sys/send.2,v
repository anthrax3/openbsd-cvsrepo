.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm send ,
.Nm sendto ,
.Nm sendmsg
.Nd send a message from a socket
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/socket.h
.Ft ssize_t
.Fn send "int s" "const void *msg" "size_t len" "int flags"
.Ft ssize_t
.Fn sendto "int s" "const void *msg" "size_t len" "int flags" "const struct sockaddr *to" "socklen_t tolen"
.Ft ssize_t
.Fn sendmsg "int s" "const struct msghdr *msg" "int flags"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn send ,
.Fn sendto ,
and
.Fn sendmsg
are used to transmit a message to another socket.
.Fn send
may be used only when the socket is in a
.Em connected
state, while
.Fn sendto
and
.Fn sendmsg
may be used at any time.
.Pp
The address of the target is given by
.Fa to
with
.Fa tolen
specifying its size.
The length of the message is given by
.Fa len .
If the message is too long to pass atomically through the
underlying protocol, the error
.Er EMSGSIZE
is returned, and
the message is not transmitted.
.Pp
No indication of failure to deliver is implicit in a
.Fn send .
Locally detected errors are indicated by a return value of \-1.
.Pp
If no messages space is available at the socket to hold
the message to be transmitted, then
.Fn send
normally blocks, unless the socket has been placed in
non-blocking I/O mode.
The
.Xr select 2
or
.Xr poll 2
system calls may be used to determine when it is possible to
send more data.
.Pp
The
.Fa flags
parameter may include one or more of the following:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "MSG_DONTROUTEXX" -offset indent -compact
.It Dv MSG_DONTROUTE
bypass routing tables, silently ignored
.It Dv MSG_DONTWAIT
don't block
.It Dv MSG_EOR
terminate the record (SOCK_SEQPACKET only)
.It Dv MSG_NOSIGNAL
don't send
.Dv SIGPIPE
.It Dv MSG_OOB
process out-of-band data
.El
.Pp
The flag
.Dv MSG_OOB
is used to send
.Dq out-of-band
data on sockets that support this notion (e.g.,
.Dv SOCK_STREAM ) ;
the underlying protocol must also support
.Dq out-of-band
data.
.Dv MSG_NOSIGNAL
is used to request not to send the
.Dv SIGPIPE
signal if an attempt to send is made on a socket that is shut down for
writing or no longer connected.
.Pp
See
.Xr recv 2
for a description of the
.Fa msghdr
structure.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The call returns the number of characters sent, or \-1
if an error occurred.
.Sh ERRORS
.Fn send ,
.Fn sendto ,
and
.Fn sendmsg
fail if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EBADF
An invalid descriptor was specified.
.It Bq Er ENOTSOCK
The argument
.Fa s
is not a socket.
.It Bq Er EFAULT
An invalid user space address was specified for a parameter.
.It Bq Er EMSGSIZE
The socket requires that message be sent atomically,
and the size of the message to be sent made this impossible.
.It Bq Er EAGAIN
The socket is marked non-blocking or the
.Dv MSG_DONTWAIT
flag is set and the requested operation
would block.
.It Bq Er ENOBUFS
The system was unable to allocate an internal buffer.
The operation may succeed when buffers become available.
.It Bq Er ENOBUFS
The output queue for a network interface was full.
This generally indicates that the interface has stopped sending,
but may be caused by transient congestion.
.It Bq Er EACCES
The
.Dv SO_BROADCAST
option is not set on the socket, and a broadcast address
was given as the destination.
.It Bq Er EHOSTUNREACH
The destination address specified an unreachable host.
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The
.Fa flags
parameter is invalid.
.It Bq Er EHOSTDOWN
The destination address specified a host that is down.
.It Bq Er ENETDOWN
The destination address specified a network that is down.
.It Bq Er ECONNREFUSED
The destination host rejected the message (or a previous one).
This error can only be returned by connected sockets.
.It Bq Er ENOPROTOOPT
There was a problem sending the message.
This error can only be returned by connected sockets.
.It Bq Er EDESTADDRREQ
The socket is not connected, and no destination address was specified.
.It Bq Er EPIPE
The socket is shut down for writing or not longer connected and the
.Dv MSG_NOSIGNAL
flag is set.
.El
.Pp
In addition,
.Fn send
and
.Fn sendto
may return the following error:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EINVAL
.Fa len
was larger than
.Dv SSIZE_MAX .
.El
.Pp
.Fn sendto
and
.Fn sendmsg
may return the following errors:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EAFNOSUPPORT
Addresses in the specified address family cannot be used with this socket.
.It Bq Er EISCONN
The socket is already connected, and a destination address was specified.
.El
.Pp
.Fn sendmsg
may return the following errors:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The sum of the
.Fa iov_len
values in the
.Fa msg_iov
array overflowed an
.Em ssize_t .
.It Bq Er EMSGSIZE
The
.Fa msg_iovlen
member of
.Fa msg
was less than 0 or larger than
.Dv IOV_MAX .
.It Bq Er EMFILE
The message contains control information utilizing
.Xr CMSG_DATA 3
to pass file descriptors, but too many file descriptors
are already in-flight.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr fcntl 2 ,
.Xr getsockopt 2 ,
.Xr poll 2 ,
.Xr recv 2 ,
.Xr select 2 ,
.Xr socket 2 ,
.Xr write 2 ,
.Xr CMSG_DATA 3
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn send ,
.Fn sendto ,
and
.Fn sendmsg
functions conform to
.St -p1003.1-2008 .
The
.Dv MSG_DONTWAIT
and
.Dv MSG_NOSIGNAL
flags are extensions to that specification.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Fn send
function call appeared in
.Bx 4.2 .

@Retire kernel support for SO_DONTROUTE, this time without breaking
localhost connections.

The plan is to always use the routing table for addresses and routes
resolutions, so there is no future for an option that wants to bypass
it.  This option has never been implemented for IPv6 anyway, so let's
just remove the IPv4 bits that you weren't aware of.

@For read, write, send, sendto, recv, recvfrom return EINVAL is size arg > SSIZE_MAX.  For readv, writev, sendmsg, recvmsg return EINVAL if sum of the  over iov_len values overflows an ssize_t.  Based on what XPG 4.2 says (though XPG is not entirely consistent here).  Basically since the return value is ssize_t allowing size > SSIZE_MAX is bad since people who (incorrectly mind you) check the return value for < 0 instead of == -1 will have bad things happen to them.
