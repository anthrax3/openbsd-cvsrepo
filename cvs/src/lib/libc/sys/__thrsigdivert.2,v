.Dt __THRSIGDIVERT 2
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm __thrsigdivert
.Nd synchronously accept a signal
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/signal.h
.In sys/time.h
.Ft int
.Fn __thrsigdivert "sigset_t set" "siginfo_t *info" "const struct timespec *timeout"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn __thrsigdivert
function is used to implement
.Fn sigwait .
It selects a signal pending for the calling thread or process from
.Fa set ,
atomically clears it from that set of pending signals,
and returns that signal number.
If prior to the call to
.Fn __thrsigdivert
there are multiple pending instances of a single signal number,
it is undefined whether upon successful return there are any remaining
pending signals for that signal number.
If no signal in
.Fa set
is pending at the time of the call,
the thread shall be suspended until one or more becomes pending.
The signals defined by
.Fa set
should have been blocked in all threads in the process at the time
of the call to
.Fn __thrsigdivert ;
otherwise the signal may be delivered to some thread that does not
have it blocked.
.Pp
If more than one thread is using
.Fn __thrsigdivert
to wait for the same signal,
no more than one of these threads shall return from
.Fn __thrsigdivert
for any given signal that is sent.
Which thread returns from
.Fn __thrsigdivert
if more than a single thread is waiting is unspecified.
.Pp
If the
.Fa info
argument is not
.Dv NULL ,
then a
.Vt siginfo_t
will be stored there which has the selected signal number in its
.Fa si_signo
member and the cause of the signal in its
.Fa si_code
member.
.Pp
If the
.Fa timeout
argument is not
.Dv NULL
and no selected signal is currently pending,
then
.Fn __thrsigdivert
will wait no longer than the specified time period for a signal to
arrive before failing.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
If successful,
the number of the signal that was accepted is returned.
Otherwise, a value of -1 is returned and
.Dv errno
is set to indicate the error.
.Sh ERRORS
.Fn __thrsigdivert
will succeed unless:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EWOULDBLOCK
The timeout was reached before a selected signal was received.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr sigaction 2 ,
.Xr sigprocmask 2 ,
.Xr sigwait 3
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Fn __thrsigdivert
function is specific to
.Ox
and should not be used in portable applications.
.Sh HISTORY
A
.Fn thrsigdivert
syscall appeared in
.Ox 3.9 .
The
.Fa info
and
.Fa timeout
arguments were added in
.Ox 4.9 .
.Sh AUTHORS
.An -nosplit
The
.Fn thrsigdivert
syscall was created by
.An Ted Unangst Aq Mt tedu@@OpenBSD.org .
