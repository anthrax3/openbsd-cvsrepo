@Retire hp300, mvme68k and mvme88k ports. These ports have no users, keeping
this hardware alive is becoming increasingly difficult, and I should heed the
message sent by the three disks which have died on me over the last few days.

Noone sane will mourn these ports anyway. So long, and thanks for the fish.

log
@Userland bits for m68k/ELF. Mostly addition of register prefixes to the
assembler instructions, and cope with the few changes in return values
location.

1.2
log
@Convert cpp | as rules in bsd.lib.mk and lib/libc/sys/Makefile.inc to pure cc
invocations.  This allows us to use the compiler builtin define __PIC__ to check
for PIC/PIEness rather than passing -DPIC.  Simplifies PIE work a lot.

log
@Use __tfork, __get_tcb, and __set_tcb to have a real TCB and per-thread
errno.  The ASM bits for _cerror are sketchy or missing for some archs
but that can be corrected in-tree.
