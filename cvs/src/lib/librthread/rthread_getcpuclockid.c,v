1.2
log
@Use a Thread Information Block in both single and multi-threaded programs.
This stores errno, the cancelation flags, and related bits for each thread
and is allocated by ld.so or libc.a.  This is an ABI break from 5.9-stable!

Make libpthread dlopen'able by moving the cancelation wrappers into libc
and doing locking and fork/errno handling via callbacks that libpthread
registers when it first initializes.  'errno' *must* be declared via
<errno.h> now!

Clean up libpthread's symbol exports like libc.

On powerpc, offset the TIB/TCB/TLS data from the register per the ELF spec.

@Add support for the _POSIX_CPUTIME and _POSIX_THREAD_CPUTIME options,
including CLOCK_{PROCESS,THREAD}_CPUTIME_ID constants and
{clock,pthread}_getcpuclockid() functions.

Worked out at t2k13 with help from tedu@@ and matthew@@ and testing by aja@@
