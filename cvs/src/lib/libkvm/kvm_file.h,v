@Mark internal symbols as hidden.  This removes symbols from the ABI,
albeit ones no one should be using, so major bump the shlib.

1.1
log
@Prep for hidden visibility: move the vnode/file related function
declarations, including _kvm_getftype(), into a new header, kvm_file.h,
so that we don't have to pull <sys/vnode.h> into all the .c files.  No
more extern function declaration in .c files.
