.Dt KVM_READ 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm kvm_read ,
.Nm kvm_write
.Nd read or write kernel virtual memory
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In kvm.h
.Ft ssize_t
.Fn kvm_read "kvm_t *kd" "u_long addr" "void *buf" "size_t nbytes"
.Ft ssize_t
.Fn kvm_write "kvm_t *kd" "u_long addr" "const void *buf" "size_t nbytes"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn kvm_read
and
.Fn kvm_write
functions are used to read and write kernel virtual memory (or a crash
dump file).
See
.Xr kvm_open 3
for information regarding opening kernel virtual memory and crash dumps.
.Pp
The
.Fn kvm_read
function transfers
.Fa nbytes
bytes of data from
the kernel space address
.Fa addr
to
.Fa buf .
Conversely,
.Fn kvm_write
transfers data from
.Fa buf
to
.Fa addr .
Unlike their SunOS counterparts, these functions cannot be used to
read or write process address spaces.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion, the number of bytes actually transferred is
returned.
Otherwise, \-1 is returned.

.Xr kvm_geterr 3 ,

@- remove all trailing whitespace
     * except when it is escaped with a `\' at the end of the line
- fix remaining .Nm usage as well
- this is from a patch I received from kwesterback@@home.com, who has been
  working on some scripts for fixing formatting errors in mdoc'd man pages

Ok, so there could be a cost/benefit debate with this commit, but since I have
the patch we might as well commit it...
