@Goodbye, MIT pthreads... you were a handy reference implementation

@This port to Osr5 was donated by 
    ARTURO MONTES    mitosys@@colomsat.net.co
Its a snapshot of the 1.60 Beta 5 version 

It passes all the tests except test_fork (this seems to be  a problem 
with  the MIT source)
and  I suspect there may also  to be problems with 
the floating point initialisation and perhaps the netdb access as well


Regarding the networking API's mind the following (ARTURO):

- Always we are searching host address in /etc/hosts by default, if you
want other behaviour let me to know.

- If you haven't an entry in /etc/hosts, please create it and after test
with DNS service.

regarding floating point initialisation (ARTURO)

...mit-pthreads/pthreads/tests> ./test_preemption_float
test_preemption_float INDETERMINATE

I inhibit the pthread float code, but they are a minor changes in machdep.c.

> What did you do/needs to be done here ??

Look into machdep.c machdep_save_float_state() and
machdep_restore_float_state() routine. I think the initialization float
code can have problems with pthread initialization code.

----------------


If you wish to rebuild from source you'll need the gnus devsys
(gmake and gcc) and don't use configure to reconfigure the makefiles, etc
    ( I don't know why this is but it doesn't work)

If Arturo keeps me updated with buildable snapshots I'll endeavour to keep
the skunkware Website updated with them.


Best of luck

@Complete initial import from mySQL 3.22.4 (mit-pthreads/).
Lots of dross to move and remove yet.

At minimum:
o	remove GNU config and GNU Makefiles
o	build arch directory and migrate away machdep/
o	rebuild BSD Makefiles
o	move notes etc. into doc/
