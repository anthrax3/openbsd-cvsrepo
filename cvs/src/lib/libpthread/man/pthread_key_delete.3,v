.Dt PTHREAD_KEY_DELETE 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm pthread_key_delete
.Nd delete a thread-specific data key
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In pthread.h
.Ft int
.Fn pthread_key_delete "pthread_key_t key"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn pthread_key_delete
function deletes a thread-specific data key previously returned by
.Fn pthread_key_create .
The thread-specific data values associated with
.Fa key
need not be NULL at the time that
.Fn pthread_key_delete
is called.
It is the responsibility of the application to free any
application storage or perform any cleanup actions for data structures
related to the deleted key or associated thread-specific data in any threads;
this cleanup can be done either before or after
.Fn pthread_key_delete
is called.
Any attempt to use
.Fa key
following the call to
.Fn pthread_key_delete
results in undefined behavior.
.Pp
The
.Fn pthread_key_delete
function is callable from within destructor functions.
Destructor functions are not invoked by
.Fn pthread_key_delete .
Any destructor function that may have been associated with
.Fa key
will no longer be called upon thread exit.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
If successful, the
.Fn pthread_key_delete
function will return zero.
Otherwise an error number will be returned to indicate the error.
.Sh ERRORS
.Fn pthread_key_delete
will fail if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The
.Fa key
value is invalid.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr pthread_getspecific 3 ,
.Xr pthread_key_create 3 ,
.Xr pthread_setspecific 3
.Sh STANDARDS
.Fn pthread_key_delete
conforms to
.St -p1003.1-96 .
