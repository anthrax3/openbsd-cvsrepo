@move unchanged files from machdep/ into appropriate arch/${MACHINE}
directories. These files have been renamed as appropriate, but
hackers of these files should note those that started off as netbsd
files (alpha and sparc).

also moved machdep/openbsd-2.0/ to include/sys/

@Complete initial import from mySQL 3.22.4 (mit-pthreads/).
Lots of dross to move and remove yet.

At minimum:
o	remove GNU config and GNU Makefiles
o	build arch directory and migrate away machdep/
o	rebuild BSD Makefiles
o	move notes etc. into doc/
