@Goodbye, MIT pthreads... you were a handy reference implementation
@
text
@This directory contains a few test and benchmark programs that I've 
developed to help me test the consistancy of the libpthread.a. 

TEST
----------------------
test_create		Tests the pthread_create() routine. The stack addresses
				should be very different (ie the upper values of the
				address should be different) and the arg should be
				0xdeadbeaf.

test_switch		A nondeterministic test. It should show context switching,
				by displaying different letters.

test_sleep		Timing this test should result in a time of about 20 seconds.
				It should sleep for 10 seconds and then print ba 10 times
				at the rate of about once a second.

p_bench_*		Benchmarks for various routines.

@Complete initial import from mySQL 3.22.4 (mit-pthreads/).
Lots of dross to move and remove yet.

At minimum:
o	remove GNU config and GNU Makefiles
o	build arch directory and migrate away machdep/
o	rebuild BSD Makefiles
o	move notes etc. into doc/
