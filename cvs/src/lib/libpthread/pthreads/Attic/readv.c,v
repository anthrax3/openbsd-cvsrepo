1.2
log
@o removed more unused or old, left over files

o general changes so that now the library compiles and many of the
  tests run correctly

o pthreads/Makefile.inc rebuilt using libc/sys/Makefile.inc as a template.
  this should be kept in sync in case of new syscalls

soon TODO:
figure out why remaining tests fail and fix
look at building .so version of library
tidy up arch/i386 directory - no longer uses syscall-template.S
port other arch's from libc syscall templates

1.1.1.1
log
@Complete initial import from mySQL 3.22.4 (mit-pthreads/).
Lots of dross to move and remove yet.

At minimum:
o	remove GNU config and GNU Makefiles
o	build arch directory and migrate away machdep/
o	rebuild BSD Makefiles
o	move notes etc. into doc/
