@o removed more unused or old, left over files

o general changes so that now the library compiles and many of the
  tests run correctly

o pthreads/Makefile.inc rebuilt using libc/sys/Makefile.inc as a template.
  this should be kept in sync in case of new syscalls

soon TODO:
figure out why remaining tests fail and fix
look at building .so version of library
tidy up arch/i386 directory - no longer uses syscall-template.S
port other arch's from libc syscall templates
