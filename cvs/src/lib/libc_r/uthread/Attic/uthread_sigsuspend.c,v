1.5
log
@Start syncing with FreeBSD:

o Implement _get_curthread() and _set_curthread(). Use it where possible.
o Add missing _thread_[enter|leave]_cancellation_point().
o Add a couple of not yet used vars to pthread_private.h.
o Remove return's from void functions.

This is by no means complete, but instead of doing a big commit, i'll
split it in small ones, minimizing diffs.
