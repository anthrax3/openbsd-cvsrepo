	 *  ones [_SPINLOCK_LOCKED]. The operation is performed
	 *  atomically, that is, without allowing intervening interrupts
	 *  or deferred traps. In a multiprocessor system, two or more
	 *  processors executing atomic load-store unsigned byte [...]
	 *  addressing the same byte [...] simultaneously are guaranteed
	 *  to execute them in an undefined, but serial order."

	 * "LDSTUB loads a byte value from memory to a register and writes
	 *  the value FF_16 into the addressed byte atomically. LDSTUB
	 *  is the classic test-and-set instruction. Like SWAP, it has
	 *  a consensus number of two and so cannot resolve more than
	 *  two contending processes in a wait-free fashion."

@Enough for libc_r on sparc64 to build (this stuff is mostly taken from sparc,
and will need attention before it can be expected to work).
