@TEST has moved to regress/lib/libc_r.

text
@This directory contains a few test and benchmark programs that I've 
developed to help me test the consistancy of the libpthread.a. 

TEST
----------------------
test_create		Tests the pthread_create() routine. The stack addresses
				should be very different (ie the upper values of the
				address should be different) and the arg should be
				0xdeadbeaf.

test_switch		A nondeterministic test. It should show context switching,
				by displaying different letters.

test_sleep		Timing this test should result in a time of about 20 seconds.
				It should sleep for 10 seconds and then print ba 10 times
				at the rate of about once a second.

p_bench_*		Benchmarks for various routines.
