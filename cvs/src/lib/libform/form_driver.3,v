@Update to ncurses 5.7, with local changes reapplied.

This is around eight years worth of changes (previously we were around ncurses
5.2), too many to list - many bug fixes and also a few new functions.

A major bump for libcurses, libpanel, libform and libmenu.

.TH form_driver 3 ""
.SH NAME
\fBform_driver\fR - command-processing loop of the form system
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB#include <form.h>\fR
.br
int form_driver(FORM *form, int c);
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
Once a form has been posted (displayed), you should funnel input events to it
through \fBform_driver\fR.  This routine has three major input cases:
.TP 3
-
The input is a form navigation request.
Navigation request codes are constants defined in \fB<form.h>\fP,
which are distinct from the key- and character codes returned by \fBwgetch\fP.
.TP 3
-
The input is a printable character.
Printable characters (which must be positive, less than 256) are
checked according to the program's locale settings.
.TP 3
-
The input is the KEY_MOUSE special key associated with an mouse event.
.PP
The form driver requests are as follows:
.TP 5
REQ_NEXT_PAGE
Move to the next page.
.TP 5
REQ_PREV_PAGE

.sp
.TP 5

.TP 5
REQ_INS_LINE

.TP 5
REQ_DEL_CHAR

.TP 5
REQ_DEL_PREV
Delete character before the cursor.
.TP 5
REQ_DEL_LINE
Delete line at the cursor.
.TP 5
REQ_DEL_WORD
Delete blank-delimited word at the cursor.
.TP 5
REQ_CLR_EOL
Clear to end of line from cursor.
.TP 5
REQ_CLR_EOF

.TP 5
REQ_CLR_FIELD
Clear the entire field.
.TP 5
REQ_OVL_MODE
Enter overlay mode.
.TP 5
REQ_INS_MODE

.sp
.TP 5
REQ_SCR_FLINE

.TP 5
REQ_SCR_BLINE

.TP 5
REQ_SCR_BPAGE

.sp
.TP 5

.TP 5
REQ_SCR_BCHAR
Scroll the field backward a character.
.TP 5
REQ_SCR_HFLINE
Horizontal scroll the field forward a line.
.TP 5
REQ_SCR_HBLINE
Horizontal scroll the field backward a line.
.TP 5
REQ_SCR_HFHALF
Horizontal scroll the field forward half a line.
.TP 5
REQ_SCR_HBHALF
Horizontal scroll the field backward half a line.
.sp
.TP
REQ_VALIDATION
Validate field.
.TP
REQ_NEXT_CHOICE
Display next field choice.
.TP
REQ_PREV_CHOICE
Display previous field choice.
.PP
If the second argument is a printable character, the driver places it
in the current position in the current field.  If it is one of the forms
requests listed above, that request is executed.
.SS MOUSE HANDLING
.PP
If the second argument is the KEY_MOUSE special key, the associated
mouse event is translated into one of the above pre-defined requests.
Currently only clicks in the user window (e.g. inside the form display
area or the decoration window) are handled.
.PP
If you click above the display region of the form:
.RS
.TP
a REQ_PREV_FIELD is generated for a single click,
.TP
a REQ_PREV_PAGE is generated for a double-click and
.TP
a REQ_FIRST_FIELD is generated for a triple-click.
.RE
.PP
If you click below the display region of the form:
.RS
.TP
a REQ_NEXT_FIELD is generated for a single click,
.TP
a REQ_NEXT_PAGE is generated for a double-click and
.TP
a REQ_LAST_FIELD is generated for a triple-click.
.RE
.PP
If you click at an field inside the display area of the form:
.RS
.TP 3
-
the form cursor is positioned to that field.
.TP 3
-
If you double-click a field,
the form cursor is positioned to that field
and \fBE_UNKNOWN_COMMAND\fR is returned.
This return value makes sense,
because a double click usually means that an field-specific action should
be returned.
It is exactly the purpose of this return value to signal that an
application specific command should be executed.
.TP 3
-
If a translation
into a request was done, \fBform_driver\fR returns the result of this request.
.RE
.PP
If you clicked outside the user window or the mouse event could not be translated
into a form request an \fBE_REQUEST_DENIED\fR is returned.
.SS APPLICATION-DEFINED COMMANDS
.PP
If the second argument is neither printable nor one of the above
pre-defined form requests, the driver assumes it is an application-specific
command and returns \fBE_UNKNOWN_COMMAND\fR.  Application-defined commands
should be defined relative to \fBMAX_COMMAND\fR, the maximum value of these
pre-defined requests.
.SH RETURN VALUE
\fBform_driver\fR returns one of the following error codes:
.TP 5
.B E_OK
The routine succeeded.
.TP 5
.B E_BAD_ARGUMENT
Routine detected an incorrect or out-of-range argument.
.TP 5
.B E_BAD_STATE
Routine was called from an initialization or termination function.
.TP 5
.B E_NOT_POSTED
The form has not been posted.
.TP 5
.B E_INVALID_FIELD
Contents of field is invalid.
.TP 5
.B E_REQUEST_DENIED
The form driver could not process the request.
.TP 5
.B E_SYSTEM_ERROR
System error occurred (see \fBerrno\fR).
.TP 5
.B E_UNKNOWN_COMMAND
The form driver code saw an unknown request code.
.
.SH SEE ALSO

\fBform\fR(3),
\fBwgetch\fR(3).
.SH NOTES
The header file \fB<form.h>\fR automatically includes the header files
\fB<curses.h>\fR.
.SH PORTABILITY
These routines emulate the System V forms library.  They were not supported on
Version 7 or BSD versions.
