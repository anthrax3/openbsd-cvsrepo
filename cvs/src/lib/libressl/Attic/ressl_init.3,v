@Rename libressl to libtls to avoid confusion and to make it easier to
distinguish between LibreSSL (the project) and libressl (the library).

Discussed with many.

.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm ressl
family of functions establishes a secure communications channel
using the TLS socket protocol.
Both clients and servers are supported.
.Pp
The
.Fn ressl_init
function should be called once before any function is used.
.Pp
Before a connection is created, a configuration must be created.
The
.Fn ressl_config_new
function returns a new default configuration that can be used for future
connections.
Several functions exist to change the options of the configuration; see below.
.Pp
A
.Em ressl
connection is represented as a
.Em context .
A new
.Em context
is created by either the
.Fn ressl_client
or
.Fn ressl_server
functions.
The context can then be configured with the function
.Fn ressl_configure .
The same
.Em ressl_config
object can be used to configure multiple contexts.
.Pp
A client connection is initiated after configuration by calling
.Fn ressl_connect .
This function will create a new socket, connect to the specified host and
port, and then establish a secure connection.
An already existing socket can be upgraded to a secure connection by calling
.Fn ressl_connect_socket .
.Pp
Two functions are provided for input and output,
.Fn ressl_read
and
.Fn ressl_write .
.Pp
After use, a ressl
.Em context
should be closed with
.Fn ressl_close ,
and then freed by calling
.Fn ressl_free .
When no more contexts are to be created, the
.Em ressl_config
object should be freed by calling
.Fn ressl_config_free .
.Sh FUNCTIONS
The
.Fn ressl_init
function initializes global data structures.
It should be called once before any other functions.
.Pp
The following functions create and free configuration objects.
.Bl -bullet -offset four
.It
.Fn ressl_config_new
allocates a new default configuration object.
.It
.Fn ressl_config_free
frees a configuration object.
.El
.Pp
The following functions modify a configuration by setting parameters.
Configuration options may apply to only clients or only servers or both.
.Bl -bullet -offset four
.It
.Fn ressl_config_set_ca_file
sets the filename used to load a file
containing the root certificates.
.Em (Client)
.It
.Fn ressl_config_set_ca_path
sets the path (directory) which should be searched for root
certificates.
.Em (Client)
.It
.Fn ressl_config_set_cert_file
sets file from which the public certificate will be read.
.Em (Client and server)
.It
.Fn ressl_config_set_cert_mem
sets the public certificate directly from memory.
.Em (Client and server)
.It
.Fn ressl_config_set_ciphers
sets the list of ciphers that may be used.
.Em (Client and server)
.It
.Fn ressl_config_set_key_file
sets the file from which the private key will be read.
.Em (Server)
.It
.Fn ressl_config_set_key_mem
directly sets the private key from memory.
.Em (Server)
.It
.Fn ressl_config_set_protocols
sets which versions of the protocol may be used.
Possible values are the bitwise OR of:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "RESSL_PROTOCOL_TLSv1_2" -offset indent -compact
.It Dv RESSL_PROTOCOL_TLSv1_0
.It Dv RESSL_PROTOCOL_TLSv1_1
.It Dv RESSL_PROTOCOL_TLSv1_2
.El
.Pp
Additionally, the values
.Dv RESSL_PROTOCOL_TLSv1
(all TLS versions) and
.Dv RESSL_PROTOCOLS_DEFAULT
(currently all TLS versions) may be used.
.Em (Client and server)
.It
.Fn ressl_config_clear_keys
clears any secret keys from memory.
.Em (Server)
.It
.Fn ressl_config_insecure_noverifyhost
disables hostname verification.
Be careful when using this option.
.Em (Client)
.It
.Fn ressl_config_insecure_noverifycert
disables certificate verification.
Be extremely careful when using this option.
.Em (Client)
.It
.Fn ressl_config_verify
reenables hostname and certificate verification.
.Em (Client)
.El
.Pp
The following functions create, prepare, and free a connection context.
.Bl -bullet -offset four
.It
.Fn ressl_client
creates a new ressl context for client connections.
.It
.Fn ressl_server
creates a new ressl context for server connections.
.It
.Fn ressl_configure
readies a ressl context for use by applying the configuration
options.
.It
.Fn ressl_close
closes a connection after use.
.It
.Fn ressl_free
frees a ressl context after use.
.El
.Pp
The following functions initiate a connection and perform input and output
operations.
.Bl -bullet -offset four
.It
.Fn ressl_connect
connects a client context to the server named by
.Fa host .
The
.Fa port
may be numeric or a service name.
If it is NULL then a host of the format "hostname:port" is permitted.
.It
.Fn ressl_connect_socket
connects a client context to an already established socket connection.
.It
.Fn ressl_read
reads
.Fa buflen
bytes of data from the socket into
.Fa buf .
The amount of data read is returned in
.Fa outlen .
.It
.Fn ressl_write
writes
.Fa buflen
bytes of data from
.Fa buf
to the socket.
The amount of data written is returned in
.Fa outlen .
.El
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Functions that return
.Vt int
will return 0 on success and -1 on error.
Functions that return a pointer will return NULL on error.
.\" .Sh ERRORS
.\" .Sh SEE ALSO
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm ressl
API first appeared in
.Ox 5.6
as a response to the unnecessary challenges other APIs present in
order to use them safely.

@Fuck it. No SSLv3; not now, not ever. The API of the future will only
support the protocols of the future.

(Perhaps a bit late in burning this bridge entirely, but there's no time
like the present, esp. with other players now leaning against back compat.)
