@Rename libressl to libtls to avoid confusion and to make it easier to
distinguish between LibreSSL (the project) and libressl (the library).

Discussed with many.

log
@Initial version of libressl - a library that provides a clean, simple,
consistent and secure-by-default API for SSL clients (and soon servers).

This is a long way from complete and the interface will likely change
substantially - committing now so that further work can happen in the tree.

Initiated by tedu@@ and inspired by discussions with tedu@@, beck@@ and
other developers.
