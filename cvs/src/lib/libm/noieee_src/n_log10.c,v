/* LOG10(X)
 * RETURN THE BASE 10 LOGARITHM OF x
 * DOUBLE PRECISION (VAX D format 56 bits, IEEE DOUBLE 53 BITS)
 * CODED IN C BY K.C. NG, 1/20/85;
 * REVISED BY K.C. NG on 1/23/85, 3/7/85, 4/16/85.
 *
 * Required kernel function:
 *	log(x)
 *
 * Method :
 *			     log(x)
 *		log10(x) = ---------  or  [1/log(10)]*log(x)
 *			    log(10)
 *
 *    Note:
 *	  [log(10)]   rounded to 56 bits has error  .0895  ulps,
 *	  [1/log(10)] rounded to 53 bits has error  .198   ulps;
 *	  therefore, for better accuracy, in VAX D format, we divide
 *	  log(x) by log(10), but in IEEE Double format, we multiply
 *	  log(x) by [1/log(10)].
 *
 * Special cases:
 *	log10(x) is NaN with signal if x < 0;
 *	log10(+INF) is +INF with no signal; log10(0) is -INF with signal;
 *	log10(NaN) is that NaN with no signal.
 *
 * Accuracy:
 *	log10(X) returns the exact log10(x) nearly rounded. In a test run
 *	with 1,536,000 random arguments on a VAX, the maximum observed
 *	error was 1.74 ulps (units in the last place).
 *
 * Constants:
 * The hexadecimal values are the intended ones for the following constants.
 * The decimal values may be used, provided that the compiler will convert
 * from decimal to binary accurately enough to produce the hexadecimal values
 * shown.

@in the old days compiler could not convert decimal constants
accurately, hence the tricks in libm, using machine representation
of constants.  remove kludges and switch to use decimal constants,
much simplifying the code.  since, the compiler converts them
accurately.  generated values match on vaxfp
