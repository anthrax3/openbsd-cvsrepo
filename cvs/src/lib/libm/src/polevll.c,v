@Declare __p1evll and __polevll protos in math_private.h instead of
redeclaring each time in ld{80,128}.  Pointed out by theo.

 *
 *	Evaluate polynomial
 *
 *
 *
 * SYNOPSIS:
 *
 * int N;
 * long double x, y, coef[N+1], polevl[];
 *
 * y = polevll( x, coef, N );
 *
 *
 *
 * DESCRIPTION:
 *
 * Evaluates polynomial of degree N:
 *
 *                     2          N
 * y  =  C  + C x + C x  +...+ C x
 *        0    1     2          N
 *
 * Coefficients are stored in reverse order:
 *
 * coef[0] = C  , ..., coef[N] = C  .
 *            N                   0
 *
 *  The function p1evll() assumes that coef[N] = 1.0 and is
 * omitted from the array.  Its calling arguments are
 * otherwise the same as polevll().
 *
 *
 * SPEED:
 *
 * In the interest of speed, there are no checks for out
 * of bounds arithmetic.  This routine is used by most of
 * the functions in the library.  Depending on available
 * equipment features, the user may wish to rewrite the
 * program in microcode or assembly language.

@Finalize work on the math library.  It's time to do this monster
commit, and deal with problems (if any) in tree.

Note that this adds the following functions.  Ports with hacks might
need adjustments.

nexttoward(3), fma(3), nexttowardf(3), fmaf(3), acoshl(3), asinhl(3),
atanhl(3), coshl(3), sinhl(3), tanhl(3), expl(3), expm1l(3), logl(3),
log10l(3), log1pl(3), log2l(3), modfl(3), cbrtl(3), hypotl(3),
powl(3), erfl(3), erfcl(3), lgammal(3), tgammal(3), ceill(3),
floorl(3), lrintl(3), llrintl(3), roundl(3), lroundl(3), llroundl(3),
truncl(3), fmodl(3), remainderl(3), remquol(3), nextafterl(3),
nexttowardl(3), fmal(3).

With this commit, our library implements all functionality required
by C99.  Documentation bits will follow.
