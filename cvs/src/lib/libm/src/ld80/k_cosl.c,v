 * Domain [-0.7854, 0.7854], range ~[-2.43e-23, 2.425e-23]:
 * |cos(x) - c(x)| < 2**-75.1
 *
 * The coefficients of c(x) were generated by a pari-gp script using
 * a Remez algorithm that searches for the best higher coefficients
 * after rounding leading coefficients to a specified precision.
 *
 * Simpler methods like Chebyshev or basic Remez barely suffice for
 * cos() in 64-bit precision, because we want the coefficient of x^2
 * to be precisely -0.5 so that multiplying by it is exact, and plain
 * rounding of the coefficients of a good polynomial approximation only
 * gives this up to about 64-bit precision.  Plain rounding also gives
 * a mediocre approximation for the coefficient of x^4, but a rounding
 * error of 0.5 ulps for this coefficient would only contribute ~0.01
 * ulps to the final error, so this is unimportant.  Rounding errors in
 * higher coefficients are even less important.
 *
 * In fact, coefficients above the x^4 one only need to have 53-bit
 * precision, and this is more efficient.  We get this optimization
 * almost for free from the complications needed to search for the best
 * higher coefficients.

log
@- 80-bit and quad precision trigonometric and other most
important functions: acosl, asinl, atanl, atan2l, cosl,
sinl, tanl, exp2l, frexpl, ilogbl, ldexpl, logbl, scalbnl,
fabsl, hypotl, powl, sqrtl, rintl, copysignl, nanl, fdiml,
fmaxl, fminl.  mostly taken from freebsd, needed alot of
changes to adapt.  note, these are all c versions;  and are
quite slow when architectures have, e.g. sqrt.  assembly
versions will be added afterwards
- make them .weak/__weak_alias to the double precision
versions on other archs
- no need to have two finites.  finite() and finitef() are
non-standard 3BSD obsolete versions of isfinite.  remove
from libm.  make them weak_alias in libc to __isfinite and
__isfinitef instead.  similarly make 3BSD obsolete versions
of isinf, isinff, isnan, isnanf weak_aliases to C99's
__isinf, __isinff, __isnan, __isnanf
- remove unused infinity.c.  the c library has infinities
for each supported platform
- use STRICT_ASSIGN cast hack for _kernel_rem_pio2, so that
the double version has a chance of working on i386 with
extra precision
- avoid storing multiple copies of the pi/2 array, since
it won't vary
- bump major due to removed finite/finitef.  although they
will be in libc, which anything is linked to, minor bump
might be enough
ok millert@@.   tested by sthen@@, jsg@@, ajacoutot@@, kili@@, naddy@@
