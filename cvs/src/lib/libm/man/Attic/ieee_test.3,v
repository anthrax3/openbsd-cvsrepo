.Sh NAME
.Nm logb ,
.Nm logbf ,
.Nm scalb ,
.Nm scalbf ,
.Nm significand ,

.Nd IEEE test functions
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <math.h>
.Ft double
.Fn logb "double x"
.Ft float
.Fn logbf "float x"
.Ft double
.Fn scalb "double x" "double n"
.Ft float
.Fn scalbf "float x" "float n"
.Ft double
.Fn significand "double x"
.Ft float
.Fn significandf "float x"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
These functions allow users to test conformance to
.St -ieee754 .
Their use is not otherwise recommended.
.Pp
.Fn logb x
returns
.Fa x Ns 's exponent
.Fa n ,
a signed integer converted to double\-precision floating\-point.
.Fn logb \*(Pm\*(If
= +\*(If;
.Fn logb 0
= -\*(If with a division by zero exception.
.Fn logbf
is the single precision form of
.Fn logb .
.Pp
.Fn scalb x n
returns
.Fa x Ns \(**(2** Ns Fa n )
computed by exponent manipulation.
.Fn scalbf
is the single precision form of
.Fn scalb .
.Pp
.Fn significand x
returns
.Fa sig ,
where
.Fa x
:=
.Fa sig No \(** 2** Ns Fa n
with 1 \(<=
.Fa sig
< 2.
.Fn significand x
is not defined when
.Fa x
is 0, \*(Pm\*(If, or \*(Na.
.Fn significandf
is the single precision for of
.Fn significand .

@- remove all trailing whitespace
     * except when it is escaped with a `\' at the end of the line
- fix remaining .Nm usage as well
- this is from a patch I received from kwesterback@@home.com, who has been
  working on some scripts for fixing formatting errors in mdoc'd man pages

Ok, so there could be a cost/benefit debate with this commit, but since I have
the patch we might as well commit it...

@The proper order of the ``introductory'' macros in a man page is .Dd/.Dt/.Os.
Out of the approximately 1450 man pages, only about 90 of them were wrong.
Thanks to kwesterback@@home.com for coming up with a script and patch to repair
this. The patch also inserted a .Os macro in the few man pages that were
missing one.
