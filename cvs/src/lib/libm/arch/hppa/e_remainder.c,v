1.6
log
@Switch libc and libm to use strong aliases rather than weak aliases
where appropriate.  Among other things makes the symbols consistent
across all architectures (notably where ldbl mantissa is 53 bits).

While at it, kill unused LINTLIBRARY/PROTOLIB1 cruft which was there
to trick lint into recording the right prototypes for aliased
functions.  Most of the work done at the awesome n2k13 hackathon.

Agreed by kettenis@@, guenther@@, matthew@@.

@rcsid[] and sccsid[] and copyright[] are essentially unmaintained (and
unmaintainable).  these days, people use source.  these id's do not provide
any benefit, and do hurt the small install media
(the 33,000 line diff is essentially mechanical)

@- replace dtoa w/ David's gdtoa, version 2008-03-15
- provide proper dtoa locks
- use the real strtof implementation
- add strtold, __hdtoa, __hldtoa
- add %a/%A support
- don't lose precision in printf, don't round to double anymore
- implement extended-precision versions of libc functions: fpclassify,
isnan, isinf, signbit, isnormal, isfinite, now that the ieee.h is
fixed
- separate vax versions of strtof, and __hdtoa
- add complex math support.  added functions: cacos, casin, catan,
ccos, csin, ctan, cacosh, casinh, catanh, ccosh, csinh, ctanh, cexp,
clog, cabs, cpow, csqrt, carg, cimag, conj, cproj, creal, cacosf,
casinf, catanf, ccosf, csinf, ctanf, cacoshf, casinhf, catanhf,
ccoshf, csinhf, ctanhf, cexpf, clogf, cabsf, cpowf, csqrtf, cargf,
cimagf, conjf, cprojf, crealf
- add fdim, fmax, fmin
- add log2. (adapted implementation e_log.c.  could be more acruate
& faster, but it's good enough for now)
- remove wrappers & cruft in libm, supposed to work-around mistakes
in SVID, etc.;  use ieee versions.  fixes issues in python 2.6 for
djm@@
- make _digittoint static
- proper definitions for i386, and amd64 in ieee.h
- sh, powerpc don't really have extended-precision
- add missing definitions for mips64 (quad), m{6,8}k (96-bit) float.h
for LDBL_*
- merge lead to frac for m{6,8}k, for gdtoa to work properly
- add FRAC*BITS & EXT_TO_ARRAY32 definitions in ieee.h, for hdtoa&ldtoa
to use
- add EXT_IMPLICIT_NBIT definition, which indicates implicit
normalization bit
- add regression tests for libc: fpclassify and printf
- arith.h & gd_qnan.h definitions
- update ieee.h: hppa doesn't have quad-precision, hppa64 does
- add missing prototypes to gdtoaimp
- on 64-bit platforms make sure gdtoa doesn't use a long when it
really wants an int
- etc., what i may have forgotten...
- bump libm major, due to removed&changed symbols
- no libc bump, since this is riding on djm's libc major crank from
a day ago
