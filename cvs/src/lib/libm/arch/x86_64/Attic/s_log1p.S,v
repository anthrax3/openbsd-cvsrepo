/*
 * The log1p() function is provided to compute an accurate value of
 * log(1 + x), even for tiny values of x. The i387 FPU provides the
 * fyl2xp1 instruction for this purpose. However, the range of this
 * instruction is limited to:
 * 		-(1 - (sqrt(2) / 2)) <= x <= sqrt(2) - 1
 *                         -0.292893 <= x <= 0.414214
 * at least on older processor versions.
 *
 * log1p() is implemented by testing the range of the argument.
 * If it is appropriate for fyl2xp1, this instruction is used.
 * Else, we compute log1p(x) = ln(2)*ld(1 + x) the traditional way
 * (using fyl2x).
 *
 * The range testing costs speed, but as the rationale for the very
 * existence of this function is accuracy, we accept that.
 *
 * In order to reduce the cost for testing the range, we check if
 * the argument is in the range
 *                             -0.25 <= x <= 0.25
 * which can be done with just one conditional branch. If x is
 * inside this range, we use fyl2xp1. Outside of this range,
 * the use of fyl2x is accurate enough.

@add libm parts for amd64;  much from netbsd, integration by mickey.
Instead of mixing the i387 & xmm register components, we decide to
explicitly seperate them.  libm is already confusing enough as it is,
thank you very much
