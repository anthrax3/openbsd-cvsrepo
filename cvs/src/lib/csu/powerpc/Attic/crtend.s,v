@update for binutils 2.9.1, whenever it might show up... The changes
are cleanup that would not work correctly with the newer version. works
fine with the current (old) version of gas/ld.

ALSO:
Found a very long outstanding bug on the powerpc port. whenever
nroff was run, say during a build, it would complain about memory being
freed twice. Found the cause of this was that *roff which is written in
C++ was using globals that had constructors/destructors and due to a
bug in the crt code, the destructors were getting called when a program
exited via falling out of the main loop. calling exit directly would
not exersize the bug that ran the destructors twice. THIS BUG IS NOW FIXED.

@Check-in of powerpc csu support.
NOTE: This will not work until the other pieces are checked in.
This is primarily the NetBSD powerpc port, with modifications
to support ELF.

A change needs to be made to one of the bsd.*.mk files to support
DESTDIR compilation with the crtbegin and crtend files.
