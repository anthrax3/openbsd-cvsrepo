@Rearrange C runtime bits: now that ld.so exports environ and __progname,
move their definitions and initialization in static links to libc.a
Make crt0 always invoke a new func _csu_finish() in libc to process the auxv
and to either register the ld.so cleanup function (in dynamic links) or
initialize environ and __progname and do MC_DISABLE_KBIND (in static links).
In libc, get pagesize from auxv; cache that between getpagesize() and
sysconf(_SC_PAGESIZE)
