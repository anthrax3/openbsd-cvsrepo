.Dt RFC1413 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm rfc1413
.Nd libwrap client side ident implementation
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <tcpd.h>
.Ft int
.Fn rfc1413 "struct sockaddr *rmt_sin" "struct sockaddr *our_sin" "char *dest" "size_t dsize" "int ident_timeout_time"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn rfc1413
retrieves a user name from a remote system using the
.Nm ident
protocol described in RFC 1413.
It is implemented in the
.Nm libwrap.a
library.
.Pp
.Fn rfc1413
takes two sockaddr pointers as parameters:
.Nm rmt_sin
for the remote host end of a connected TCP socket, and
.Nm our_sin
for the local end.
.Nm dest
should be allocated by the caller to store the found username,
and must be of length at least
.Nm dsize .
.Nm ident_timeout_time
is a timeout in seconds on the entire ident query, used to ensure
that you don't wait forever for a slow or unresponsive remote host
to answer the ident query.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
When username lookup is successful,
.Fn rfc1413
strips the trailing CRLF from the returned value and stores up to
.Nm "dsize - 1"
bytes of the returned username into
.Nm dest ,
always terminating with a NUL byte.
In this case 0 is returned.
.Fn rfc1413
returns -1 if any failure occurs such that it was unable to
retrieve the remote username.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr hosts_access 3
.Sh BUGS
The ident protocol only works on TCP sockets.
.Pp
Ident connections are made unencrypted, and nothing prevents the
remote server from lying about who the user is.
Consequently, ident should never be used to authenticate users.
ident is however, quite useful for logging users of connections
from multiuser machines that can be trusted not to lie about it.
