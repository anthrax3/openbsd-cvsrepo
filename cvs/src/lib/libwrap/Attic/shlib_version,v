@Switch time_t, ino_t, clock_t, and struct kevent's ident and data
members to 64bit types.  Assign new syscall numbers for (almost
all) the syscalls that involve the affected types, including anything
with time_t, timeval, itimerval, timespec, rusage, dirent, stat,
or kevent arguments.  Add a d_off member to struct dirent and replace
getdirentries() with getdents(), thus immensely simplifying and
accelerating telldir/seekdir.  Build perl with -DBIG_TIME.

Bump the major on every single base library: the compat bits included
here are only good enough to make the transition; the T32 compat
option will be burned as soon as we've reached the new world are
are happy with the snapshots for all architectures.

DANGER: ABI incompatibility.  Updating to this kernel requires extra
work or you won't be able to login: install a snapshot instead.

@Crank all library major numbers.  Needed due to the fact that we
now build libraries with propolice enabled.  Without this, existing
binaries (such as ports/packages) that link with any system library
other than libc will fail with an undefined symbol of "___guard"
(__guard on ELF).
