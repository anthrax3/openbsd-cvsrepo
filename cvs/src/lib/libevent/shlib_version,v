1.9
log
@Switch time_t, ino_t, clock_t, and struct kevent's ident and data
members to 64bit types.  Assign new syscall numbers for (almost
all) the syscalls that involve the affected types, including anything
with time_t, timeval, itimerval, timespec, rusage, dirent, stat,
or kevent arguments.  Add a d_off member to struct dirent and replace
getdirentries() with getdents(), thus immensely simplifying and
accelerating telldir/seekdir.  Build perl with -DBIG_TIME.

Bump the major on every single base library: the compat bits included
here are only good enough to make the transition; the T32 compat
option will be burned as soon as we've reached the new world are
are happy with the snapshots for all architectures.

DANGER: ABI incompatibility.  Updating to this kernel requires extra
work or you won't be able to login: install a snapshot instead.

log
@Update libevent to 1.4.13.

This is the core library only, the DNS parts are removed and it does not
include the other extra bits (HTTP, DNS, and RPC), a separate port for
these will appear in due course.

Thanks to jsg, sthen, alek, gilles, jacekm, bernd and any others I've
forgotten for testing/comments.

Note that /usr/include/evdns.h should be removed after updating.

@- limit the amount of data bufferevents are going to consume to something
  reasonable; in some circumstances it could happen that libevent happily
  allocated 100MB in read buffers without telling the user; found by
