@Update libevent to 1.4.13.

This is the core library only, the DNS parts are removed and it does not
include the other extra bits (HTTP, DNS, and RPC), a separate port for
these will appear in due course.

Thanks to jsg, sthen, alek, gilles, jacekm, bernd and any others I've
forgotten for testing/comments.

Note that /usr/include/evdns.h should be removed after updating.
