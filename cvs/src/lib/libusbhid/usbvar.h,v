log
@Keep libusbhid's HID parser in sync with the kernel one.  This is mostly
a backport from FreeBSD's r205728, r224511 and 225839 without the new
functions to set/get a report ID nor the usbhidctl(1) & usbhidaction(1)
bits.

Committing now to open the "Monday's Bump Parade".

@Update usb userland stuff to reflect hid changes in the kernel.
This adds the new program usbhidaction which can be used to assign actions
to events that occur on a uhid device.  For example, you can now make the
volume buttons on some newer keyboards actually do something.
