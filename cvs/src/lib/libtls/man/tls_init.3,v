.Dt TLS_INIT 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm tls_init ,
.Nm tls_config_new ,
.Nm tls_config_free ,
.Nm tls_config_error
.Nd initialize TLS client and server API
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In tls.h
.Ft int
.Fn tls_init void
.Ft struct tls_config *
.Fn tls_config_new void
.Ft void
.Fn tls_config_free "struct tls_config *config"
.Ft const char *
.Fn tls_config_error "struct tls_config *config"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm tls
family of functions establishes a secure communications channel
using the TLS socket protocol.
Both clients and servers are supported.
.Pp
The
.Fn tls_init
function initializes global data structures.
It should be called once before any other functions.
It may be called more than once, but not concurrently.
.Pp
Before a connection is created, a configuration must be created.
The
.Fn tls_config_new
function allocates, initializes, and returns a new default configuration
object that can be used for future connections.
Several functions exist to change the options of the configuration; see
.Xr tls_config_set_protocols 3 ,
.Xr tls_load_file 3 ,
.Xr tls_config_ocsp_require_stapling 3 ,
and
.Xr tls_config_verify 3 .
.Pp
The
.Fn tls_config_error
function may be used to retrieve a string containing more information
about the most recent error relating to a configuration.
.Pp
A TLS connection object is created by
.Xr tls_client 3
or
.Xr tls_server 3
and configured with
.Xr tls_configure 3 .
.Pp
A client connection is initiated after configuration by calling
.Xr tls_connect 3 .
A server can accept a new client connection by calling
.Xr tls_accept_socket 3
on an already established socket connection.
.Pp
Two functions are provided for input and output,
.Xr tls_read 3
and
.Xr tls_write 3 .
Both automatically perform the
.Xr tls_handshake 3
when needed.
.Pp
The properties of established TLS connections
can be inspected with the functions described in
.Xr tls_conn_version 3
and
.Xr tls_ocsp_process_response 3 .
.Pp
After use, a TLS connection should be closed with
.Xr tls_close 3
and then freed by calling
.Xr tls_free 3 .
.Pp
When no more contexts are to be configured,
the configuration object should be freed by calling
.Fn tls_config_free .
It is safe to call
.Fn tls_config_free
as soon as the final call to
.Fn tls_configure
has been made.
If
.Fa config
is
.Dv NULL ,
no action occurs.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn tls_init
returns 0 on success or -1 on error.
.Pp
.Fn tls_config_new
returns
.Dv NULL
on error or an out of memory condition.
.Pp
.Fn tls_config_error
returns
.Dv NULL
if no error occurred with
.Fa config
at all, or if memory allocation failed while trying to assemble the
string describing the most recent error related to
.Fa config .
.Sh SEE ALSO

.Xr tls_client 3 ,

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm tls
API first appeared in
.Ox 5.6
as a response to the unnecessary challenges other APIs present in
order to use them safely.
.Pp
All functions were renamed from
.Fn ressl_*
to
.Fn tls_*
for
.Ox 5.7 .
.Pp
.Fn tls_config_error
appeared in
.Ox 6.0 .

.Pp
Many others contributed to various parts of the library; see the
individual manual pages for more information.
.Sh CAVEATS
The function
.Fn tls_config_error
returns an internal pointer.
It must not be freed by the application, or a double free error
will occur.
The pointer will become invalid when the next error occurs with
.Fa config .
Consequently, if the application may need the message at a later
time, it has to copy the string before calling the next
.Sy libtls
function involving
.Fa config ,
or a segmentation fault or read access to unintended data is the
likely result.
