@Add the Cammelia cipher to libcrypto.

There used to be a strong reluctance to provide this cipher in LibreSSL in the
past, because the licence terms under which Cammelia was released by NTT were
free-but-not-in-the-corners, by restricting the right to modify the source
code, as well retaining the right to enforce their patents against anyone
in the future.

However, as stated in http://www.ntt.co.jp/news/news06e/0604/060413a.html ,
NTT changed its mind and made this code truly free. We only wish there had
been more visibility of this, for we could have had enabled Cammelia
earlier (-:

Licence change noticed by deraadt@@. General agreement from the usual LibreSSL
suspects.

Crank libcrypto.so minor version due to the added symbols.

log
@Enable assembler code for AES, BN (Montgomery), GCM128, SHA1, SHA256 and SHA512.
Note that GCM128 Neon code is currently not built (and thus not tested), as
the current toolchain does not support Neon instructions.
