1.1
log
@GOST crypto algorithms (well, most of them), ported from the removed GOST
engine to regular EVP citizens, contributed by Dmitry Eremin-Solenikov;
libcrypto bits only for now.

This is a verbatim import of Dmitry's work, and does not compile in this
state; the forthcoming commits will address these issues.

None of the GOST code is enabled in libcrypto yet, for it still gets
compiled with OPENSSL_NO_GOST defined. However, the public header gost.h
will be installed.
