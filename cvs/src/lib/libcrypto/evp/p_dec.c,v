@Send the function codes from the error functions to the bit bucket,
as was done earlier in libssl. Thanks inoguchi@@ for noticing
libssl had more reacharounds into this.

@Only import cryptlib.h in the four source files that actually need it.
Remove the openssl public includes from cryptlib.h and add a small number
of includes into the source files that actually need them. While here,
also sort/group/tidy the includes.

@Explicitly include <openssl/opensslconf.h> in every file that references
an OPENSSL_NO_* define. This avoids relying on something else pulling it
in for us, plus it fixes several cases where the #ifndef OPENSSL_NO_XYZ is
never going to do anything, since OPENSSL_NO_XYZ will never defined, due
to the fact that opensslconf.h has not been included.

This also includes some miscellaneous sorting/tidying of headers.

1.1.1.1
log
@Import of SSLeay-0.9.0b with RSA and IDEA stubbed + OpenBSD build
functionality for shared libs.

Note that routines such as sslv2_init and friends that use RSA will
not work due to lack of RSA in this library.

Needs documentation and help from ports for easy upgrade to full
functionality where legally possible.
