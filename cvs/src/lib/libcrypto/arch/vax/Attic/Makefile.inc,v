@Add the Cammelia cipher to libcrypto.

There used to be a strong reluctance to provide this cipher in LibreSSL in the
past, because the licence terms under which Cammelia was released by NTT were
free-but-not-in-the-corners, by restricting the right to modify the source
code, as well retaining the right to enforce their patents against anyone
in the future.

However, as stated in http://www.ntt.co.jp/news/news06e/0604/060413a.html ,
NTT changed its mind and made this code truly free. We only wish there had
been more visibility of this, for we could have had enabled Cammelia
earlier (-:

Licence change noticed by deraadt@@. General agreement from the usual LibreSSL
suspects.

Crank libcrypto.so minor version due to the added symbols.
