@Change the counter argument for CRYPTO_chacha_20 to be 64-bits on all platforms.

The recently-added EVP_aead_chacha20_poly1305_ietf() function, which implements
informational RFC 7539, "ChaCha20 and Poly1305 for IETF Protocols", needs a
64-bit counter to avoid truncation on 32-bit platforms.

The existing TLS ChaCha20-Poly1305 ciphersuite is not impacted by this, but
making this change requires an ABI bump.

log
@If a chacha operation does not consume all of the generated key stream,
ensure that we save it and consume it on subsequent writes. Otherwise we
end up discarding part of the key stream and instead generate a new block
at the start of the next write.

This was only an issue for callers that did multiple writes that are not
multiples of 64 bytes - in particular, the ChaCha20Poly1305 usage does not
hit this problem since it performs encryption in a single-shot. For the
same reason, this is also a non-issue when openssl(1) is used to encrypt
with ChaCha.

Issue identified by insane coder; reported to bugs@@ by Joseph M. Schwartz.
