@Send the function codes from the error functions to the bit bucket,
as was done earlier in libssl. Thanks inoguchi@@ for noticing
libssl had more reacharounds into this.

log
@Check ECDH output buffer length and avoid truncation.

Currently, if you call ECDH_compute_key() it will silently truncate the
resulting key if the output buffer is less than the key size. Instead,
detect this condition and return an error. If the buffer provided is larger
than the key length, zero the remainder.

@Explicitly include <openssl/opensslconf.h> in every file that references
an OPENSSL_NO_* define. This avoids relying on something else pulling it
in for us, plus it fixes several cases where the #ifndef OPENSSL_NO_XYZ is
never going to do anything, since OPENSSL_NO_XYZ will never defined, due
to the fact that opensslconf.h has not been included.

This also includes some miscellaneous sorting/tidying of headers.
