@openssl.cnf tweaks following recent changes to usr.bin/openssl:

- don't define default_bits, allowing the compiled-in default (now 2048
bits) to take priority.

- add commented-out default_md line in case somebody needs an easy way
to change this.

- remove some sample sections which aren't really useful in the default
file (/etc/examples is the place for a more descriptive config, this
file should be barebones).

Help/OK jsing@@. OKs on earlier diff (openssl.cnf only) from phessler@@ aja@@.

@Move build machinery for libcrypto from libssl/crypto to libcrypto, as well
as configuration files; split manpages and .pc files between libcrypto and
libssl.
No functional change, only there to make engineering easier, and libcrypto
sources are still found in libssl/src/crypto at the moment.

ok reyk@@, also discussed with deraadt@@ beck@@ and the usual crypto suspects.
