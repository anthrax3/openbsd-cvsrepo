.Sh DESCRIPTION
The BN library performs arithmetic operations on integers of arbitrary
size.
It was written for use in public key cryptography, such as RSA and
Diffie-Hellman.
.Pp
It uses dynamic memory allocation for storing its data structures.
That means that there is no limit on the size of the numbers manipulated
by these functions, but return values must always be checked in case a
memory allocation error has occurred.
.Pp
The basic object in this library is a
.Vt BIGNUM .
It is used to hold a single large integer.
This type should be considered opaque and fields should not be modified
or accessed directly.
.Pp
.Fn BN_new
allocates and initializes a
.Vt BIGNUM
structure.
.Pp
.Fn BN_init
initializes an existing uninitialized
.Vt BIGNUM .
It is deprecated and dangerous: see
.Sx CAVEATS .
.Pp
.Fn BN_clear
is used to destroy sensitive data such as keys when they are no longer
needed.
It erases the memory used by
.Fa a
and sets it to the value 0.
.Pp
.Fn BN_free
frees the components of the
.Vt BIGNUM
and, if it was created by
.Fn BN_new ,
also the structure itself.
.Fn BN_clear_free
additionally overwrites the data before the memory is returned to the
system.
If
.Fa a
is a
.Dv NULL
pointer, no action occurs.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn BN_new
returns a pointer to the
.Vt BIGNUM .
If the allocation fails, it returns
.Dv NULL
and sets an error code that can be obtained by
.Xr ERR_get_error 3 .

.Sh HISTORY
.Fn BN_new ,
.Fn BN_clear ,
.Fn BN_free ,
and
.Fn BN_clear_free
are available in all versions of SSLeay and OpenSSL.
.Fn BN_init
was added in SSLeay 0.9.1b.
.Sh CAVEATS
.Fn BN_init
must not be called on a
.Vt BIGNUM
that was used and contains an actual number, or the memory
used for storing the number is leaked immediately.
Besides, it must not be called on a number allocated with
.Fn BN_new ,
or the
.Vt BIGNUM
structure itself will likely be leaked later on.
It can only be used on static
.Vt BIGNUM
structures, on
.Vt BIGNUM
structures on the stack, or on
.Vt BIGNUM
structures
.Xr malloc 3 Ap ed
manually, but all of these options are discouraged because they
will no longer work once the
.Vt BIGNUM
data type is made opaque.

@Seriously warn against calling BN_init(3), BN_MONT_CTX_init(3),
and BN_RECP_CTX_init(3).  They are not only deprecated but so
dangerous that they are almost unusable.  I found these scary
traps while reading the code in order to document BN_set_flags(3).
While here, delete ERR_get_error(3) from SEE ALSO.

@Merge bn(3) into BN_new(3).

OpenSSL removed bn(3) without replacement, but the introductory
text does seem helpful, and it is good for a sub-library to have a
central page pointing to all other pages and pointed at from all
other pages of the sub-library.
