.Sh DESCRIPTION
The buffer library handles simple character arrays.
Buffers are used for various purposes in the library, most notably
memory BIOs.
.Pp
The library uses the
.Vt BUF_MEM
structure defined in buffer.h:
.Bd -literal
typedef struct buf_mem_st
{
	size_t length;	/* current number of bytes */
	char *data;
	size_t max;	/* size of buffer */
} BUF_MEM;
.Ed
.Pp
.Fa length
is the current size of the buffer in bytes;
.Fa max
is the amount of memory allocated to the buffer.
There are three functions which handle these and one miscellaneous function.
.Pp
.Fn BUF_MEM_new
allocates a new buffer of zero size.
.Pp
.Fn BUF_MEM_free
frees up an already existing buffer.
The data is zeroed before freeing up in case the buffer contains
sensitive data.
If
.Fa a
is a
.Dv NULL
pointer, no action occurs.
.Pp
.Fn BUF_MEM_grow
changes the size of an already existing buffer to
.Fa len .
Any data already in the buffer is preserved if it increases in size.
.Pp
.Fn BUF_MEM_grow_clean
is similar to
.Fn BUF_MEM_grow ,
but it sets any freed or additionally allocated memory to zero.
.Pp
.Fn BUF_reverse
reverses
.Fa len
bytes at
.Fa in
into
.Fa out .
If
.Fa in
is
.Dv NULL ,
.Fa out
is reversed in place.
.Pp
.Fn BUF_strdup
copies a NUL terminated string into a block of allocated memory and
returns a pointer to the allocated block.
Unlike the system
.Xr strdup 3
function,
.Fn BUF_strdup
will accept a
.Dv NULL
argument and will return
.Dv NULL
in that case.
Its use in new programs is discouraged.
.Pp
The memory allocated from
.Fn BUF_strdup
should be freed up using the
.Xr free 3
function.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn BUF_MEM_new
returns the buffer or
.Dv NULL
on error.
.Pp
.Fn BUF_MEM_grow
and
.Fn BUF_MEM_grow_clean
return zero on error or the new size (i.e.\&
.Fa len ) .
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr BIO_new 3
.Sh HISTORY
.Fn BUF_MEM_new ,
.Fn BUF_MEM_free
and
.Fn BUF_MEM_grow
are available in all versions of SSLeay and OpenSSL.
.Fn BUF_strdup
was added in SSLeay 0.8.

@Remove sentences in RETURN VALUES sections saying that functions with
void return types 'return no value'. This is obvious and therefore
unneccessary to mention.

We spare rewind(3)'s sentence because espie@@ pointed out that it's a
warning - the function masks a potential error.

This commit also adds a sentence to X509_free clarifying that it's
NULL-safe. This bit was discussed with doug@@.
