.Sh DESCRIPTION
If a client asks about the validity of a certificate and it turns
out to be invalid, the responder may optionally communicate which
certificate revocation list the certificate was found on.
The required data is stored as an ASN.1
.Vt CrlID
structure in the singleExtensions field of the
.Vt SingleResponse
structure.
The
.Vt CrlID
is represented by an
.Vt OCSP_CRLID
object, which will be stored inside the
.Vt OCSP_SINGLERESP
object documented in
.Xr OCSP_SINGLERESP_new 3 .
.Pp
.Fn OCSP_CRLID_new
allocates and initializes an empty
.Vt OCSP_CRLID
object.
.Fn OCSP_CRLID_free
frees
.Fa crlid .
.Pp
.Fn OCSP_crlID_new
accepts the
.Fa url
at which the CRL is available, the CRL
.Fa number ,
and/or the
.Fa time
at which the CRL was created.
Each argument can be
.Dv NULL ,
in which case the respective field is omitted.
The resulting
.Vt CrlID
structure is encoded in ASN.1 using
.Xr X509V3_EXT_i2d 3
with criticality 0.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn OCSP_CRLID_new
returns a new
.Vt OCSP_CRLID
object or
.Dv NULL
if an error occurred.
.Pp
.Fn OCSP_crlID_new
returns a new
.Vt X509_EXTENSION
object or
.Dv NULL
if an error occurred.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr OCSP_resp_find_status 3 ,
.Xr OCSP_response_status 3 ,
.Xr X509_EXTENSION_new 3
.Sh STANDARDS
RFC 6960: X.509 Internet Public Key Infrastructure Online Certificate
Status Protocol, section 4.4.2: CRL References
.Sh CAVEATS
The function names
.Fn OCSP_CRLID_new
and
.Fn OCSP_crlID_new
only differ in case.

@Write OCSP_CRLID_new(3) and OCSP_SERVICELOC_new(3) from scratch.
These two and OCSP_CRLID_free(3) and OCSP_SERVICELOC_free(3) are
public by being in OpenSSL doc/man3/X509_dup.pod.
OCSP_crlID_new(3) and OCSP_url_svcloc_new(3) are related and,
even though completely undocumented in OpenSSL, obviously much
more important.

If you had told me a year ago that i would ever write such text,
i would have called you crazy.
