@Document ERR_load_BN_strings(3).
jsing@@ confirmed that this function is public and worth documenting.

This page needs much more work, it is outrageously incomplete and
unclear.  For example, it remains unexplained what error strings
are, what "registering" means and what the benefit for the application
is, what happens if it is not done, or what happens if an error
occurs after calling ERR_free_strings(3).  I tried to read the code,
but it is so contorted that i postponed that work.  For example,
it looks like there are hooks for applications to replace the
functions used for registering strings by other, application-supplied
functions, and, of course, there are many levels of macro and
function wrappers.

For now, i only documented the most obvious BUGS.

.Sh NAME
.Nm ERR_load_crypto_strings ,
.Nm ERR_free_strings ,
.Nm ERR_load_BN_strings ,
.Nm SSL_load_error_strings
.Nd load and free OpenSSL error strings
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In openssl/err.h
.Ft void
.Fn ERR_load_crypto_strings void
.Ft void
.Fn ERR_free_strings void
.In openssl/bn.h
.Ft void
.Fn ERR_load_BN_strings void
.In openssl/ssl.h
.Ft void
.Fn SSL_load_error_strings void
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn ERR_load_crypto_strings
registers the error strings for all
.Xr crypto 3
functions.
.Fn SSL_load_error_strings
does the same, but also registers the
.Xr ssl 3
error strings.
.Pp
.Fn ERR_load_BN_strings
only registers the error strings for the
.Vt BIGNUM
part of the library, i.e. the functions documented in
.Xr BN_new 3
and in the manual pages referenced from there.
That may be useful if no other parts of the crypto library
are used by the program.
Similar functions exist for other parts of the crypto library,
but they are not yet documented.
.Pp
If the error strings were already loaded before, no action occurs.
.Pp
One of these functions should be called before generating textual error
messages.
However, this is not required when memory usage is an issue.
.Pp
.Fn ERR_free_strings
frees all previously loaded error strings.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr ERR 3 ,
.Xr ERR_error_string 3
.Sh HISTORY
.Fn ERR_load_crypto_strings ,
.Fn SSL_load_error_strings ,
and
.Fn ERR_free_strings
are available in all versions of SSLeay and OpenSSL.
.Sh BUGS
Even though the error strings are already compiled into the object
code of the library as static strings, these functions store them
again using dynamically allocated memory on the heap.
That may fail if insufficient memory is available,
but these functions do not report such errors.
Instead, they fail silently, possibly having registered none or only
a part of the strings requested.
