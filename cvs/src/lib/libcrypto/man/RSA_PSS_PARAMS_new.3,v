.Sh NAME
.Nm RSA_PSS_PARAMS_new ,
.Nm RSA_PSS_PARAMS_free
.Nd probabilistic signature scheme with RSA hashing
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In openssl/rsa.h
.Ft RSA_PSS_PARAMS *
.Fn RSA_PSS_PARAMS_new void
.Ft void
.Fn RSA_PSS_PARAMS_free "RSA_PSS_PARAMS *params"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn RSA_PSS_PARAMS_new
allocates and initializes an empty
.Vt RSA_PSS_PARAMS
object, representing an ASN.1
.Vt RSASSA-PSS-params
structure defined in RFC 8017 appendix A.2.3.
It references the hash function and the mask generation function
and stores the length of the salt and the trailer field number.
.Fn RSA_PSS_PARAMS_free
frees
.Fa params .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn RSA_PSS_PARAMS_new
returns the new
.Vt RSA_PSS_PARAMS
object or
.Dv NULL
if an error occurs.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr RSA_padding_add_PKCS1_type_1 3 ,
.Xr X509_sign 3
.Sh STANDARDS
RFC 8017: PKCS#1: RSA Cryptography Specifications Version 2.2

1.1
log
@Start RSA_PSS_PARAMS_new(3) stub from scratch.  Both functions
are listed in <openssl/rsa.h> and OpenSSL doc/man3/X509_dup.pod.
Note that the OpenSSL documentation specifies the wrong header file.
More could probably be said about PSS, but this is a start...
