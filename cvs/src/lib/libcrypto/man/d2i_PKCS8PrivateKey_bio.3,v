.Sh DESCRIPTION
The PKCS#8 functions encode and decode private keys in PKCS#8 format
using both PKCS#5 v1.5 and PKCS#5 v2.0 password based encryption
algorithms.
.Pp
Other than the use of DER as opposed to PEM these functions are
identical to the corresponding functions described in
.Xr PEM_read_PrivateKey 3 .
.Pp
Before using these functions,
.Xr OpenSSL_add_all_algorithms 3
should be called to initialize the internal algorithm lookup tables.
Otherwise errors about unknown algorithms will occur if an attempt is
made to decrypt a private key.
.Pp
These functions are currently the only way to store encrypted private
keys using DER format.
.Pp
Currently all the functions use
.Vt BIO
or
.Vt FILE
pointers.
There are no functions which work directly on memory,
though this can be readily worked around
by converting the buffers to memory BIOs;
see
.Xr BIO_s_mem 3
for details.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr d2i_X509_SIG 3 ,
.Xr PEM_write_PKCS8PrivateKey 3 ,
.Xr PKCS8_PRIV_KEY_INFO_new 3
.Sh CAVEATS
Do not confuse these functions with
.Xr i2d_PKCS8PrivateKeyInfo_bio 3
and
.Xr i2d_PKCS8PrivateKeyInfo_fp 3 ,
which write out private keys in
.Sy unencrypted
DER format.
