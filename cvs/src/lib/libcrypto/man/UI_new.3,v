.Sh DESCRIPTION
UI stands for User Interface, and is a general purpose set of routines
to prompt the user for text-based information.
Through user-written methods (see
.Xr UI_create_method 3 ) ,
prompting can be done in any way imaginable, be it plain text prompting,
through dialog boxes or from a cell phone.
.Pp
All the functions work through a context of the type
.Vt UI .
This context contains all the information needed to prompt correctly
as well as a reference to a
.Vt UI_METHOD ,
which is an ordered vector of functions that carry out the actual
prompting.
.Pp
The first thing to do is to create a
.Vt UI
with
.Fn UI_new
or
.Fn UI_new_method ,
then add information to it with the
.Fn UI_add_*
or
.Fn UI_dup_*
functions.
Also, user-defined random data can be passed down to the underlying
method through calls to
.Fn UI_add_user_data .
The default UI method doesn't care about these data, but other methods
might.
Finally, use
.Fn UI_process
to actually perform the prompting and
.Fn UI_get0_result
to find the result to the prompt.
.Pp
A
.Vt UI
can contain more than one prompt, which are performed in the given
sequence.
Each prompt gets an index number which is returned by the
.Fn UI_add_*
and
.Fn UI_dup_*
functions, and has to be used to get the corresponding result with
.Fn UI_get0_result .
.Pp
The functions are as follows:
.Pp
.Fn UI_new
creates a new
.Vt UI
using the default UI method.
When done with this UI, it should be freed using
.Fn UI_free .
.Pp
.Fn UI_new_method
creates a new
.Vt UI
using the given UI method.
When done with this UI, it should be freed using
.Fn UI_free .
.Pp
.Fn UI_OpenSSL
returns the built-in UI method (note: not the default one, since
the default can be changed.
See further on).
This method is the most machine/OS dependent part of OpenSSL and
normally generates the most problems when porting.
.Pp
.Fn UI_free
removes
.Fa ui
from memory, along with all other pieces of memory that are connected
to it, like duplicated input strings, results and others.
If
.Fa ui
is a
.Dv NULL
pointer, no action occurs.
.Pp
.Fn UI_add_input_string
and
.Fn UI_add_verify_string
add a prompt to
.Fa ui ,
as well as flags and a result buffer and the desired minimum and
maximum sizes of the result, not counting the final NUL character.
The given information is used to prompt for information, for example
a password, and to verify a password (i.e. having the user enter
it twice and check that the same string was entered twice).
.Fn UI_add_verify_string
takes an extra argument that should be a pointer to the result buffer
of the input string that it's supposed to verify, or verification will
fail.
.Pp
.Fn UI_add_input_boolean
adds a prompt to
.Fa ui
that's supposed to be answered in a boolean way, with a single
character for yes and a different character for no.
A set of characters that can be used to cancel the prompt is given as
well.
The prompt itself is really divided in two, one part being the
descriptive text (given through the
.Fa prompt
argument) and one describing the possible answers (given through the
.Fa action_desc
argument).
.Pp
.Fn UI_add_info_string
and
.Fn UI_add_error_string
add strings that are shown at the same time as the prompt for extra
information or to show an error string.
The difference between the two is only conceptual.
With the builtin method, there's no technical difference between them.
Other methods may make a difference between them, however.
.Pp
The flags currently supported are
.Dv UI_INPUT_FLAG_ECHO ,
which is relevant for
.Fn UI_add_input_string
and will have the users response be echoed (when prompting for a
password, this flag should obviously not be used), and
.Dv UI_INPUT_FLAG_DEFAULT_PWD ,
which means that a default password of some sort will be used
(completely depending on the application and the UI method).
.Pp
.Fn UI_dup_input_string ,
.Fn UI_dup_verify_string ,
.Fn UI_dup_input_boolean ,
.Fn UI_dup_info_string ,
and
.Fn UI_dup_error_string
are basically the same as their
.Fn UI_add_*
counterparts, except that they make their own copies of all strings.
.Pp
.Fn UI_construct_prompt
is a helper function that can be used to create a prompt from two pieces
of information: a description and a name.
The default constructor (if there is none provided by the method used)
creates a string "Enter
.Em description
for
.Em name Ns :".
With the description "pass phrase" and the file name "foo.key", that
becomes "Enter pass phrase for foo.key:". Other methods may create
whatever string and may include encodings that will be processed by the
other method functions.
.Pp
.Fn UI_add_user_data
adds a piece of memory for the method to use at any time.
The builtin UI method doesn't care about this info.
Note that several calls to this function doesn't add data -
the previous blob is replaced with the one given as argument.
.Pp
.Fn UI_get0_user_data
retrieves the data that has last been given to the
.Fa ui
with
.Fn UI_add_user_data .
.Pp
.Fn UI_get0_result
returns a pointer to the result buffer associated with the information
indexed by
.Fa i .
.Pp
.Fn UI_process
goes through the information given so far, does all the printing and
prompting and returns the final status, which is -2 on out-of-band
events (Interrupt, Cancel, ...), -1 on error, or 0 on success.
.Pp
.Fn UI_ctrl
adds extra control for the application author.
For now, it understands two commands:
.Dv UI_CTRL_PRINT_ERRORS ,
which makes
.Fn UI_process
print the OpenSSL error stack as part of processing the
.Fa ui ,
and
.Dv UI_CTRL_IS_REDOABLE ,
which returns a flag saying if the used
.Fa ui
can be used again or not.
.Pp
.Fn UI_set_default_method
changes the default UI method to the one given.
.Pp
.Fn UI_get_default_method
returns a pointer to the current default UI method.
.Pp
.Fn UI_get_method
returns the UI method associated with a given
.Fa ui .
.Pp
.Fn UI_set_method
changes the UI method associated with a given
.Fa ui .

1.5
log
@Remove bogus cross reference to ui_create(3) reported by jmc@@
and refer readers to the header file instead.

I'm not convinced customized prompting is such a bright idea, it
feels somewhat like overengineering, so i'm not documenting it right
now.  People who really feel compelled to roll their own prompting
can go read the source code.
