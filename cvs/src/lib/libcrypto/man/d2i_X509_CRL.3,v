.Sh DESCRIPTION
These functions decode and encode X.509 certificate revocation lists.
For details about the semantics, examples, caveats, and bugs, see
.Xr ASN1_item_d2i 3 .
.Pp
.Fn d2i_X509_CRL
and
.Fn i2d_X509_CRL
decode and encode an ASN.1
.Vt CertificateList
structure defined in RFC 5280 section 5.1.
.Fn d2i_X509_CRL_bio ,
.Fn d2i_X509_CRL_fp ,
.Fn i2d_X509_CRL_bio ,
and
.Fn i2d_X509_CRL_fp
are similar except that they decode or encode using a
.Vt BIO
or
.Vt FILE
pointer.
.Pp
.Fn d2i_X509_CRL_INFO
and
.Fn i2d_X509_CRL_INFO
decode and encode an ASN.1
.Vt TBSCertList
structure defined in RFC 5280 section 5.1.
.Pp
.Fn d2i_X509_REVOKED
and
.Fn i2d_X509_REVOKED
decode and encode an ASN.1 structure representing one element of
the revokedCertificates field of the ASN.1
.Vt TBSCertList
structure.
