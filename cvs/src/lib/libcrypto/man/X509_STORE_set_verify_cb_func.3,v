@Add Copyright and license; jmc@@ noticed that i missed this file.

I'm not merging documentation for X509_STORE_set_verify_func(3)
from OpenSSL because their documentations does not appear to match
the code we have, and i don't understand what the code does.

.Ft void

.Fa "int (*verify_cb)(int ok, X509_STORE_CTX *ctx)"
.Fc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn X509_STORE_set_verify_cb
sets the verification callback of
.Sy ctx
to
.Sy verify_cb ,
overwriting any existing callback.
.Pp
.Fn X509_STORE_set_verify_cb_func
also sets the verification callback but it is implemented as a macro.
.Pp
The verification callback from an
.Vt X509_STORE
is inherited by the corresponding
.Vt X509_STORE_CTX
structure when it is initialized.
This can be used to set the verification callback when the
.Vt X509_STORE_CTX
is otherwise inaccessible (for example during S/MIME verification).
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn X509_STORE_set_verify_cb
and
.Fn X509_STORE_set_verify_cb_func
do not return a value.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr X509_STORE_CTX_set_verify_cb 3
.Sh HISTORY
.Fn X509_STORE_set_verify_cb_func
is available in all versions of SSLeay and OpenSSL.
.Pp
.Fn X509_STORE_set_verify_cb
was added to OpenSSL 1.0.0.
.Sh BUGS
The macro version of this function was the only one available before
OpenSSL 1.0.0.
