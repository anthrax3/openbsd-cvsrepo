.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn X509_ALGOR_new
allocates and initializes an empty
.Vt X509_ALGOR
object, representing an ASN.1
.Vt AlgorithmIdentifier
structure defined in RFC 5280 section 4.1.1.2.
Such objects can specify a cryptographic algorithm together
with algorithm-specific parameters.
They are used by many other objects, for example certificates,
certificate revocation lists, and certificate requests.
.Pp
.Fn X509_ALGOR_free
frees
.Fa alg .
.Pp
.Fn X509_ALGOR_dup
copies
.Fa alg
by calling
.Xr i2d_X509_ALGOR 3
and
.Xr d2i_X509_ALGOR 3 .
.Pp
.Fn X509_ALGOR_set0
sets the algorithm OID of
.Fa alg
to
.Fa aobj
and the associated parameter type to
.Fa ptype
with value
.Fa pval .
If
.Fa ptype
is
.Dv V_ASN1_UNDEF
the parameter is omitted, otherwise
.Fa ptype
and
.Fa pval
have the same meaning as the
.Fa type
and
.Fa value
parameters to
.Xr ASN1_TYPE_set 3 .
All the supplied parameters are used internally so must
.Sy NOT
be freed after this call.
.Pp
.Fn X509_ALGOR_get0
is the inverse of
.Fn X509_ALGOR_set0 :
it returns the algorithm OID in
.Pf * Fa paobj
and the associated parameter in
.Pf * Fa pptype
and
.Pf * Fa ppval
from
.Fa alg .
.Pp
.Fn X509_ALGOR_set_md
sets
.Fa alg
to appropriate values for the message digest
.Fa md .
.Pp
.Fn X509_ALGOR_cmp
compares
.Fa a
and
.Fa b .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn X509_ALGOR_new
and
.Fn X509_ALGOR_dup
return a new
.Vt X509_ALGOR
object or
.Dv NULL
if an error occurs.
.Pp
.Fn X509_ALGOR_set0
returns 1 for success or 0 for failure.
.Pp
.Fn X509_ALGOR_cmp
returns 0 if
.Fa a
and
.Fa b
have identical encodings or non-zero otherwise.
