@Describe what ASN1_OBJECT_new(3), ASN1_OBJECT_free(3), OBJ_dup(3),
and OBJ_create(3) really do rather than making broad and incomplete
statements that are only true in some cases.

Improve the one-line descriptions.
Some minor wording improvements while here.

There is obviously more work to do in the vicinity...

.Ft ASN1_OBJECT *
.Fo ASN1_OBJECT_new
.Fa void
.Fc
.Ft void
.Fo ASN1_OBJECT_free
.Fa "ASN1_OBJECT *a"
.Fc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn ASN1_OBJECT_new
allocates and initializes an empty
.Vt ASN1_OBJECT
object, representing an ASN.1 OBJECT IDENTIFIER.
It can hold a short name, a long name, a numeric identifier (NID),
and a sequence of integers identifying a node in the International
Object Identifier tree as specified in ITU-T recommendation X.660.
The new object is marked as dynamically allocated.
.Pp
Application programs normally use utility functions like
.Xr OBJ_nid2obj 3
rather than using
.Fn ASN1_OBJECT_new
directly.
.Pp
.Fn ASN1_OBJECT_free
has the following effects:
.Pp
All data contained in
.Fa a
that is marked as dynamically allocated is freed,
and the respective fields of
.Fa a
become empty.
Contained data not marked as dynamically allocated remains intact.
.Pp
If the object
.Fa a
itself is marked as dynamically allocated, it is freed.
Otherwise, the pointer
.Fa a
remains valid.
.Pp
If
.Fa a
is a
.Dv NULL
pointer or if neither the object itself nor any of its content
is marked as dynamically allocated, no action occurs.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
If the allocation fails,
.Fn ASN1_OBJECT_new
returns
.Dv NULL
and sets an error code that can be obtained by
.Xr ERR_get_error 3 .
Otherwise it returns a pointer to the new object.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr d2i_ASN1_OBJECT 3 ,
.Xr OBJ_nid2obj 3
.Sh HISTORY
.Fn ASN1_OBJECT_new
and
.Fn ASN1_OBJECT_free
are available in all versions of SSLeay and OpenSSL.

@Remove sentences in RETURN VALUES sections saying that functions with
void return types 'return no value'. This is obvious and therefore
unneccessary to mention.

We spare rewind(3)'s sentence because espie@@ pointed out that it's a
warning - the function masks a potential error.

This commit also adds a sentence to X509_free clarifying that it's
NULL-safe. This bit was discussed with doug@@.
