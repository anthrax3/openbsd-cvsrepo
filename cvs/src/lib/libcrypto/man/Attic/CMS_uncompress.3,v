.Fa cms .
.Fa data

is an optional set of flags.
.Pp
The
.Fa dcont
parameter is used in the rare case where the compressed content is
detached.
It will normally be set to
.Dv NULL .
.Sh NOTES
The only currently supported compression algorithm is zlib: if the
structure indicates the use of any other algorithm, an error is returned.
.Pp
If zlib support is not compiled into OpenSSL, then
.Fn CMS_uncompress
will always return an error.
.Pp
The following flags can be passed in the
.Fa flags
parameter:
.Pp
If the
.Dv CMS_TEXT
flag is set, MIME headers for type
.Sy text/plain
are deleted from the content.
If the content is not of type
.Sy text/plain ,
then an error is returned.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn CMS_uncompress
returns either 1 for success or 0 for failure.
The error can be obtained from
.Xr ERR_get_error 3 .
.Sh SEE ALSO

.Xr ERR_get_error 3
.Sh HISTORY

memory as mentioned in
.Xr CMS_verify 3
also applies to
.Xr CMS_decompress 3 .
