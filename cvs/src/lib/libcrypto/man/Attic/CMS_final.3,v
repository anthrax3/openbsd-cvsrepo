.Dt CMS_FINAL 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm CMS_final
.Nd finalise a CMS_ContentInfo structure
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In openssl/cms.h
.Ft int
.Fo CMS_final
.Fa "CMS_ContentInfo *cms"
.Fa "BIO *data"
.Fa "BIO *dcont"
.Fa "unsigned int flags"
.Fc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn CMS_final
finalises the structure
.Fa cms .
Its purpose is to perform any operations necessary on
.Fa cms
(digest computation for example) and set the appropriate fields.
The parameter
.Fa data
contains the content to be processed.
The
.Fa dcont
parameter contains a
.Vt BIO
to write content to after processing: this is
only used with detached data and will usually be set to
.Dv NULL .
.Sh NOTES
This function will normally be called when the
.Dv CMS_PARTIAL
flag is used.
It should only be used when streaming is not performed because the
streaming I/O functions perform finalisation operations internally.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn CMS_final
returns 1 for success or 0 for failure.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr CMS_encrypt 3 ,
.Xr CMS_sign 3 ,
.Xr ERR_get_error 3
.Sh HISTORY
.Fn CMS_final
was added to OpenSSL 0.9.8.
