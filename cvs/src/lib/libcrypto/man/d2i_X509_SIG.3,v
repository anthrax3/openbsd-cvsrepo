@Full rewrite.

Also document d2i_PKCS8_bio(3), i2d_PKCS8_bio(3), d2i_PKCS8_fp(3),
and i2d_PKCS8_fp(3) while here, listed in <openssl/x509.h>
and in OpenSSL doc/man3/d2i_X509.pod.

No, these functions have nothing to do with the many other d2i_PKCS8*(3)
functions all around, and nothing with PKCS#8 at all in the first place.

Read the BUGS section.  I couldn't make this stuff up.

.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn d2i_X509_SIG
and
.Fn i2d_X509_SIG
decode and encode an ASN.1
.Vt DigestInfo
structure defined in RFC 2315 section 9.4
and equivalently in RFC 8017 section 9.2.
For details about the semantics, examples, caveats, and bugs, see
.Xr ASN1_item_d2i 3 .
.Pp
.Fn d2i_PKCS8_bio
and
.Fn d2i_PKCS8_fp
are similar to
.Fn d2i_X509_SIG
except that they read from a
.Vt BIO
or
.Vt FILE
pointer.
.Pp
.Fn i2d_PKCS8_bio
and
.Fn i2d_PKCS8_fp
are similar to
.Fn i2d_X509_SIG
except that they write to a
.Vt BIO
or
.Vt FILE
pointer.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn d2i_X509_SIG ,
.Fn d2i_PKCS8_bio ,
and
.Fn d2i_PKCS8_fp
return a
.Vt X509_SIG
object or
.Dv NULL
if an error occurs.
.Pp
.Fn i2d_X509_SIG
returns the number of bytes successfully encoded or a negative value
if an error occurs.
.Pp
.Fn i2d_PKCS8_bio
and
.Fn i2d_PKCS8_fp
return 1 for success or 0 if an error occurs.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr ASN1_item_d2i 3 ,
.Xr PKCS7_new 3 ,
.Xr RSA_sign 3 ,
.Xr X509_SIG_new 3
.Sh STANDARDS
RFC 2315: PKCS #7: Cryptographic Message Syntax,
section 9: Signed-data content type
.Pp
RFC 8017: PKCS #1: RSA Cryptography Specifications,
section 9: Encoding Methods for Signatures
.Sh BUGS
.Fn d2i_PKCS8_bio ,
.Fn i2d_PKCS8_bio ,
.Fn d2i_PKCS8_fp ,
and
.Fn i2d_PKCS8_fp
are severely misnamed and should have been called
.Dq d2i_X509_SIG_bio
and so on.
.Pp
Or arguably, the
.Vt X509_SIG
object is misnamed itself, considering that it represents
.Vt DigestInfo
from PKCS#7 and PKCS#1.
Then again, calling it
.Dq PKCS8
instead clearly isn't an improvement.
.Pp
Either way, these names just don't fit.

@Consistently mark up various ASN.1 type names defined in standards
related to X.509 with .Vt such that they can be searched for.
