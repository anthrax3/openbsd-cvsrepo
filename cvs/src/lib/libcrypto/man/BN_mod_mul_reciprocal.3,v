.Fc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn BN_mod_mul_reciprocal
can be used to perform an efficient
.Xr BN_mod_mul 3
operation when the operation will be performed repeatedly with the same
modulus.
It computes
.Fa r Ns =( Ns Fa a Ns * Ns Fa b Ns )% Ns Fa m
using
.Fa recp Ns =1/ Ns Fa m ,
which is set as described below.
.Fa ctx
is a previously allocated
.Vt BN_CTX
used for temporary variables.
.Pp
.Fn BN_RECP_CTX_new
allocates and initializes a
.Vt BN_RECP_CTX
structure.
.Pp
.Fn BN_RECP_CTX_init
initializes an existing uninitialized
.Vt BN_RECP_CTX .
It is deprecated and dangerous: see
.Sx CAVEATS .
.Pp
.Fn BN_RECP_CTX_free
frees the components of the
.Vt BN_RECP_CTX ,
and, if it was created by
.Fn BN_RECP_CTX_new ,
also the structure itself.
If
.Fa recp
is a
.Dv NULL
pointer, no action occurs.
.Pp
.Fn BN_RECP_CTX_set
stores
.Fa m
in
.Fa recp
and sets it up for computing
.Pf 1/ Fa m
and shifting it left by
.Fn BN_num_bits m Ns +1
to make it an integer.
The result and the number of bits it was shifted left will later be
stored in
.Fa recp .
.Pp
.Fn BN_div_recp
divides
.Fa a
by
.Fa m
using
.Fa recp .
It places the quotient in
.Fa dv
and the remainder in
.Fa rem .
.Pp
The
.Vt BN_RECP_CTX
structure is defined as follows:
.Bd -literal
typedef struct bn_recp_ctx_st {
	BIGNUM N;	/* the divisor */
	BIGNUM Nr;	/* the reciprocal */
	int num_bits;
	int shift;
	int flags;
} BN_RECP_CTX;
.Ed
.Pp
It cannot be shared between threads.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn BN_RECP_CTX_new
returns the newly allocated
.Vt BN_RECP_CTX
or
.Dv NULL
on error.
.Pp
For the other functions, 1 is returned for success or 0 on error.
The error codes can be obtained by
.Xr ERR_get_error 3 .
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr BN_add 3 ,
.Xr BN_CTX_new 3 ,
.Xr BN_new 3
.Sh HISTORY
.Vt BN_RECP_CTX
was added in SSLeay 0.9.0.
Before that, a function
.Fn BN_reciprocal
was used instead, and the
.Fn BN_mod_mul_reciprocal
arguments were different.
.Sh CAVEATS
.Fn BN_RECP_CTX_init
must not be called on a context that was used previously, or
memory used by the embedded
.Vt BIGNUM
structures is leaked immediately.
Besides, it must not be called on a context created with
.Fn BN_RECP_CTX_new ,
or the context itself will likely be leaked later.
It can only be used on a static
.Vt BN_RECP_CTX
structure, on one located on the stack, or on one
.Xr malloc 3 Ap ed
manually, but all these options are discouraged because they
will no longer work once
.Vt BN_RECP_CTX
is made opaque.

log
@Seriously warn against calling BN_init(3), BN_MONT_CTX_init(3),
and BN_RECP_CTX_init(3).  They are not only deprecated but so
dangerous that they are almost unusable.  I found these scary
traps while reading the code in order to document BN_set_flags(3).
While here, delete ERR_get_error(3) from SEE ALSO.
