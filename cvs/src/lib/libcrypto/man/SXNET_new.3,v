.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn SXNET_new
allocates and initializes an empty
.Vt SXNET
object representing a non-standard proprietary Thawte strong extranet
X.509 extension.
.Fn SXNET_free
frees
.Fa sxnet .
.Pp
.Fn SXNETID_new
allocates and initializes an empty
.Vt SXNETID
object.
It is used inside
.Vt SXNET .
.Fn SXNETID_free
frees
.Fa sxnetid .
.Pp
The remaining functions decode and encode these objects
using DER format.
For details about the semantics, examples, caveats, and bugs, see
.Xr ASN1_item_d2i 3 .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn SXNET_new
and
.Fn d2i_SXNET
return an
.Vt SXNET
object or
.Dv NULL
if an error occurs.
.Pp
.Fn SXNETID_new
and
.Fn d2i_SXNETID
return an
.Vt SXNETID
object or
.Dv NULL
if an error occurs.
.Pp
.Fn i2d_SXNET
and
.Fn i2d_SXNETID
return the number of bytes successfully encoded or a negative value
if an error occurs.

.Sh BUGS
This manual page does not explain what the extension actually does
because no authoritative information was found online so far.
.Pp
The only hint was found in an ancient white paper "Securing IBM
Applications with Public Key Infrastructure" on the IBM website,
dated June 13, 2001: "Thawte also has a technology called Strong
Extranet that allows institutions to encode customer information
in the extensions to their customer's certificates.
Because multiple institutions can add information, the user needs
only one certificate, making renewal and revocation simpler, although
the issue of modifying an extension to an existing certificate is
not addressed."
.Pp
It is unclear whether that explanation is accurate, but in any case,
it is not very specific.

1.1
log
@Write new SXNET_new(3) manual page from scratch.  All four functions
are listed in <openssl/x509v3.h> and in OpenSSL doc/man3/X509_dup.pod.
OpenSSL documentation specifies the wrong header file.

I consider the quotation from
http://www-03.ibm.com/security/library/wp_pki0730.shtml
fair use because
(1) it is a very brief extract from a long text,
(2) no other source of information is available,
(3) it is quoted for the purpose of education and research,
(4) republishing happens in a not-for-profit context.

I'm not including the URI into the manual page because large corporate
websites are notorious for changing URIs during each spring cleaning.
