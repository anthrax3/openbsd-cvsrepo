.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn EVP_PKEY_CTX_new
function allocates a public key algorithm context using the algorithm
specified in
.Fa pkey
and the
.Vt ENGINE
.Fa e .
.Pp
The
.Fn EVP_PKEY_CTX_new_id
function allocates a public key algorithm context using the algorithm
specified by
.Fa id
and
.Vt ENGINE
.Fa e .
It is normally used when no
.Vt EVP_PKEY
structure is associated with the operations, for example during
parameter generation of key generation for some algorithms.
.Pp
.Fn EVP_PKEY_CTX_dup
duplicates the context
.Fa ctx .
.Pp
.Fn EVP_PKEY_CTX_free
frees up the context
.Fa ctx .
If
.Fa ctx
is a
.Dv NULL
pointer, no action occurs.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn EVP_PKEY_CTX_new ,
.Fn EVP_PKEY_CTX_new_id ,
and
.Fn EVP_PKEY_CTX_dup
return either the newly allocated
.Vt EVP_PKEY_CTX
structure or
.Dv NULL
if an error occurred.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr EVP_PKEY_new 3 ,
.Xr X25519 3
.Sh HISTORY
These functions were first added to OpenSSL 1.0.0.
.Sh CAVEATS
The
.Vt EVP_PKEY_CTX
structure is an opaque public key algorithm context used by the OpenSSL
high level public key API.
Contexts
.Sy MUST NOT
be shared between threads.
It is not permissible to use the same context simultaneously in two
threads.

log
@Add Copyright and license.
Mention that EVP_PKEY_CTX_free(3) accepts NULL.
Delete the useless statement that a void functions returns no value.
