.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn RSA_sign_ASN1_OCTET_STRING
signs the octet string
.Fa m
of size
.Fa m_len
using the private key
.Fa rsa
represented in DER using PKCS #1 padding.
It stores the signature in
.Fa sigret
and the signature size in
.Fa siglen .
.Fa sigret
must point to
.Fn RSA_size rsa
bytes of memory.
.Pp
.Fa dummy
is ignored.
.Pp
.Fn RSA_verify_ASN1_OCTET_STRING
verifies that the signature
.Fa sigbuf
of size
.Fa siglen
is the DER representation of a given octet string
.Fa m
of size
.Fa m_len .
.Fa dummy
is ignored.
.Fa rsa
is the signer's public key.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn RSA_sign_ASN1_OCTET_STRING
returns 1 on success or 0 otherwise.
.Fn RSA_verify_ASN1_OCTET_STRING
returns 1 on successful verification or 0 otherwise.
.Pp
The error codes can be obtained by
.Xr ERR_get_error 3 .
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr ERR_get_error 3 ,
.Xr RSA_new 3 ,
.Xr RSA_sign 3 ,
.Xr RSA_verify 3
.Sh HISTORY
.Fn RSA_sign_ASN1_OCTET_STRING
and
.Fn RSA_verify_ASN1_OCTET_STRING
were added in SSLeay 0.8.
.Sh BUGS
These functions serve no recognizable purpose.
