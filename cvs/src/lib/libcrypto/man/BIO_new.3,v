.Sh DESCRIPTION
A
.Vt BIO
is an I/O abstraction object, hiding many of the underlying I/O
details from an application.
If an application uses BIOs for its I/O, it can transparently handle
SSL connections, unencrypted network connections, and file I/O.
.Pp
The
.Fn BIO_new
function constructs a new
.Vt BIO
using the method
.Fa type .
There are two groups of BIO types, source/sink BIOs and filter BIOs.
.Pp
Source/sink BIOs provide input or consume output.
Examples include socket BIOs and file BIOs.
.Pp
Filter BIOs take data from one BIO and pass it through to another,
or to the application, forming a chain of BIOs.
The data may be left unmodified (for example by a message digest BIO)
or translated (for example by an encryption BIO).
The effect of a filter BIO may change according to the I/O operation
it is performing: for example an encryption BIO will encrypt data
if it is written to and decrypt data if it is read from.
.Pp
Some BIOs (such as memory BIOs) can be used immediately after calling
.Fn BIO_new .
Others (such as file BIOs) need some additional initialization, and
utility functions exists to construct and initialize such BIOs.
.Pp
Normally the
.Fa type
argument is supplied by a function which returns a pointer to a
.Vt BIO_METHOD .
There is a naming convention for such functions:
the methods for source/sink BIOs are called
.Fn BIO_s_*
and those for filter BIOs
.Fn BIO_f_* .
.Pp
.Fn BIO_set
sets the method of an already existing BIO.
.Pp
.Fn BIO_free
and
.Fn BIO_vfree
destruct a single BIO, which may also have some effect on the
underlying I/O structure, for example it may close the file being
referred to under certain circumstances.
If
.Fa a
is a
.Dv NULL
pointer, no action occurs.
If
.Fn BIO_free
is called on a BIO chain, it will only destruct one BIO,
resulting in a memory leak.
.Pp
.Fn BIO_free_all
destructs an entire BIO chain.
It does not halt if an error occurs
destructing an individual BIO in the chain.
If
.Fa a
is a
.Dv NULL
pointer, no action occurs.
Calling
.Fn BIO_free_all
on a single BIO has the same effect as
.Fn BIO_vfree .
.Pp
Common I/O functions are documented in
.Xr BIO_read 3 .
Forming chains is explained in
.Xr BIO_push 3 ;
inspecting them is explained in
.Xr BIO_find_type 3 .
For more details about the different kinds of BIOs, see the individual
.Vt BIO_METHOD
manual pages.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn BIO_new
returns a newly constructed
.Vt BIO
object or
.Dv NULL
on failure.
.Pp
.Fn BIO_set
and
.Fn BIO_free
return 1 for success or 0 for failure.
.Sh EXAMPLES
Create a memory BIO:
.Pp
.Dl BIO *mem = BIO_new(BIO_s_mem());

@We don't want section 3 manual pages with names that do not correspond
to functions, so delete the BIO(3) manual page and merge its content
into BIO_new(3) and BIO_push(3).

Sort the content of BIO_new(3) into a logical order
and improve the wording in various ways.
Add the required cross references to BIO_push(3).
