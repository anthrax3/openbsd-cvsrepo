.Sh DESCRIPTION
These functions decode and encode PKCS#10 certification requests.
For details about the semantics, examples, caveats, and bugs, see
.Xr ASN1_item_d2i 3 .
.Pp
.Fn d2i_X509_REQ
and
.Fn i2d_X509_REQ
decode and encode an ASN.1
.Vt CertificationRequest
structure defined in RFC 2986 section 4.2.
.Fn d2i_X509_REQ_bio ,
.Fn d2i_X509_REQ_fp ,
.Fn i2d_X509_REQ_bio ,
and
.Fn i2d_X509_REQ_fp
are similar except that they decode or encode using a
.Vt BIO
or
.Vt FILE
pointer.
.Pp
.Fn d2i_X509_REQ_INFO
and
.Fn i2d_X509_REQ_INFO
decode and encode an ASN.1
.Vt CertificationRequestInfo
structure defined in RFC 2986 section 4.1.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn d2i_X509_REQ ,
.Fn d2i_X509_REQ_bio ,
and
.Fn d2i_X509_REQ_fp
return an
.Vt X509_REQ
object or
.Dv NULL
if an error occurs.
.Pp
.Fn d2i_X509_REQ_INFO
returns an
.Vt X509_REQ_INFO
object or
.Dv NULL
if an error occurs.
.Pp
.Fn i2d_X509_REQ
and
.Fn i2d_X509_REQ_INFO
return the number of bytes successfully encoded or a negative value
if an error occurs.
.Pp
.Fn i2d_X509_REQ_bio
and
.Fn i2d_X509_REQ_fp
return 1 for success or 0 if an error occurs.
