@Delete a cross reference to the undocumented function X509_check_purpose(3)
that wasn't accompanied by any related information.  Reported by jmc@@.

There are a dozen functions handling X509_PURPOSE objects, all
undocumented, a host of defines, and it seems that a callback is
required.  So this seems complicated, i doubt that is much used
in practice, and i'm not diving into it at this point in time.
