.Fn PKEY_USAGE_PERIOD_new void
.Ft void
.Fn PKEY_USAGE_PERIOD_free "PKEY_USAGE_PERIOD *period"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn PKEY_USAGE_PERIOD_new
allocates and initializes an empty
.Vt PKEY_USAGE_PERIOD
object, representing an ASN.1
.Vt PrivateKeyUsagePeriod
structure defined in RFC 3280 section 4.2.1.4.
It could be used in
.Vt X509
certificates to specify a validity period for the private key
that differed from the validity period of the certificate.
.Pp
.Fn PKEY_USAGE_PERIOD_free
frees
.Fa period .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn PKEY_USAGE_PERIOD_new
returns the new
.Vt PKEY_USAGE_PERIOD
object or
.Dv NULL
if an error occurs.

.Sh STANDARDS
RFC 3280: Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate and
Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile,
section 4.2.1.4: Private Key Usage Period
.Pp
RFC 3280 was obsoleted by RFC 5280, which says: "Section 4.2.1.4
in RFC 3280, which specified the
.Vt PrivateKeyUsagePeriod
certificate extension but deprecated its use, was removed.
Use of this ISO standard extension is neither deprecated
nor recommended for use in the Internet PKI."

log
@Write new PKEY_USAGE_PERIOD_new(3) manual page from scratch,
documenting the dubious RFC 3280 PrivateKeyUsagePeriod extension.
Both functions are listed in <openssl/x509v3.h>
and in OpenSSL doc/man3/X509_dup.pod.
OpenSSL documentation specifies the wrong header file.
