.Ft X509_NAME *
.Fn X509_NAME_new void
.Ft void
.Fn X509_NAME_free "X509_NAME *name"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
An X.501
.Vt Name
is an ordered sequence of relative distinguished names.
A relative distinguished name is a set of key-value pairs; see
.Xr X509_NAME_ENTRY_new 3
for details.
.Pp
Various X.509 structures contain X.501
.Vt Name
substructures.
They are for example used for the issuers of certificates and
certificate revocation lists and for the subjects of certificates
and certificate requests.
.Pp
.Fn X509_NAME_new
allocates and initializes an empty
.Vt X509_NAME
object, representing an ASN.1
.Vt Name
structure defined in RFC 5280 section 4.1.2.4.
Data can be added to such objects with the functions described in
.Xr X509_NAME_add_entry_by_txt 3 ,
and they can be inspected with the functions described in
.Xr X509_NAME_get_index_by_NID 3 .
.Pp
.Fn X509_NAME_free
frees
.Fa name
and all the
.Vt X509_NAME_ENTRY
objects contained in it.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn X509_NAME_new
returns a new
.Vt X509_NAME
object or
.Dv NULL
if an error occurred.
