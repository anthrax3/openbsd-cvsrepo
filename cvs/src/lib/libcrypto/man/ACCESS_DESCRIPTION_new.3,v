.In openssl/x509v3.h

.Fn AUTHORITY_INFO_ACCESS_free "AUTHORITY_INFO_ACCESS *aia"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Using the information access extensions, certificates and certificate
revocation lists can point to auxiliary information and services
available online, for example online validation services or CA
policy data.
.Pp
.Fn ACCESS_DESCRIPTION_new
allocates and initializes an empty
.Vt ACCESS_DESCRIPTION
object, representing an ASN.1
.Vt AccessDescription
structure defined in RFC 5280 section 4.2.2.1.
It can hold a pointer to a
.Vt GENERAL_NAME
object documented in
.Xr GENERAL_NAME_new 3
and an access method identifier.
.Fn ACCESS_DESCRIPTION_free
frees
.Fa ad .
.Pp
The access method identifier is somewhat misnamed; it identifies
the type and format of the information provided.
How to access that information is often obvious from the
.Vt GENERAL_NAME
which may for example include a uniform resource identifier.
.Pp
Four standard access method identifiers are defined in RFC 5280:
.Bl -bullet
.It
.Qq id-ad-caIssuers
can occur in the authority information access extension of certificates
and certificate revocation lists and provides access to certificates
issued to the CA that issued the certificate, or provides access
to certificates used for signing the CRL, in order to help constructing
a certification path.
.It
.Qq id-ad-ocsp
can occur in the authority information access extension of certificates
and provides access to revocation information via the Online
Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) defined in RFC 6960.
.It
.Qq id-ad-caRepository
can occur in the subject information access extension of CA
certificates and provides access to an online repository of
certificates issued by the CA.
.It
.Qq id-ad-timeStamping
can occur in the subject information access extension of end entity
certificates and indicates that the subject offers timestamping
services using the Time Stamp Protocol defined in RFC 3161.
.El
.Pp
.Fn AUTHORITY_INFO_ACCESS_new
allocates and initializes an empty
.Vt AUTHORITY_INFO_ACCESS
object, which is a
.Vt STACK_OF(ACCESS_DESCRIPTION)
and represents an ASN.1
.Vt AuthorityInfoAccessSyntax
structure defined in RFC 5280 section 4.2.2.1.
If can be used for the authority information access extension of
certificates and certificate revocation lists and for the subject
information access extension of certificates.
.Fn AUTHORITY_INFO_ACCESS_free
frees
.Fa aia .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn ACCESS_DESCRIPTION_new
and
.Fn AUTHORITY_INFO_ACCESS_new
return the new
.Vt ACCESS_DESCRIPTION
or
.Vt AUTHORITY_INFO_ACCESS
object, respectively, or
.Dv NULL
if an error occurs.

specified in the underlying X.509 standard.

Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Profile:
