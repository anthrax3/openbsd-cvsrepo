.Dt DSA_NEW 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm DSA_new ,
.Nm DSA_free
.Nd allocate and free DSA objects
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In openssl/dsa.h
.Ft DSA*
.Fn DSA_new void
.Ft void
.Fo DSA_free
.Fa "DSA *dsa"
.Fc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The DSA functions implement the Digital Signature Algorithm.
.Pp
.Fn DSA_new
allocates and initializes a
.Vt DSA
structure.
It is equivalent to calling
.Fn DSA_new_method NULL .
.Pp
.Fn DSA_free
frees the
.Vt DSA
structure and its components.
The values are erased before the memory is returned to the system.
If
.Fa dsa
is a
.Dv NULL
pointer, no action occurs.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
If the allocation fails,
.Fn DSA_new
returns
.Dv NULL
and sets an error code that can be obtained by
.Xr ERR_get_error 3 .
Otherwise it returns a pointer to the newly allocated structure.

.Sh STANDARDS
US Federal Information Processing Standard FIPS 186 (Digital Signature
Standard, DSS), ANSI X9.30
.Sh HISTORY
.Fn DSA_new
and
.Fn DSA_free
are available in all versions of SSLeay and OpenSSL.

log
@Merge one sentence and the references from dsa(3) to DSA_new(3) and
discard the rest of the text.  There is no value in documenting
some of the fields of a structure and then going on to say that the
structure is intended as opaque.  Besides, i doubt that we want
such strong marketing of ENGINE support.
