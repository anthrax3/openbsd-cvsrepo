.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn BN_cmp
compares the numbers
.Fa a
and
.Fa b .
.Fn BN_ucmp
compares their absolute values.
.Pp
.Fn BN_is_zero ,
.Fn BN_is_one
and
.Fn BN_is_word
test if
.Fa a
equals 0, 1, or
.Fa w
respectively.
.Fn BN_is_odd
tests if a is odd.
.Pp
.Fn BN_is_zero ,
.Fn BN_is_one ,
.Fn BN_is_word ,
and
.Fn BN_is_odd
are macros.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn BN_cmp
returns -1 if
.Fa a Ns < Ns Fa b ,
0 if
.Fa a Ns == Ns Fa b ,
and 1 if
.Fa a Ns > Ns Fa b .
.Fn BN_ucmp
is the same using the absolute values of
.Fa a
and
.Fa b .
