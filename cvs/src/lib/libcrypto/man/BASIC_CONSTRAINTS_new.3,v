.Sh NAME
.Nm BASIC_CONSTRAINTS_new ,
.Nm BASIC_CONSTRAINTS_free
.Nd X.509 extension to mark CA certificates
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In openssl/x509v3.h
.Ft BASIC_CONSTRAINTS *
.Fn BASIC_CONSTRAINTS_new void
.Ft void
.Fn BASIC_CONSTRAINTS_free "BASIC_CONSTRAINTS *bc"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn BASIC_CONSTRAINTS_new
allocates and initializes an empty
.Vt BASIC_CONSTRAINTS
object, representing an ASN.1
.Vt BasicConstraints
structure defined in RFC 5280 section 4.2.1.9.
.Pp
This object contains two fields.
The field
.Fa "int ca"
is non-zero if the certificate is a CA certificate.
The field
.Fa "ASN1_INTEGER *pathlen"
specifies the maximum number of non-self-issued intermediate
certificates that may follow this certificate in a valid
certification path.
.Pp
If an X.509 version 3 certificate does not contain this extension
or if the
.Fa ca
field of the
.Vt BASIC_CONSTRAINTS
object is 0, or if the certificate contains a key usage extension
having the
.Dv KU_KEY_CERT_SIGN
bit unset, then it is not a CA certificate but an end entity
certificate.
.Pp
.Fn BASIC_CONSTRAINTS_free
frees
.Fa bc .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn BASIC_CONSTRAINTS_new
returns the new
.Vt BASIC_CONSTRAINTS
object or
.Dv NULL
if an error occurs.

1.1
log
@Write new BASIC_CONSTRAINTS_new(3) manual from scratch, explaining
the important point of how to distinguish CA certificates from end
entity certificates.  Both functions are listed in <openssl/x509v3.h>
and in OpenSSL doc/man3/X509_dup.pod.
OpenSSL documentation specifies the wrong header file.
