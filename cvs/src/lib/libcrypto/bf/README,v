@This is a quick packaging up of my blowfish code into a library.
It has been lifted from SSLeay.
The copyright notices seem a little harsh because I have not spent the
time to rewrite the conditions from the normal SSLeay ones.

Basically if you just want to play with the library, not a problem.

1.1.1.1
log
@Import of SSLeay-0.9.0b with RSA and IDEA stubbed + OpenBSD build
functionality for shared libs.

Note that routines such as sslv2_init and friends that use RSA will
not work due to lack of RSA in this library.

Needs documentation and help from ports for easy upgrade to full
functionality where legally possible.
