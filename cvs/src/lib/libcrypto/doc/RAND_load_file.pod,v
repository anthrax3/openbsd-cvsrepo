=head1 NAME

RAND_load_file, RAND_write_file, RAND_file_name - PRNG seed file

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/rand.h>

 const char *RAND_file_name(char *buf, size_t num);

 int RAND_load_file(const char *filename, long max_bytes);

 int RAND_write_file(const char *filename);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

RAND_file_name() returns a default path for the random seed file.
B<buf> points to a buffer of size B<num> in which to store the
filename. If B<num> is too small for the path name, an error occurs.

RAND_load_file() used to allow for the state of the random number generator
to be controlled by external sources.

It is kept for ABI compatibility but is no longer functional, and
should not used in new programs.

RAND_write_file() writes a number of random bytes (currently 1024) to
file B<filename>.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

RAND_load_file() always returns 0.

RAND_write_file() returns the number of bytes written, and -1 if the
bytes written were generated without appropriate seed.

RAND_file_name() returns a pointer to B<buf> on success, and NULL on
error.

=head1 SEE ALSO

L<rand(3)|rand(3)>, L<RAND_add(3)|RAND_add(3)>,
L<RAND_cleanup(3)|RAND_cleanup(3)>

=head1 HISTORY

RAND_load_file(), RAND_write_file() and RAND_file_name() are available in
all versions of SSLeay and OpenSSL.

RAND_file_name() generates a default path for the random seed
file. B<buf> points to a buffer of size B<num> in which to store the
filename. The seed file is $RANDFILE if that environment variable is
set, $HOME/.rnd otherwise. If $HOME is not set either, or B<num> is
too small for the path name, an error occurs.

@Replace the old OpenSSL PRNG by direct use of arc4random_buf(), keeping the
existing RAND interfaces unchanged.

All interfaces allowing external feed or seed of the RNG (either from a file
or a local entropy gathering daemon) are kept for ABI compatibility, but are
no longer do anything.

While the OpenSSL PRNG was required 15+ years ago when many systems lacked
proper entropy collection, things have evolved and one can reasonably assume
it is better to use the kernel (system global) entropy pool rather than trying
to build one's own and having to compensate for thread scheduling...

<RANT>
Whoever thought that RAND_screen(), feeding the PRNG with the contents of the
local workstation's display, under Win32, was a smart idea, ought to be banned
from security programming.

if you are using the ssl26 packages for ssh and other things to work you will
need to get new ones (see ~beck/libsslsnap/<arch>) on cvs or ~beck/src-patent.tar.gz on cvs
