@Remove sentences in RETURN VALUES sections saying that functions with
void return types 'return no value'. This is obvious and therefore
unneccessary to mention.

We spare rewind(3)'s sentence because espie@@ pointed out that it's a
warning - the function masks a potential error.

This commit also adds a sentence to X509_free clarifying that it's
NULL-safe. This bit was discussed with doug@@.

=head1 NAME

X509_new, X509_free - X509 certificate ASN1 allocation functions

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/x509.h>

 X509 *X509_new(void);
 void X509_free(X509 *a);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The X509 ASN1 allocation routines, allocate and free an
X509 structure, which represents an X509 certificate.

X509_new() allocates and initializes a X509 structure.

X509_free() frees up the B<X509> structure B<a>.
If B<a> is a B<NULL> pointer, no action occurs.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

If the allocation fails, X509_new() returns B<NULL> and sets an error
code that can be obtained by L<ERR_get_error(3)|ERR_get_error(3)>.
Otherwise it returns a pointer to the newly allocated structure.

=head1 SEE ALSO

L<ERR_get_error(3)|ERR_get_error(3)>, L<d2i_X509(3)|d2i_X509(3)>

=head1 HISTORY

X509_new() and X509_free() are available in all versions of SSLeay and OpenSSL.
