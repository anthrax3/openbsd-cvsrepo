=head1 NAME

OPENSSL_VERSION_NUMBER, SSLeay, SSLeay_version - get OpenSSL version number

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/opensslv.h>
 #define OPENSSL_VERSION_NUMBER 0xnnnnnnnnnL

 #include <openssl/crypto.h>
 long SSLeay(void);
 const char *SSLeay_version(int t);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

OPENSSL_VERSION_NUMBER is a numeric release version identifier:

 MMNNFFPPS: major minor fix patch status

The status nibble has one of the values 0 for development, 1 to e for betas
1 to 14, and f for release.

for example

 0x000906000 == 0.9.6 dev
 0x000906023 == 0.9.6b beta 3
 0x00090605f == 0.9.6e release

Versions prior to 0.9.3 have identifiers E<lt> 0x0930.
Versions between 0.9.3 and 0.9.5 had a version identifier with this
interpretation:

 MMNNFFRBB major minor fix final beta/patch

for example

 0x000904100 == 0.9.4 release
 0x000905000 == 0.9.5 dev

Version 0.9.5a had an interim interpretation that is like the current one,
except the patch level got the highest bit set, to keep continuity.  The
number was therefore 0x0090581f.


For backward compatibility, SSLEAY_VERSION_NUMBER is also defined.

SSLeay() returns this number. The return value can be compared to the
macro to make sure that the correct version of the library has been
loaded, especially when using DLLs on Windows systems.

SSLeay_version() returns different strings depending on B<t>:

=over 4

=item SSLEAY_VERSION

The text variant of the version number and the release date.  For example,
"OpenSSL 0.9.5a 1 Apr 2000".

=item SSLEAY_CFLAGS

The compiler flags set for the compilation process in the form
"compiler: ..."  if available or "compiler: information not available"
otherwise.

=item SSLEAY_BUILT_ON

The date of the build process in the form "built on: ..." if available
or "built on: date not available" otherwise.

=item SSLEAY_PLATFORM

The "Configure" target of the library build in the form "platform: ..."
if available or "platform: information not available" otherwise.

=item SSLEAY_DIR

The "OPENSSLDIR" setting of the library build in the form "OPENSSLDIR: "...""
if available or "OPENSSLDIR: N/A" otherwise.

=back

For an unknown B<t>, the text "not available" is returned.

=head1 RETURN VALUE

The version number.

=head1 HISTORY

SSLeay() and SSLEAY_VERSION_NUMBER are available in all versions of SSLeay and
OpenSSL.  OPENSSL_VERSION_NUMBER is available in all versions of OpenSSL.
B<SSLEAY_DIR> was added in OpenSSL 0.9.7.
