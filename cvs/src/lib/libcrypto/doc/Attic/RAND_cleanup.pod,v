@Remove sentences in RETURN VALUES sections saying that functions with
void return types 'return no value'. This is obvious and therefore
unneccessary to mention.

We spare rewind(3)'s sentence because espie@@ pointed out that it's a
warning - the function masks a potential error.

This commit also adds a sentence to X509_free clarifying that it's
NULL-safe. This bit was discussed with doug@@.

ok martijn@@, sentiment supported by schwarze@@
