=head1 NAME

ERR_GET_LIB, ERR_GET_FUNC, ERR_GET_REASON - get library, function and
reason code

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/err.h>

 int ERR_GET_LIB(unsigned long e);

 int ERR_GET_FUNC(unsigned long e);

 int ERR_GET_REASON(unsigned long e);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The error code returned by ERR_get_error() consists of a library
number, function code and reason code. ERR_GET_LIB(), ERR_GET_FUNC()
and ERR_GET_REASON() can be used to extract these.

The library number and function code describe where the error
occurred, the reason code is the information about what went wrong.

Each sub-library of OpenSSL has a unique library number; function and
reason codes are unique within each sub-library.  Note that different
libraries may use the same value to signal different functions and
reasons.

B<ERR_R_...> reason codes such as B<ERR_R_MALLOC_FAILURE> are globally
unique. However, when checking for sub-library specific reason codes,
be sure to also compare the library number.

ERR_GET_LIB(), ERR_GET_FUNC() and ERR_GET_REASON() are macros.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

The library number, function code and reason code respectively.

=head1 SEE ALSO

L<err(3)|err(3)>, L<ERR_get_error(3)|ERR_get_error(3)>

=head1 HISTORY

ERR_GET_LIB(), ERR_GET_FUNC() and ERR_GET_REASON() are available in
all versions of SSLeay and OpenSSL.

@OpenSSL 0.9.5 merge

*warning* this bumps shared lib minors for libssl and libcrypto from 2.1 to 2.2
if you are using the ssl26 packages for ssh and other things to work you will
need to get new ones (see ~beck/libsslsnap/<arch>) on cvs or ~beck/src-patent.tar.gz on cvs
