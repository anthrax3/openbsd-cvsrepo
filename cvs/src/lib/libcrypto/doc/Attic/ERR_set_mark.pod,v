=head1 NAME

ERR_set_mark, ERR_pop_to_mark - set marks and pop errors until mark

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/err.h>

 int ERR_set_mark(void);

 int ERR_pop_to_mark(void);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

ERR_set_mark() sets a mark on the current topmost error record if there
is one.

ERR_pop_to_mark() will pop the top of the error stack until a mark is found.
The mark is then removed.  If there is no mark, the whole stack is removed.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

ERR_set_mark() returns 0 if the error stack is empty, otherwise 1.

ERR_pop_to_mark() returns 0 if there was no mark in the error stack, which
implies that the stack became empty, otherwise 1.

=head1 SEE ALSO

L<err(3)|err(3)>

=head1 HISTORY

ERR_set_mark() and ERR_pop_to_mark() were added in OpenSSL 0.9.8.
