=head1 NAME

RSA_blinding_on, RSA_blinding_off - protect the RSA operation from timing
attacks

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/rsa.h>

 int RSA_blinding_on(RSA *rsa, BN_CTX *ctx);

 void RSA_blinding_off(RSA *rsa);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

RSA is vulnerable to timing attacks. In a setup where attackers can
measure the time of RSA decryption or signature operations, blinding
must be used to protect the RSA operation from that attack.

RSA_blinding_on() turns blinding on for key B<rsa> and generates a
random blinding factor. B<ctx> is B<NULL> or a pre-allocated and
initialized B<BN_CTX>.

RSA_blinding_off() turns blinding off and frees the memory used for
the blinding factor.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

RSA_blinding_on() returns 1 on success, and 0 if an error occurred.

=head1 SEE ALSO

L<rsa(3)|rsa(3)>, L<rand(3)|rand(3)>

=head1 HISTORY

RSA_blinding_on() and RSA_blinding_off() appeared in SSLeay 0.9.0.

log
@Remove sentences in RETURN VALUES sections saying that functions with
void return types 'return no value'. This is obvious and therefore
unneccessary to mention.

We spare rewind(3)'s sentence because espie@@ pointed out that it's a
warning - the function masks a potential error.

This commit also adds a sentence to X509_free clarifying that it's
NULL-safe. This bit was discussed with doug@@.

@OpenSSL 0.9.5 merge

*warning* this bumps shared lib minors for libssl and libcrypto from 2.1 to 2.2
if you are using the ssl26 packages for ssh and other things to work you will
need to get new ones (see ~beck/libsslsnap/<arch>) on cvs or ~beck/src-patent.tar.gz on cvs
