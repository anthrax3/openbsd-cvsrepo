@Use arc4random_buf() instead of RAND_bytes() or RAND_pseudo_bytes().

arc4random_buf() is guaranteed to always succeed - it is worth noting
that a number of the replaced function calls were already missing return
value checks.

@In DES_random_key(), force the generated key to the odd parity before checking
it is not one of the weak and semi-weak keys.

Even though the probability of generating a weak key with incorrect parity is
abysmally small, there is no reason to be correct (although, if you're in a
need for fresh DES keys nowadays, you should seriously consider switching to
a stronger symmetric cipher algorithm).

*warning* this bumps shared lib minors for libssl and libcrypto from 2.1 to 2.2
if you are using the ssl26 packages for ssh and other things to work you will
need to get new ones (see ~beck/libsslsnap/<arch>) on cvs or ~beck/src-patent.tar.gz on cvs

1.1.1.1
log
@Import of SSLeay-0.9.0b with RSA and IDEA stubbed + OpenBSD build
functionality for shared libs.

Note that routines such as sslv2_init and friends that use RSA will
not work due to lack of RSA in this library.

Needs documentation and help from ports for easy upgrade to full
functionality where legally possible.
