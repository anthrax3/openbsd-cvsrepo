@Delete a lot of #if 0 code in libressl.

There are a few instances where #if 1 is removed but the code remains.

Based on the following OpenSSL commits.  Some of the commits weren't
strictly deletions so they are going to be split up into separate commits.

1.1.1.1
log
@Import of SSLeay-0.9.0b with RSA and IDEA stubbed + OpenBSD build
functionality for shared libs.

Note that routines such as sslv2_init and friends that use RSA will
not work due to lack of RSA in this library.

Needs documentation and help from ports for easy upgrade to full
functionality where legally possible.
