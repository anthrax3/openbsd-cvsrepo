@s/assember/assembler/ before someone gets offended.  At the last
hackathon, just saying 'ass ember' was enough to start giggles.
Unfortunately far more offensive stuff remains in here...

@RIPEMD-160
http://www.esat.kuleuven.ac.be/~bosselae/ripemd160.html

This is my implementation of RIPEMD-160.  The pentium assembler is a little
off the pace since I only get 1050 cycles, while the best is 1013.
I have a few ideas for how to get another 20 or so cycles, but at
this point I will not bother right now.  I believe the trick will be
to remove my 'copy X array onto stack' until inside the RIP1() finctions the
first time round.  To do this I need another register and will only have one
temporary one.  A bit tricky....  I can also cleanup the saving of the 5 words
after the first half of the calculation.  I should read the origional
value, add then write.  Currently I just save the new and read the origioal.
I then read both at the end.  Bad.

@Import of SSLeay-0.9.0b with RSA and IDEA stubbed + OpenBSD build
functionality for shared libs.

Note that routines such as sslv2_init and friends that use RSA will
not work due to lack of RSA in this library.

Needs documentation and help from ports for easy upgrade to full
functionality where legally possible.
