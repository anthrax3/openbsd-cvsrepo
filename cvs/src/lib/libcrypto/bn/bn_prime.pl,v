@Try to clean the maze of <openssl/bn.h> defines regarding the BN internals.

The intent of this change is to only keep support for two kind of architectures:
- those with 32-bit int and long, and 64-bit long long, where
  ``long * long -> long long'' multiplication routines are available.
- those with 64-bit int and long, and no 128-bit long long type.

This gets rid of the SIXTY_FOUR_BIT_LONG, SIXTY_FOUR_BIT (not the same!),
THIRTY_TWO_BIT, SIXTEEN_BIT and EIGHT_BIT defines.

After this change, the types and defines are as follows:

arch:           64bit           32bit           rationale
BN_LLONG        undefined       defined         defined if l * l -> ll
BN_ULLONG       undefined       u long long     result of BN_LONG * BN_LONG
BN_ULONG        u long          u int           native register size
BN_LONG         long            int             the same, signed
BN_BITS         128             64              size of 2*BN_ULONG in bits
BN_BYTES        8               4               size of 2*BN_ULONG in bytes
BN_BITS2        64              32              BN_BITS / 2

Tested on various 32-bit and 64-bit OpenBSD systems of various endianness.

@OpenSSL 0.9.5 merge

*warning* this bumps shared lib minors for libssl and libcrypto from 2.1 to 2.2
if you are using the ssl26 packages for ssh and other things to work you will
need to get new ones (see ~beck/libsslsnap/<arch>) on cvs or ~beck/src-patent.tar.gz on cvs

@Import of SSLeay-0.9.0b with RSA and IDEA stubbed + OpenBSD build
functionality for shared libs.

Note that routines such as sslv2_init and friends that use RSA will
not work due to lack of RSA in this library.

Needs documentation and help from ports for easy upgrade to full
functionality where legally possible.
