@Move build machinery for libcrypto from libssl/crypto to libcrypto, as well
as configuration files; split manpages and .pc files between libcrypto and
libssl.
No functional change, only there to make engineering easier, and libcrypto
sources are still found in libssl/src/crypto at the moment.

ok reyk@@, also discussed with deraadt@@ beck@@ and the usual crypto suspects.
