.TH wresize 3 ""

.SH NAME
\fBwresize\fR - resize a curses window

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB#include <curses.h>\fR

\fBint wresize(WINDOW *win, int lines, int columns);\fR

.SH DESCRIPTION 
The \fBwresize\fR function adjusts the dimensions of an \fBncurses\fR
window to the specified values, reallocating storage as necessary.

If either dimension is larger than the current values, the window's
data is filled with blanks that have the current background rendition
(as set by \fBwbkgndset\fR) merged into them.  If the current cursor
position is outside the retained area of the window, the cursor is
moved to within the nearest window edge.  Window data is otherwise
preserved.

This function will fail if either of the new dimensions less than or
equal to zero, or if memory cannot be allocated or reallocated for the
window.

Note that \fBwresize\fR performs non-reentrant \fBmalloc\fR(3x)
operations, so it isn't advisable to resize from within an interrupt handler.
Instead, have your handler set an event flag to be interpreted next time
around your program's command loop.

.SH PORTABILITY
This call was designed for \fBncurses\fR(3x), and is not found in SVr4
curses, 4.4BSD curses, or any other previous version of curses.  It
is recommended that you conditionalize all code depending on it with
the symbol NCURSES.

.SH RETURN VALUE
The function returns the integer \fBERR\fR upon failure and \fBOK\fR
on success.
