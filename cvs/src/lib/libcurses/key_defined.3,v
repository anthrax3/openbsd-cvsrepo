@Update to ncurses 5.7, with local changes reapplied.

This is around eight years worth of changes (previously we were around ncurses
5.2), too many to list - many bug fixes and also a few new functions.

A major bump for libcurses, libpanel, libform and libmenu.

.SH NAME
\fBkey_defined\fP \- check if a keycode is defined
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB#include <curses.h>\fP
.sp
\fBint key_defined(const char *definition);\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
This is an extension to the curses library.
It permits an application to determine if a string is currently bound
to any keycode.
.SH RETURN VALUE
If the string is bound to a keycode, its value (greater than zero) is returned.
If no keycode is bound, zero is returned.
If the string conflicts with longer strings which are bound to keys, -1 is returned.
.SH PORTABILITY
These routines are specific to ncurses.  They were not supported on
Version 7, BSD or System V implementations.  It is recommended that
any code depending on them be conditioned using NCURSES_VERSION.
