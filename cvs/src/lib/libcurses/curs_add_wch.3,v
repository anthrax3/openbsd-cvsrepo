log
@Enable wide character support in ncurses. It is built into libcurses,
libform, libmenu, libpanel and each library is also linked to a
corresponding "w" version.

This is a major bump for all four libraries.

Thanks to landry, stsp, sthen, naddy, oga, Martin Pieuchot, and anyone
else I've forgotten for testing.

.B "int wadd_wch( WINDOW *\fIwin\fP, const cchar_t *\fIwch\fB );"

.B "int wecho_wchar( WINDOW *\fIwin\fP, const cchar_t *\fIwch\fB );"
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The
\fBadd_wch\fP,
\fBwadd_wch\fP,
\fBmvadd_wch\fP, and
\fBmvwadd_wch\fP
functions put the complex character \fIwch\fP into the given
window at its current position,
which is then advanced.
These functions perform
wrapping and special-character processing as follows:
.TP 5
-
If \fIwch\fP refers to a spacing character,
then any previous character at that location is removed.
A new character specified by \fIwch\fP is
placed at that location with rendition specified by \fIwch\fP.
The cursor then advances to
the next spacing character on the screen.
.TP 5
-
If \fIwch\fP refers to a non-spacing character,
all previous characters at that location are preserved.
The non-spacing characters of \fIwch\fP
are added to the spacing complex character,
and the rendition specified by \fIwch\fP is ignored.
.TP 5
-
If the character part of \fIwch\fP is
a tab, newline, backspace or other control character,
the window is updated and the cursor moves as if \fBaddch\fR were called.
.PP
The \fBecho_wchar\fP
function is functionally equivalent to a call to
\fBadd_wch\fP
followed by a call to
\fBrefresh\fP.
Similarly, the
\fBwecho_wchar\fP
is functionally equivalent to a call to
\fBwadd_wch\fP
followed by a call to
\fBwrefresh\fP.
The knowledge
that only a single character is being output is taken into consideration and,
for non-control characters, a considerable performance gain might be seen
by using the *\fBecho\fP* functions instead of their equivalents.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.PP
All routines return the integer \fBERR\fR upon failure and \fBOK\fR on success.
.SH NOTES
.PP
Note that
\fBadd_wch\fP,
\fBmvadd_wch\fP,
\fBmvwadd_wch\fP, and
\fBecho_wchar\fP
may be macros.
.SH PORTABILITY
.PP
All these functions are described in the XSI Curses standard, Issue 4.
The defaults specified for forms-drawing characters apply in the POSIX locale.
.PP
XSI documents constants beginning with \fBWACS_\fP which are used for
line-drawing.
Those are not currently implemented in \fBncurses\fP.
