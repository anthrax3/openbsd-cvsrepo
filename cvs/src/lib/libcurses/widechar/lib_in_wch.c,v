1.1
log
@Enable wide character support in ncurses. It is built into libcurses,
libform, libmenu, libpanel and each library is also linked to a
corresponding "w" version.

This is a major bump for all four libraries.

Thanks to landry, stsp, sthen, naddy, oga, Martin Pieuchot, and anyone
else I've forgotten for testing.
