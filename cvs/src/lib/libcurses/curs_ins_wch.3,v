@Enable wide character support in ncurses. It is built into libcurses,
libform, libmenu, libpanel and each library is also linked to a
corresponding "w" version.

This is a major bump for all four libraries.

Thanks to landry, stsp, sthen, naddy, oga, Martin Pieuchot, and anyone
else I've forgotten for testing.

\fBwins_wch\fR \- insert a complex character and rendition into a window
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <curses.h>
.sp
\fBint ins_wch(const cchar_t *\fR\fIwch\fR\fB);\fR
.br
\fBint wins_wch(WINDOW *\fR\fIwin, const cchar_t *\fR\fIwch\fR\fB);\fR

.br
\fBint mvwins_wch(WINDOW *\fR\fIwin, int \fR\fIy, int \fR\fIx, const cchar_t *\fR\fIwch\fR\fB);\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
These routines, insert the complex character \fIwch\fR with rendition
before the character under the cursor.
All characters to the right of the cursor are moved one space to the right,
with the possibility of the rightmost character on the line being lost.
The insertion operation does not change the cursor position.
.SH RETURN VALUE
If successful, these functions return OK.
If not, they return ERR.
.SH ERRORS
