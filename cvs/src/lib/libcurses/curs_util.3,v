@Update to ncurses 5.7, with local changes reapplied.

This is around eight years worth of changes (previously we were around ncurses
5.2), too many to list - many bug fixes and also a few new functions.

A major bump for libcurses, libpanel, libform and libmenu.

.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBunctrl\fR routine returns a character string which is a printable
representation of the character \fIc\fR, ignoring attributes.
Control characters are displayed in the \fB^\fR\fIX\fR notation.
Printing characters are displayed as is.
The corresponding \fBwunctrl\fR returns a printable representation of
a wide-character.
.PP
The \fBkeyname\fR routine returns a character string corresponding to the key \fIc\fR:
.RS 3
.TP 3
-
Printable characters are displayed as themselves, e.g., a one-character string containing the key.
.TP 3
-
Control characters are displayed in the \fB^\fR\fIX\fR notation.
.TP 3
-
DEL (character 127) is displayed as \fB^?\fP.
.TP 3
-
Values above 128 are either meta characters
(if the screen has not been initialized,
or if \fBmeta\fP has been called with a TRUE parameter),
shown in the \fBM-\fR\fIX\fR notation,
or are displayed as themselves.
In the latter case, the values may not be printable;
this follows the X/Open specification.
.TP 3
-
Values above 256 may be the names of the names of function keys.
.TP 3
-
Otherwise (if there is no corresponding name) the function returns null,
to denote an error.
X/Open also lists an "UNKNOWN KEY" return value, which some implementations
return rather than null.
.RE
.LP
The corresponding \fBkey_name\fR returns a character string corresponding
to the wide-character value \fIw\fR.
The two functions do not return the same set of strings;
the latter returns null where the former would display a meta character.
.PP
The \fBfilter\fR routine, if used, must be called before \fBinitscr\fR or
\fBnewterm\fR are called.  The effect is that, during those calls, \fBLINES\fR
is set to 1; the capabilities \fBclear\fR, \fBcup\fR, \fBcud\fR, \fBcud1\fR,
\fBcuu1\fR, \fBcuu\fR, \fBvpa\fR are disabled; and the \fBhome\fR string is
set to the value of \fBcr\fR.
.PP
The \fBnofilter\fP routine cancels the effect of a preceding \fBfilter\fP
call.
That allows the caller to initialize a screen on a different device,
using a different value of \fB$TERM\fP.
The limitation arises because the \fBfilter\fP routine modifies the
in-memory copy of the terminal information.
.PP
The \fBuse_env\fR routine, if used, is called before \fBinitscr\fR or
\fBnewterm\fR are called.  When called with \fBFALSE\fR as an
argument, the values of \fBlines\fR and \fBcolumns\fR specified in the
\fIterminfo\fR database will be used, even if environment variables
\fBLINES\fR and \fBCOLUMNS\fR (used by default) are set, or if
\fBcurses\fR is running in a window (in which case default behavior
would be to use the window size if \fBLINES\fR and \fBCOLUMNS\fR are
not set).
Note that setting \fBLINES\fR or \fBCOLUMNS\fR overrides the
corresponding size which may be obtained from the operating system.
.PP
The \fBputwin\fR routine writes all data associated with window \fIwin\fR into
the file to which \fIfilep\fR points.  This information can be later retrieved
using the \fBgetwin\fR function.
.PP
The \fBgetwin\fR routine reads window related data stored in the file by
\fBputwin\fR.  The routine then creates and initializes a new window using that
data.  It returns a pointer to the new window.
.PP
The \fBdelay_output\fR routine inserts an \fIms\fR millisecond pause
in output.  This routine should not be used extensively because
padding characters are used rather than a CPU pause.
If no padding character is specified, this uses \fBnapms\fR to perform the delay.
.PP
The \fBflushinp\fR routine throws away any typeahead that has been typed by the
user and has not yet been read by the program.
.SH RETURN VALUE
Except for \fBflushinp\fR, routines that return an integer return \fBERR\fR
upon failure and \fBOK\fR (SVr4 specifies only "an integer value other than
\fBERR\fR") upon successful completion.
.PP
Routines that return pointers return \fBNULL\fR on error.
.PP
X/Open does not define any error conditions.
In this implementation
.RS 3
.TP 5
\fBflushinp\fR
returns an error if the terminal was not initialized.
.TP 5
\fBmeta\fR
returns an error if the terminal was not initialized.
.TP 5
\fBputwin\fP
returns an error if the associated \fBfwrite\fP calls return an error.
.RE
.SH PORTABILITY
The XSI Curses standard, Issue 4 describes these functions.
It states that \fBunctrl\fR and \fBwunctrl\fR will return a null pointer if
unsuccessful, but does not define any error conditions.
This implementation checks for three cases:
.RS
.TP 5
-
the parameter is a 7-bit US-ASCII code.
This is the case that X/Open Curses documented.
.TP 5
-
the parameter is in the range 128-159, i.e., a C1 control code.
If \fBuse_legacy_coding\fP has been called with a \fB2\fP parameter,
\fBunctrl\fP returns the parameter, i.e., a one-character string with
the parameter as the first character.
Otherwise, it returns ``~@@'', ``~A'', etc., analogous to ``^@@'', ``^A'', C0 controls.
.IP
X/Open Curses does not document whether \fBunctrl\fP can be called before
initializing curses.
This implementation permits that,
and returns the ``~@@'', etc., values in that case.
.TP 5
-
parameter values outside the 0 to 255 range.
\fBunctrl\fP returns a null pointer.
.RE
.PP
The SVr4 documentation describes the action of \fBfilter\fR only in the vaguest
terms.  The description here is adapted from the XSI Curses standard (which
erroneously fails to describe the disabling of \fBcuu\fR).
.PP
The strings returned by \fBunctrl\fR in this implementation are determined
at compile time,
showing C1 controls from the upper-128 codes with a `~' prefix rather than `^'.
Other implementations have different conventions.
For example, they may show both sets of control characters with `^',
and strip the parameter to 7 bits.
Or they may ignore C1 controls and treat all of the upper-128 codes as
printable.
This implementation uses 8 bits but does not modify the string to reflect
locale.
The \fBuse_legacy_coding\fP function allows the caller to
change the output of \fBunctrl\fP.
.PP
Likewise, the \fBmeta\fP function allows the caller to change the
output of \fBkeyname\fP, i.e.,
it determines whether to use the `M-' prefix
for ``meta'' keys (codes in the range 128 to 255).
Both \fBuse_legacy_coding\fP and \fBmeta\fP succeed only after
curses is initialized. 
X/Open Curses does not document the treatment of codes 128 to 159.
When treating them as ``meta'' keys
(or if \fBkeyname\fP is called before initializing curses),
this implementation returns strings ``M-^@@'', ``M-^A'', etc.
.PP
The \fBkeyname\fP function may return the names of user-defined
string capabilities which are defined in the terminfo entry via the \fB-x\fP
option of \fBtic\fP.
This implementation automatically assigns at run-time keycodes to 
user-defined strings which begin with "k".
The keycodes start at KEY_MAX, but are not guaranteed to be 
the same value for different runs because user-defined codes are
merged from all terminal descriptions which have been loaded.
The \fBuse_extended_names\fP function controls whether this data is
loaded when the terminal description is read by the library.
.PP
The \fBnofilter\fP routine is specific to ncurses.
It was not supported on Version 7, BSD or System V implementations.
It is recommended that any code depending on ncurses extensions
be conditioned using NCURSES_VERSION.

The \fBunctrl\fR macro expands to a character string which is a printable
representation of the character \fIc\fR.  Control characters are displayed in
the \fB^\fR\fIX\fR notation.  Printing characters are displayed as is.

The \fBkeyname\fR routine returns a character string corresponding to
the key \fIc\fR.
