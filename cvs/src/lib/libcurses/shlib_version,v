@Disable the USE_OLD_TTY hack that re-encoded termios Bnnn speeds
as sgtty Bnnn speeds.  This means ospeed has to grow from short to
int to hold all possible values.  Bump major version.

While there, also fix a bug in _nc_baudrate().

1.20
log
@Switch time_t, ino_t, clock_t, and struct kevent's ident and data
members to 64bit types.  Assign new syscall numbers for (almost
all) the syscalls that involve the affected types, including anything
with time_t, timeval, itimerval, timespec, rusage, dirent, stat,
or kevent arguments.  Add a d_off member to struct dirent and replace
getdirentries() with getdents(), thus immensely simplifying and
accelerating telldir/seekdir.  Build perl with -DBIG_TIME.

Bump the major on every single base library: the compat bits included
here are only good enough to make the transition; the T32 compat
option will be burned as soon as we've reached the new world are
are happy with the snapshots for all architectures.

DANGER: ABI incompatibility.  Updating to this kernel requires extra
work or you won't be able to login: install a snapshot instead.

@Enable wide character support in ncurses. It is built into libcurses,
libform, libmenu, libpanel and each library is also linked to a
corresponding "w" version.

This is a major bump for all four libraries.

Thanks to landry, stsp, sthen, naddy, oga, Martin Pieuchot, and anyone
else I've forgotten for testing.

@Update to ncurses 5.7, with local changes reapplied.

This is around eight years worth of changes (previously we were around ncurses
5.2), too many to list - many bug fixes and also a few new functions.

A major bump for libcurses, libpanel, libform and libmenu.

@Crank all library major numbers.  Needed due to the fact that we
now build libraries with propolice enabled.  Without this, existing
binaries (such as ports/packages) that link with any system library
other than libc will fail with an undefined symbol of "___guard"
(__guard on ELF).

@Enable extended cap names.  Previously, the only allowed cap names were
those explicitly listed in term.h.  With extended names, non-standard
terminfo/termcap capabilities are passed through for those programs that
want to use them (screen for instance).  This changes struct term and
therefor requires a library major increment.  It also requires changing
how the terminfo.db file is parsed.  Previously, it was parsed like:
foreach cap (all_possible_caps) if ( is_listed(cap) ) add_cap(cap)
However, now that we can't know the set of all possible capabilities
we need to convert the buffer we get back from cgetent into one that
looks more like a terminfo entry and pass it through to the ncurses
terminfo parsing routines.  This also enables tic's -x flag.
