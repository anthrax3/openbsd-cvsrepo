@move the ohash functions into libutil by popular demand.
It's not a standard interface, so it doesn't belong in libc.
I hate duplicating the code in client programs, so do beck@@, kettenis@@,
schwarze@@, millert@@, miod@@... and they agree with libutil.

.Sh NAME
.Nm ohash_interval ,
.Nm ohash_create_entry ,
.Nm ohash_qlookup ,
.Nm ohash_qlookupi
.Nd helper functions for open hashing
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In stdint.h
.In stddef.h
.In ohash.h
.Ft uint32_t
.Fn ohash_interval "const char *start" "const char **pend"
.Ft "void *"
.Fn ohash_create_entry "struct ohash_info *info" "const char *start" "const char **pend"
.Ft "unsigned int"
.Fn ohash_qlookupi "struct ohash *h" "const char *start" "const char **pend"
.Ft "unsigned int"
.Fn ohash_qlookup "struct ohash *h" "const char *start"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
These functions are commonly used to simplify open hashing usage, and use
similar conventions.
They operate indifferently on NUL-terminated strings
.Po
by setting
.Fa *pend
=
.Dv NULL
.Pc
or memory ranges
.Po
delimited by
.Fa start
and
.Fa *pend
.Pc .
For NUL-terminated strings, as a side effect, those functions
set
.Fa *pend
to the terminating NUL byte.
.Pp
.Fn ohash_interval
is a simple hashing function that yields good results on common data sets.
.Pp
.Fn ohash_create_entry
can be used to create a new record with a given key.
In that case,
the alloc field of
.Fa info
should point to a
.Xr malloc 3 Ns -like
function to allocate the storage:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
p = (*info->alloc)(sz, info->data);
.Ed
.Pp
.Fn ohash_qlookupi
is a wrapper function that simply calls
.Fn ohash_interval
and
.Fn ohash_lookup_interval .
.Pp
.Fn ohash_qlookup
is a variation on
.Fn ohash_qlookupi
designed for NUL-terminated strings.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr ohash_init 3
.Sh STANDARDS
Those functions are completely non-standard and should be avoided in
portable programs.
.Sh HISTORY
Those functions were designed and written for
.Ox
.Xr make 1
by Marc Espie in 1999.
