.Fd #include <util.h>
.Ft void
.Fn pw_getconf "char *data" "size_t len" "const char *key" "const char *option"

.Pa option
from the section given by
.Pa key .
If no suitable entry is found
for the
.Pa key
an empty string will be returned in data.
.Pp
For default values the key
.Pa default
can be used.
This might be useful when no entry was found
for a specific key or option.
.Pp
An empty string is also returned for other errors.

.It Pa /etc/passwd.conf

- fix remaining .Nm usage as well
- this is from a patch I received from kwesterback@@home.com, who has been
  working on some scripts for fixing formatting errors in mdoc'd man pages

Ok, so there could be a cost/benefit debate with this commit, but since I have
the patch we might as well commit it...
