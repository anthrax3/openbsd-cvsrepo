.Sh NAME
.Nm bcrypt_pbkdf
.Nd bcrypt password-based key derivation function
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In util.h
.Ft int
.Fn bcrypt_pbkdf "const char *pass" "size_t pass_len" "const uint8_t *salt" \
    "size_t salt_len" "uint8_t *key" "size_t key_len" "unsigned int rounds"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
function converts a password into a byte array suitable for use as
an encryption key.
The password and salt values are combined and repeatedly hashed
.Ar rounds
times.
The salt value should be randomly generated beforehand.
The repeated hashing is designed to thwart discovery of the key via
password guessing attacks.
The higher the number of rounds, the slower each attempt will be.
.\" A minimum value of at least 4 is recommended.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn bcrypt_pbkdf
function returns 0 to indicate success and \-1 for failure.

.\" .Sh HISTORY
.\" .Sh AUTHORS
.Sh CAVEATS
This implementation deviates slightly from the PBKDF2 standard by mixing
output key bits nonlinearly.
By mixing the output bytes together, an attacker is required to perform
all of the work without taking any shortcuts.

@Explain why we deviate slightly from the PBKDF2 standard.

This explanation is based off of Ted's site.  Also, fix a comment from
the SHA-1 version.

1.1
log
@Add bcrypt_pbkdf, a password based key derivation function using bcrypt.
Technically, it's a slight variant of bcrypt better suited for use as a
pluggable hash with PKCS #5 PBKDF2.

(also tweak pkcs5_pbkdf2() prototype to have consistent types.)
