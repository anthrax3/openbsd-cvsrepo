.Dt PW_LOCK 3
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm pw_lock ,
.Nm pw_mkdb ,
.Nm pw_abort
.Nd passwd file update functions
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In util.h
.Ft int
.Fn pw_lock "int retries"
.Ft int
.Fn pw_mkdb "char *username" "int pwflags"
.Ft void
.Fn pw_abort void
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn pw_lock ,
.Fn pw_mkdb ,
and
.Fn pw_abort
functions allow a program to update the system passwd database.
.Pp
The
.Fn pw_lock
function attempts to lock the passwd database by creating the file
.Pa /etc/ptmp ,
and returns the file descriptor of that file.
If
.Fa retries
is greater than zero,
.Fn pw_lock
will try multiple times to open
.Pa /etc/ptmp ,
waiting one second between tries.
In addition to being a lock file,
.Pa /etc/ptmp
will also hold the contents of the new passwd file.
A different lock file can be specified with
.Xr pw_file 3 .
.Pp
.Xr pw_init 3
must be called before
.Fn pw_lock .
.Pp
The
.Fn pw_mkdb
function updates the passwd file from the contents of
.Pa /etc/ptmp
via
.Xr pwd_mkdb 8 .
If a
.Fa username
is specified, only the record for the specified user will be updated.
The
.Fa pwflags
are specified by OR'ing the following values:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width _PASSWORD_SECUREONLY -offset "xxxx" -compact
.It Dv _PASSWORD_SECUREONLY
only update the secure database file
.Pq Pa /etc/spwd.db .
.It Dv _PASSWORD_OMITV7
do not update the legacy password file
.Pq Pa /etc/passwd .
.El
.Pp
By default the secure and insecure password databases and
the legacy password file
.Pa /etc/passwd
are updated.
You should finish writing to and close the file descriptor returned by
.Fn pw_lock
before calling
.Fn pw_mkdb .
If
.Fn pw_mkdb
fails and you do not wish to retry, you should make sure to call
.Fn pw_abort
to clean up the lock file.
.Pp
The
.Fn pw_abort
function aborts a passwd file update by deleting
.Pa /etc/ptmp .
The passwd database remains unchanged.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn pw_lock
function returns \-1 on error and sets
.Va errno .
The
.Fn pw_mkdb
function returns \-1 if it is unable to complete properly.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width "/etc/master.passwdXXX" -compact
.It Pa /etc/master.passwd
Current password file.
.It Pa /etc/passwd
Legacy password file.
.It Pa /etc/ptmp
Password lock file.
.It Pa /etc/pwd.db
Insecure password database file.
.It Pa /etc/spwd.db
Secure password database file.
.El
.Sh ERRORS
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EINVAL
.Fn pw_lock
was called before
.Xr pw_init 3 .
.El
.Pp
.Fn pw_lock
may also fail and set
.Va errno
for any of the errors specified for the routine
.Xr open 2 .
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr pw_file 3 ,
.Xr pw_init 3 ,
.Xr pwd_mkdb 8

@Change the second arg to pw_mkdb() from a boolean flag to a set of
bit flags ORed together.  Currently the only flags defined are
_PASSWORD_SECUREONLY and _PASSWORD_OMITV7 but this is enough to
cause pw_mkdb() to run pwd_mkdb with the options we want.

With this change we no longer generate the old V7 passwd file when
only the extra fields in master.passwd (or the encrypted password)
have changed.  There are other programs that could probably use
the _PASSWORD_OMITV7 flag; they will be converted at a future date.
