log
@Make reset_prog_mode() and reset_shell_mode() in libtermlib weak
symbols so that they get overridden by the ones in libcurses.
This is rather gross but the curses versions are tightly coupled
to naughty bits private to libcurses.  This allows reset_prog_mode()
and reset_shell_mode() to operate properly both with an without
libcurses linked in.
