@Re-implement htpasswd from scratch. There is so much bad advice on the
internet that it's better to have a known tool in base.
Intentionally not switch compatible with the old htpasswd. The only
switch really needed would be for batch mode, but that was inherently
insecure in the old htpasswd. Batch mode will be coming shortly.
