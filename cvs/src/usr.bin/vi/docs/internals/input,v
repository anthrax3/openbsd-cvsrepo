MAPS, EXECUTABLE BUFFERS AND INPUT IN EX/VI:

The basic rule is that input in ex/vi is a stack.  Every time a key which
gets expanded is encountered, it is expanded and the expansion is treated
as if it were input from the user.  So, maps and executable buffers are
simply pushed onto the stack from which keys are returned.  The exception
is that if the "remap" option is turned off, only a single map expansion
is done.  I intend to be fully backward compatible with this.

Historically, if the mode of the editor changed (ex to vi or vice versa),
any queued input was silently discarded.  I don't see any reason to either
support or not support this semantic.  I intend to retain the queued input,
mostly because it's simpler than throwing it away.

Historically, neither the initial command on the command line (the + flag)
or the +cmd associated with the ex and edit commands was subject to mapping.
Also, while the +cmd appears to be subject to "@@buffer" expansion, once
expanded it doesn't appear to work correctly.  I don't see any reason to
either support or not support these semantics, so, for consistency, I intend
to pass both the initial command and the command associated with ex and edit
commands through the standard mapping and @@ buffer expansion.

One other difference between the historic ex/vi and nex/nvi is that nex
displays the executed buffers as it executes them.  This means that if
the file is:

	set term=xterm
	set term=yterm
	set term=yterm

the user will see the following during a typical edit session:

	nex testfile
	testfile: unmodified: line 3
	:1,$yank a
	:@@a
	:set term=zterm
	:set term=yterm
	:set term=xterm
	:q!

This seems like a feature and unlikely to break anything, so I don't
intend to match historic practice in this area.

The rest of this document is a set of conclusions as to how I believe
the historic maps and @@ buffers work.  The summary is as follows:

1: For buffers that are cut in "line mode", or buffers that are not cut
   in line mode but which contain portions of more than a single line, a
   trailing <newline> character appears in the input for each line in the
   buffer when it is executed.  For buffers not cut in line mode and which
   contain portions of only a single line, no additional characters
   appear in the input.
2: Executable buffers that execute other buffers don't load their
   contents until they execute them.
3: Maps and executable buffers are copied when they are executed --
   they can be modified by the command but that does not change their
   actions.
4: Historically, executable buffers are discarded if the editor
   switches between ex and vi modes.
5: Executable buffers inside of map commands are expanded normally.
   Maps inside of executable buffers are expanded normally.
6: If an error is encountered while executing a mapped command or buffer,
   the rest of the mapped command/buffer is discarded.  No user input
   characters are discarded.
7: Characters in executable buffers are remapped.
8: Characters in executable buffers are not quoted.

Individual test cases follow.  Note, in the test cases, control characters
are not literal and will have to be replaced to make the test cases work.

   The cursor ends up on the 'f' in "foo" in the fifth line of the
