1.2
log
@the environment handling code was showing its age. just because environ
is a char** array doesn't mean we must exclusively operate on such.
convert to a red-black tree, manipulate as desired, then flatten to array.
potentially overkill for the current operations, but reading the tea leaves
i see that more manipulations are desired.
ok tb
(and some thought provoking disagreement from martijn)
