@Update to ncurses 5.7, with local changes reapplied.

This is around eight years worth of changes (previously we were around ncurses
5.2), too many to list - many bug fixes and also a few new functions.

A major bump for libcurses, libpanel, libform and libmenu.

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBinfocmp\fR can be used to compare a binary \fBterminfo\fR entry with other
terminfo entries, rewrite a \fBterminfo\fR description to take advantage of the
\fBuse=\fR terminfo field, or print out a \fBterminfo\fR description from the
binary file (\fBterm\fR) in a variety of formats.  In all cases, the boolean
fields will be printed first, followed by the numeric fields, followed by the
string fields.
.SS Default Options
If no options are specified and zero or one \fItermnames\fR are specified, the
\fB-I\fR option will be assumed.  If more than one \fItermname\fR is specified,
the \fB-d\fR option will be assumed.
.SS Comparison Options [-d] [-c] [-n]
\fBinfocmp\fR compares the \fBterminfo\fR description of the first terminal
\fItermname\fR with each of the descriptions given by the entries for the other
terminal's \fItermnames\fR.  If a capability is defined for only one of the
terminals, the value returned will depend on the type of the capability:
\fBF\fR for boolean variables, \fB-1\fR for integer variables, and \fBNULL\fR
for string variables.
.PP
The \fB-d\fR option produces a list of each capability that is different
between two entries.  This option is useful to show the difference between two
entries, created by different people, for the same or similar terminals.
.PP
The \fB-c\fR option produces a list of each capability that is common between
two entries.  Capabilities that are not set are ignored.  This option can be
used as a quick check to see if the \fB-u\fR option is worth using.
.PP
The \fB-n\fR option produces a list of each capability that is in neither
entry.  If no \fItermnames\fR are given, the environment variable \fBTERM\fR
will be used for both of the \fItermnames\fR.  This can be used as a quick
check to see if anything was left out of a description.
.SS Source Listing Options [-I] [-L] [-C] [-r]
The \fB-I\fR, \fB-L\fR, and \fB-C\fR options will produce a source listing for
each terminal named.
.
.TS
center tab(/) ;
l l .
\fB-I\fR/use the \fBterminfo\fR names
\fB-L\fR/use the long C variable name listed in <\fBterm.h\fR>
\fB-C\fR/use the \fBtermcap\fR names
\fB-r\fR/when using \fB-C\fR, put out all capabilities in \fBtermcap\fR form
.TE
.PP
If no \fItermnames\fR are given, the environment variable \fBTERM\fR will be
used for the terminal name.
.PP
The source produced by the \fB-C\fR option may be used directly as a
\fBtermcap\fR entry, but not all parameterized strings can be changed to
the \fBtermcap\fR format.  \fBinfocmp\fR will attempt to convert most of the
parameterized information, and anything not converted will be plainly marked in
the output and commented out.  These should be edited by hand.
.PP
All padding information for strings will be collected together and placed
at the beginning of the string where \fBtermcap\fR expects it.  Mandatory
padding (padding information with a trailing '/') will become optional.
.PP
All \fBtermcap\fR variables no longer supported by \fBterminfo\fR, but which
are derivable from other \fBterminfo\fR variables, will be output.  Not all
\fBterminfo\fR capabilities will be translated; only those variables which were
part of \fBtermcap\fR will normally be output.  Specifying the \fB-r\fR option
will take off this restriction, allowing all capabilities to be output in
\fItermcap\fR form.
.PP
Note that because padding is collected to the beginning of the capability, not
all capabilities are output.  Mandatory padding is not supported.  Because
\fBtermcap\fR strings are not as flexible, it is not always possible to convert
a \fBterminfo\fR string capability into an equivalent \fBtermcap\fR format.  A
subsequent conversion of the \fBtermcap\fR file back into \fBterminfo\fR format
will not necessarily reproduce the original \fBterminfo\fR
source.
.PP
Some common \fBterminfo\fR parameter sequences, their \fBtermcap\fR
equivalents, and some terminal types which commonly have such sequences, are:

\fB%p2\fR is printed before \fB%p1/%r\fR/hp
.TE
.SS Use= Option [-u]
The \fB-u\fR option produces a \fBterminfo\fR source description of the first
terminal \fItermname\fR which is relative to the sum of the descriptions given
by the entries for the other terminals \fItermnames\fR.  It does this by
analyzing the differences between the first \fItermname\fR and the other
\fItermnames\fR and producing a description with \fBuse=\fR fields for the
other terminals.  In this manner, it is possible to retrofit generic terminfo
entries into a terminal's description.  Or, if two similar terminals exist, but
were coded at different times or by different people so that each description
is a full description, using \fBinfocmp\fR will show what can be done to change
one description to be relative to the other.
.PP
A capability will get printed with an at-sign (@@) if it no longer exists in the
first \fItermname\fR, but one of the other \fItermname\fR entries contains a
value for it.  A capability's value gets printed if the value in the first
\fItermname\fR is not found in any of the other \fItermname\fR entries, or if
the first of the other \fItermname\fR entries that has this capability gives a
different value for the capability than that in the first \fItermname\fR.
.PP
The order of the other \fItermname\fR entries is significant.  Since the
terminfo compiler \fBtic\fR does a left-to-right scan of the capabilities,
specifying two \fBuse=\fR entries that contain differing entries for the same
capabilities will produce different results depending on the order that the
entries are given in.  \fBinfocmp\fR will flag any such inconsistencies between
the other \fItermname\fR entries as they are found.
.PP
Alternatively, specifying a capability \fIafter\fR a \fBuse=\fR entry that
contains that capability will cause the second specification to be ignored.
Using \fBinfocmp\fR to recreate a description can be a useful check to make
sure that everything was specified correctly in the original source
description.
.PP
Another error that does not cause incorrect compiled files, but will slow down
the compilation time, is specifying extra \fBuse=\fR fields that are
superfluous.  \fBinfocmp\fR will flag any other \fItermname use=\fR fields that
were not needed.
.SS Changing Databases [-A \fIdirectory\fR] [-B \fIdirectory\fR]
The location of the compiled \fBterminfo\fR database is taken from the
environment variable \fBTERMINFO\fR .  If the variable is not defined, or the
terminal is not found in that location, the system \fBterminfo\fR database,
in \fB/usr/share/terminfo\fR, will be used.  The options \fB-A\fR
and \fB-B\fR may be used to override this location.  The \fB-A\fR option will
set \fBTERMINFO\fR for the first \fItermname\fR and the \fB-B\fR option will
set \fBTERMINFO\fR for the other \fItermnames\fR.  With this, it is possible to
compare descriptions for a terminal with the same name located in two different
databases.  This is useful for comparing descriptions for the same terminal
created by different people.
.SS Other Options
.TP 5
\fB-1\fR
causes the fields to be printed out one to a line.  Otherwise,
the fields will be printed several to a line to a maximum width
of 60 characters.
.TP
\fB-a\fR
tells \fBinfocmp\fP to retain commented-out capabilities rather than discarding
them.  Capabilities are commented by prefixing them with a period.
.TP 5
\fB-E\fR
Dump the capabilities of the given terminal as tables, needed in
the C initializer for a
TERMTYPE structure (the terminal capability structure in the \fB<term.h>\fR).
This option is useful for preparing versions of the curses library hardwired
for a given terminal type.
The tables are all declared static, and are named according to the type
and the name of the corresponding terminal entry.
.sp
Before ncurses 5.0, the split between the \fB-e\fP and \fB-E\fP
options was not needed; but support for extended names required making
the arrays of terminal capabilities separate from the TERMTYPE structure.
.TP 5
\fB-e\fR
Dump the capabilities of the given terminal as a C initializer for a
TERMTYPE structure (the terminal capability structure in the \fB<term.h>\fR).
This option is useful for preparing versions of the curses library hardwired
for a given terminal type.
.TP 5
\fB-F\fR
compare terminfo files.  This assumes that two following arguments are
filenames.  The files are searched for pairwise matches between
entries, with two entries considered to match if any of their names do.
The report printed to standard output lists entries with no matches in
the other file, and entries with more than one match.  For entries
with exactly one match it includes a difference report.  Normally,
to reduce the volume of the report, use references are
not resolved before looking for differences, but resolution can be forced
by also specifying \fB-r\fR.
.TP 5
\fB-f\fR
Display complex terminfo strings which contain if/then/else/endif expressions
indented for readability.
.TP 5
\fB-G\fR
Display constant literals in decimal form
rather than their character equivalents.
.TP 5
\fB-g\fR
Display constant character literals in quoted form
rather than their decimal equivalents.
.TP 5
\fB-i\fR
Analyze the initialization (\fBis1\fR, \fBis2\fR, \fBis3\fR), and reset
(\fBrs1\fR, \fBrs2\fR, \fBrs3\fR), strings in the entry.  For each string, the
code tries to analyze it into actions in terms of the other capabilities in the
entry, certain X3.64/ISO 6429/ECMA-48 capabilities, and certain DEC VT-series
private modes (the set of recognized special sequences has been selected for
completeness over the existing terminfo database).  Each report line consists
of the capability name, followed by a colon and space, followed by a printable
expansion of the capability string with sections matching recognized actions
translated into {}-bracketed descriptions.  Here is a list of the DEC/ANSI
special sequences recognized:

.TE
.sp
It also recognizes a SGR action corresponding to ANSI/ISO 6429/ECMA Set
Graphics Rendition, with the values NORMAL, BOLD, UNDERLINE, BLINK, and
REVERSE.  All but NORMAL may be prefixed with `+' (turn on) or `-' (turn off).
.PP
An SGR0 designates an empty highlight sequence (equivalent to {SGR:NORMAL}).
.TP 5
\fB-l\fR
Set output format to terminfo.
.TP 5
\fB-p\fR
Ignore padding specifications when comparing strings.
.TP 5
\fB-q\fR
Make the comparison listing shorter by omitting subheadings, and using
"-" for absent capabilities, "@@" for canceled rather than "NULL".
.TP 5
\fB-R\fR\fIsubset\fR
Restrict output to a given subset.  This option is for use with archaic
versions of terminfo like those on SVr1, Ultrix, or HP/UX that do not support
the full set of SVR4/XSI Curses terminfo; and variants such as AIX
that have their own extensions incompatible with SVr4/XSI.  Available terminfo
subsets are "SVr1", "Ultrix", "HP", and "AIX"; see \fBterminfo\fR(\*n) for
details.  You can also choose the subset "BSD" which selects only capabilities
with termcap equivalents recognized by 4.4BSD.
.TP
\fB-s \fR\fI[d|i|l|c]\fR
The \fB-s\fR option sorts the fields within each type according to the argument
below:
.br
.RS 5
.TP 5
\fBd\fR
leave fields in the order that they are stored in the \fIterminfo\fR database.
.TP 5
\fBi\fR
sort by \fIterminfo\fR name.
.TP 5
\fBl\fR
sort by the long C variable name.
.TP 5
\fBc\fR
sort by the \fItermcap\fR name.
.RE
.IP
If the \fB-s\fR option is not given, the fields printed out will be
sorted alphabetically by the \fBterminfo\fR name within each type,
except in the case of the \fB-C\fR or the \fB-L\fR options, which cause the
sorting to be done by the \fBtermcap\fR name or the long C variable
name, respectively.
.TP 5
\fB-T\fR
eliminates size-restrictions on the generated text.
This is mainly useful for testing and analysis, since the compiled
descriptions are limited (e.g., 1023 for termcap, 4096 for terminfo).
.TP
\fB-t\fR
tells \fBtic\fP to discard commented-out capabilities.
Normally when translating from terminfo to termcap,
untranslatable capabilities are commented-out.
.TP 5
\fB-U\fR
tells \fBinfocmp\fP to not post-process the data after parsing the source file.
This feature helps when comparing the actual contents of two source files,
since it excludes the inferences that \fBinfocmp\fP makes to fill in missing
data.
.TP 5
\fB-V\fR
reports the version of ncurses which was used in this program, and exits.
.TP 5
\fB-v\fR \fIn\fR
prints out tracing information on standard error as the program runs.
Higher values of n induce greater verbosity.
.TP 5
\fB-w\fR \fIwidth\fR
changes the output to \fIwidth\fR characters.
.TP
\fB-x\fR
print information for user-defined capabilities.
These are extensions to the terminfo repertoire which can be loaded
using the \fB-x\fR option of \fBtic\fP.

.SS Other Options [-s d|i|l|c] [-1FTVefip] [-Rsubset] [-v \fIn\fR] [-w \fIwidth\fR]
The \fB-s\fR option sorts the fields within each type according to the argument
below:
..
.TP 5
\fBd\fR
leave fields in the order that they are stored in the \fIterminfo\fR database.
.TP 5
\fBi\fR
sort by \fIterminfo\fR name.
.TP 5
\fBl\fR
sort by the long C variable name.
.TP 5
\fBc\fR
sort by the \fItermcap\fR name.

If the \fB-s\fR option is not given, the fields printed out will be
sorted alphabetically by the \fBterminfo\fR name within each type,
except in the case of the \fB-C\fR or the \fB-L\fR options, which cause the
sorting to be done by the \fBtermcap\fR name or the long C variable
name, respectively.
a210 15
.TP 5
\fB-F\fR
compare terminfo files.  This assumes that two following arguments are
filenames.  The files are searched for pairwise matches between
entries, with two entries considered to match if any of their names do.
The report printed to standard output lists entries with no matches in
the other file, and entries with more than one match.  For entries
with exactly one match it includes a difference report.  Normally,
to reduce the volume of the report, use references are
not resolved before looking for differences, but resolution can be forced
by also specifying \fB-r\fR.
.TP
\fB-G\fR
Display constant literals in decimal form
rather than their character equivalents.
a215 27
\fB-q\fR
Make the comparison listing shorter by omitting subheadings, and using
"-" for absent capabilities, "@@" for canceled rather than "NULL".
.TP 5
\fB-R\fR\fIsubset\fR
Restrict output to a given subset.  This option is for use with archaic
versions of terminfo like those on SVr1, Ultrix, or HP/UX that do not support
the full set of SVR4/XSI Curses terminfo; and variants such as AIX
that have their own extensions incompatible with SVr4/XSI.  Available terminfo
subsets are "SVr1", "Ultrix", "HP", and "AIX"; see \fBterminfo\fR(\*n) for
details.  You can also choose the subset "BSD" which selects only capabilities
with termcap equivalents recognized by 4.4BSD.
.TP 5
\fB-T\fR
eliminates size-restrictions on the generated text.
This is mainly useful for testing and analysis, since the compiled
descriptions are limited (e.g., 1023 for termcap, 4096 for terminfo).
.TP 5
\fB-V\fR
reports the version of ncurses which was used in this program, and exits.
.TP 5
\fB-e\fR
Dump the capabilities of the given terminal as a C initializer for a
TERMTYPE structure (the terminal capability structure in the \fB<term.h>\fR).
This option is useful for preparing versions of the curses library hardwired
for a given terminal type.

@Enable extended cap names.  Previously, the only allowed cap names were
those explicitly listed in term.h.  With extended names, non-standard
terminfo/termcap capabilities are passed through for those programs that
want to use them (screen for instance).  This changes struct term and
therefor requires a library major increment.  It also requires changing
how the terminfo.db file is parsed.  Previously, it was parsed like:
foreach cap (all_possible_caps) if ( is_listed(cap) ) add_cap(cap)
However, now that we can't know the set of all possible capabilities
we need to convert the buffer we get back from cgetent into one that
looks more like a terminfo entry and pass it through to the ncurses
terminfo parsing routines.  This also enables tic's -x flag.

@Update to ncurses-19991211:
 o treat as untranslatable to termcap those terminfo strings which
   contain non-decimal formatting, e.g., hexadecimal or octal.
 o correct commented-out capabilities that cannot be translated to
   termcap, which did not check if a colon must be escaped.
 o correct termcap translation for "%>" and "%+", which did not check
   if a colon must be escaped, for instance.
 o use save_string/save_char for _nc_captoinfo() to eliminate fixed
   buffer (originally for _nc_infotocap() in 960301 -TD).
 o correct expression used for terminfo equivalent of termcap %B,
   adjust regent100 entry which uses this.
 o some cleanup and commenting of ad hoc cases in _nc_infotocap().
 o eliminate a fixed-buffer in tic, used for translating comments.
 o add manpage for infotocap.
