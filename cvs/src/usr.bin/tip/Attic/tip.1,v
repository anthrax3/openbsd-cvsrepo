.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm tip
.Nd serial terminal emulator
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl nv
.Op Fl Ar speed
.Op Ar system-name
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is used to connect to another system over a serial link.
In the era before modern networks, it was typically used to
connect to a modem in order to dial in to a remote host.
It is now frequently used for tasks such as attaching to the
serial console of another machine for administrative or
debugging purposes.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width 4n
.It Fl n
No escape (disable tilde).
.It Fl v
Set verbose mode.
.El
.Pp
If
.Ar speed
is specified, it will override any baudrate specified in the system
description being used.
.Pp
If neither
.Ar speed
nor
.Ar system-name
are specified,
.Ar system-name
will be set to the value of the
.Ev HOST
environment variable.
.Pp
If
.Ar speed
is specified but
.Ar system-name
is not,
.Ar system-name
will be set to a value of 'tip' with
.Ar speed
appended.
For example,
.Ic tip -1200
will set
.Ar system-name
to 'tip1200'.
.Pp
Line access is logged to
.Pa /var/log/aculog .
This file does not exist by default and has to be created
to enable logging.
.Pp
Typed characters are normally transmitted directly to the remote
machine (which does the echoing as well).
A tilde
.Pq Ql ~
appearing as the first character of a line is an escape signal; the
following are recognized:
.Bl -tag -offset indent -width Fl
.It Ic ~^D No or Ic ~.
Drop the connection and exit.
Only the connection is dropped \(en the login session is not terminated.
.It Ic ~c Op Ar name
Change directory to
.Ar name
(no argument implies change to home directory).
.It Ic ~!
Escape to a shell (exiting the shell will return to
.Nm ) .
.It Ic ~\*(Gt
Copy file from local to remote.
.Nm
prompts for the name of a local file to transmit.
.It Ic ~\*(Lt
Copy file from remote to local.
.Nm
prompts first for the name of the file to be sent, then for a command
to be executed on the remote machine.
.It Ic ~p Ar from Op Ar to
Send a file to a remote
.Ux
host.
This command causes the remote
.Ux
system to run the following command string,
sending it the
.Sq from
file:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
stty -echo; cat \*(Gt 'to'; stty echo
.Ed
.Pp
If the
.Sq to
file isn't specified, the
.Sq from
file name is used.
This command is actually a
.Ux
specific version of the
.Ic ~\*(Gt
command.
.It Ic ~t Ar from Op Ar to
Take a file from a remote
.Ux
host.
As in the
.Ic ~p
command, the
.Sq to
file defaults to the
.Sq from
file name if it isn't specified.
The remote host executes the following command string
to send the file to
.Nm :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
cat 'from'; echo '' | tr '\e012' '\e01'
.Ed
.It Ic ~|
Pipe the output from a remote command to a local
.Ux
process.
The command string sent to the local
.Ux
system is processed by the shell.
.It Ic ~$
Pipe the output from a local
.Ux
process to the remote host.
The command string sent to the local
.Ux
system is processed by the shell.
.It Ic ~C
Fork a child process on the local system to perform special protocols
such as XMODEM.
The child program will be run with the following arrangement of
file descriptors:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
0 \*(Lt-\*(Gt remote tty in
1 \*(Lt-\*(Gt remote tty out
2 \*(Lt-\*(Gt local tty stderr
.Ed
.It Ic ~#
Send a
.Dv BREAK
to the remote system.
For systems which don't support the necessary
.Fn ioctl
call, the break is simulated by a sequence of line speed changes and
DEL characters.
.It Ic ~s
Set a variable (see the discussion below).
.It Ic ~v
List all variables and their values (if set).
.It Ic ~^Z
Stop
.Nm
(only available with job control).
.It Ic ~^Y
Stop only the
.Dq local side
of
.Nm
(only available with job control); the
.Dq remote side
of
.Nm ,
the side that displays output from the remote host, is left running.
.It Ic ~?
Get a summary of the tilde escapes.
.El
.Pp
To find the system description, and thus the operating characteristics
of
.Ar system-name ,
.Nm
searches for a system description with a name identical to
.Ar system-name .
The search order is
.Bl -enum -offset indent
.It
If the environment variable
.Ev REMOTE
does not start with a
.Ql /
it is assumed to be a system description, and is considered first.
.It
If the environment variable
.Ev REMOTE
begins with a
.Ql /
it is assumed to be a path to a
.Xr remote 5
database, and the specified database is searched.
.It
The default
.Xr remote 5
database,
.Pa /etc/remote ,
is searched.
.El
.Pp
See
.Xr remote 5
for full documentation on system descriptions.
.Pp
The
.Ar br
capability is used in system descriptions to specify the baud rate
with which to establish a connection.
If the value specified is not suitable, the baud rate to be used may
be given on the command line, e.g.\&
.Ql tip -300 mds .
.Pp
The
.Ar dv
capability is used to specify the device
with which to establish a connection.
For reasons outlined in
.Xr tty 4 ,
.Xr cua 4
devices should be used on architectures which have them.
For those which do not,
.Xr tty 4
devices can be used.
Users in group
.Dq dialer
are permitted to use
.Xr cua 4
devices by default;
permissions on
.Pa /dev/tty00
or
.Pa /dev/ttya
can be changed,
but they will revert to their defaults
after an upgrade or (re)install.
.Pp
When
.Nm
establishes a connection, it sends out the connection message
specified in the
.Ar cm
capability of the system description being used.
.Pp
When
.Nm
prompts for an argument, for example during setup of a file transfer, the
line typed may be edited with the standard erase and kill characters.
A null line in response to a prompt, or an interrupt, will abort the
dialogue and return the user to the remote machine.
.Pp
.Nm
guards against multiple users connecting to a remote system by opening
modems and terminal lines with exclusive access, and by honoring the
locking protocol used by
.Xr uucico .
.Pp
During file transfers
.Nm
provides a running count of the number of lines transferred.
When using the
.Ic ~\*(Gt
and
.Ic ~\*(Lt
commands, the
.Dq eofread
and
.Dq eofwrite
variables are used to recognize end-of-file when reading, and specify
end-of-file when writing (see below).
File transfers normally depend on hardwareflow or tandem mode for flow control.
If the remote system does not support hardwareflow or tandem mode,
.Dq echocheck
may be set to indicate
.Nm
should synchronize with the remote system on the echo of each
transmitted character.
.Ss VARIABLES
.Nm
maintains a set of variables which control its operation.
Some of these variables are read-only to normal users (root is allowed
to change anything of interest).
Variables may be displayed and set through the
.Sq s
escape.
The syntax for variables is patterned after
.Xr vi 1
and
.Xr Mail 1 .
Supplying
.Dq all
as an argument to the set command displays all variables readable by
the user.
Alternatively, the user may request display of a particular variable
by attaching a
.Ql \&?
to the end.
For example,
.Dq escape?
displays the current escape character.
.Pp
Variables are numeric, string, character, or boolean values.
Boolean variables are set merely by specifying their name; they may be
reset by prepending a
.Ql \&!
to the name.
Other variable types are set by concatenating an
.Ql =
and the value.
The entire assignment must not have any blanks in it.
A single set command may be used to interrogate as well as set a
number of variables.
Variables may be initialized at run time by placing set commands
(without the
.Ql ~s
prefix) in the initialization file
.Pa ~/.tiprc ;
the
.Fl v
option additionally causes
.Nm
to display the sets as they are made.
Certain common variables have abbreviations.
The following is a list of common variables, their abbreviations, and
their default values:
.Bl -tag -width Ar
.It Ar baudrate
(num) The baud rate at which the connection was established;

Remove untruths and beef up documentation for tip(1), remote(5) and
phones(5). In particular remove last reference to the 'cu' tip
interface since we use the 'cu' that comes with uucp, improve
documentation on phone numbers and flesh out documentation on
acu/modems supported. Document PHONES and REMOTE environment
variables.

Cleanup parsing of /etc/phones (so our example can be used) and ignore
lines with empty phone numbers instead of aborting the scan of the
file. This makes /etc/phones parsing consistant with ':pn:' capability
parsing. Don't try to dial empty phone numbers in either case.
