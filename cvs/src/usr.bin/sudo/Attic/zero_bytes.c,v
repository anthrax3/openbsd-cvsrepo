@Update to sudo 1.6.9p1.  Note that the environment handling in sudo
1.6.9 has changed relative to older versions.  Sudo now starts
commands with a minimal environment containing the variables in the
env_keep and env_check lists.  This behavior is configurable in the
sudoers file.  Please see the "SECURITY NOTES" section in the sudo
manual.

@Get rid of volatile variables that were a vain attempt to prevent the
compiler from optimizing away memset() calls.  Instead, add a new function,
zero_bytes(), to clear buffers with sensitive contents.
