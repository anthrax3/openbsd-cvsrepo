@More unifdef cleanup:
-UDIRED_XMAPS and -UFUND_XMAPS: you can't build mg the other way.
-DTIOCGWINSZ: you have this if you have term.h
Remove a #define TERMCAP which isn't being used.

Remove defines for NDIRED_XMAPS, NFUND_XMAPS, and IMAPEXT. They are all
defined to be 0 and are only ever used in addition. We don't need to add 0.
Simply lines that were using those defines.

@Clean up the includes in mg.
This does the following:
Moves all POSIX headers from sysdef.h into the individual .c files so that
each file now only includes what it needs. All headers are properly sorted.
Moves the remainder of sysdef.h to other files (mostly def.h) and deletes
sysdef.h now that it's no longer contains anything.
Tweak a comment that references sysdef.h so that it no longer does that.

@Add the notion of an "ephemeral" popup, so we can flag a window
for destruction at a later date. (in the process, add a window flag field)

This fixes an issue noted by maja: namely, the *completion*
window that pops up when you try to complete a filename on
buffer load would destroy any second window that you happened
to have open.
