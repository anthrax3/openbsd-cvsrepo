.Sh NAME
.Nm ltrace
.Nd shared library function call tracer
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm ltrace
.Op Fl ai
.Op Fl f Ar trfile
.Op Fl t Ar trstr
.Op Fl u Ar trspec
.Ar command
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm ltrace
enables shared library function calls issued by the specified processes
to be traced using the
.Xr utrace 2
user tracing facility.
By default, call trace data is logged to the file
.Pa ktrace.out ,
unless overridden by the
.Fl f
option.
Each function call is traced as a pair of
.Dv KTRFAC_USER
entries;
the first entry contains the shared library containing the symbol being
called, and the second entry contains the symbol name.
.Pp
Once tracing is enabled on a process, trace data will be logged until
either the process exits or the trace point is cleared with
.Xr ktrace 1 .
A traced process can generate enormous amounts of log data quickly;
it is strongly suggested that users memorize how to disable tracing before
attempting to trace a process.
The following command is sufficient to disable tracing on all user owned
processes and, if executed by root, all processes:
.Pp
.Dl $ ktrace -C
.Pp
The trace file is not human-readable; use
.Xr kdump 1
to decode it.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width 9n
.It Fl a
Append to the trace file instead of recreating it.
.It Fl f Ar trfile
Log trace records to
.Ar trfile
instead of
.Pa ktrace.out .
.It Fl i
Inherit; pass the trace flags to all future children of the designated
processes.
.It Fl t Ar trstr
The string argument represents the kernel trace points, one per letter.
The default is just
.Cm u .
The following table equates the letters with the trace points:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width flag -offset indent -compact
.It Cm c
trace system calls
.It Cm i
trace I/O
.It Cm n
trace namei translations
.It Cm p
trace violation of
.Xr pledge 2
restrictions
.It Cm s
trace signal processing
.It Cm t
trace various structures
.It Cm u
trace user data coming from
.Xr utrace 2
.It Cm x
trace argument vector in
.Xr execve 2
.It Cm X
trace environment in
.Xr execve 2
.It Cm +
trace the default points
.El
.It Fl u Ar trspec
Restrict the trace to a list of shared objects and/or function names, as
specified by the
.Ar trspec
argument.
The trace specification is a comma-separated list of library names,
followed by a colon
.Pq :\& ,
and a comma-separated list of function names.
Each list can be empty.
Each list member may end with a star
.Pq *
to only match the beginning of a name.
An exclamation mark at the beginning of a list turns it into a rejection list,
causing all unmatched names to be traced.
Library names are compared without their version number and
.Sq .so
suffix.
.It Ar command
Execute
.Ar command
with the specified trace flags.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width ktrace.outXXX -compact
.It Pa ktrace.out
Default

dump file.

.Sh EXAMPLES
Trace all shared library function calls from
.Xr wc 1
reading the message of the day:
.Dl $ ltrace wc -lh /etc/motd
.Pp
Trace only the shared library function calls in
.Pa libutil.so :
.Dl $ ltrace -u libutil wc -lh /etc/motd
.Pp
Trace all the shared library function calls but those in
.Pa libc.so :
.Dl $ ltrace -u \(dq!libc\(dq wc -lh /etc/motd
.Pp
Trace all the shared library function calls with names starting
.Qq fmt :
.Dl $ ltrace -u \(dq:fmt*\(dq wc -lh /etc/motd
.Pp
Trace all shared library function calls, as well as all system calls:
.Dl $ ltrace -t cu wc -lh /etc/motd

1.1
log
@Introduce ltrace(1). This tool works with ld.so to inject utrace record for
each plt call, allowing to trace a binary linked against shared library at the
public function call level.

To do so, ltrace(1) sets up some environment variables to enable plt tracing
in ld.so, and invokes ktrace(2) for utrace events. ld.so will force lazy
binding and will send an utrace record in the plt resolver, without updating
the plt.

Minimal filtering capabilities are provided, inspired by Solaris' truss -u,
to limit tracing to libraries and/or symbol names. Non-traced libraries and
symbols will have the regular resolver processing, with the expected plt
update.
