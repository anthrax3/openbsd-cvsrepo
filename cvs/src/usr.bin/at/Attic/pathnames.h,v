@Move atrun(8) functionality into cron(8) proper.  This fixes the
long-standing annoyance that atrun's granularity is 10 minutes.
Most at jobs run with a 1 minute granularity.  Jobs submitted via
"at now" or "batch" will run immediately.  Includes a rewritten
cron(8) man page.  at(1) will be integrated more closely into
cron at a future date.

Upgrading notes:
    the atrun job in root's crontab should be removed.
    the /var/at/spool directory is no longer used

@at(1) is no longer setuid root, it is setgid crontab.
This means that /var/at/at.{allow,deny} must be readable by group
crontab, /var/at/jobs is mode 01770, and /var/at/.SEQ is mode 0660.
