@The .Nd macro is intended to provide "a one line description", so avoid
multiple lines of input, in particular, don't use macros below .Nd;
such bad style can confuse various apropos(1) tools.  All deleted
macros reappear later in the text, anyway, except for .Tn, which i'm
deleting outright.
Found while scanning the tree for good and bad practices in preparation
for my EuroBSD2015 mdoc(7) tutorial on Oct 1 in Stockholm.

.Nm atq
.Nd display the at(1) job queue
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm atq
.Op Fl cnv
.Op Fl q Ar queue
.Op Ar name ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm atq
displays the queue of jobs, created by the
.Xr at 1
command, which are currently awaiting execution.
Unless the user is the superuser, only the user's own jobs will be displayed.
With no flags, the queue is sorted in the order that
the jobs will be executed.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width "-q queueX"
.It Fl c
Sort the queue by the time that the jobs were submitted (created).
By default,
.Nm
will sort the queue by the time that the jobs will run.
.It Fl n
Only print the total number of files that are currently in the queue.
.It Fl q Ar queue
Restrict output to jobs in the specified
.Ar queue .
A queue designation consists of a single letter.
Valid queue designations range from
.Sy a
to
.Sy z
and
.Sy A
to
.Sy Z .
The
.Sy c
queue is the default for
.Xr at 1
and the
.Sy E
queue for
.Xr batch 1 .
By default,
.Nm
will display jobs in all queues.
.It Fl v
Jobs that have completed but have not yet been removed are also displayed.
.El
.Pp
If a name(s) is provided, only those files belonging to that user(s) are
displayed.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /var/cron/atjobs -compact
.It Pa /var/cron/atjobs
directory containing job files

@Move contents of /var/at into /var/cron since at is now intergrated into
cron.  When ISC cron 5.0 is out the integration will be even tighter.

Also rename /var/cron/{allow,deny} -> /var/cron/cron.{allow,deny}
for consistency with POSIX and at.{allow,deny} and install an empty
cron.deny file (as we do at.deny) since crontab will require this
in the near future for POSIX compliance.

After a "make build" you can update your system as follows:
# mv /var/at/* /var/cron
# mv /var/cron/jobs /var/cron/atjobs
# mv /var/cron.allow /var/cron/cron.allow
# mv /var/cron.deny /var/cron/cron.deny
# rm -rf /var/at
# kill `cat /var/run/cron.pid` ; cron

1.1
log
@Major changes:

Job names are now "runtime.queue" where runtime is when the job will run
in Unix time format.  This is what SysV at does and allows us to nuke
the .SEQ file.

Historic BSD options for atq and atrm are now implemented;
atq and atrm get their own man pages.

At no longer does anything with the -v flag.  We print the execution
time when jobs are submitted so there is no need.

Most *scanf() usage is gone (one remains in atrun).

Better sanity checks in atrun.

Random style/cleanup.

With these changes we have the best of both worlds; POSIX compliance with
the traditional BSD features.
