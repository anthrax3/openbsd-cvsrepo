@The .Nd macro is intended to provide "a one line description", so avoid
multiple lines of input, in particular, don't use macros below .Nd;
such bad style can confuse various apropos(1) tools.  All deleted
macros reappear later in the text, anyway, except for .Tn, which i'm
deleting outright.
Found while scanning the tree for good and bad practices in preparation
for my EuroBSD2015 mdoc(7) tutorial on Oct 1 in Stockholm.

@Move contents of /var/at into /var/cron since at is now intergrated into
cron.  When ISC cron 5.0 is out the integration will be even tighter.

Also rename /var/cron/{allow,deny} -> /var/cron/cron.{allow,deny}
for consistency with POSIX and at.{allow,deny} and install an empty
cron.deny file (as we do at.deny) since crontab will require this
in the near future for POSIX compliance.

After a "make build" you can update your system as follows:
# mv /var/at/* /var/cron
# mv /var/cron/jobs /var/cron/atjobs
# mv /var/cron.allow /var/cron/cron.allow
# mv /var/cron.deny /var/cron/cron.deny
# rm -rf /var/at
# kill `cat /var/run/cron.pid` ; cron

1.1
log
@Major changes:

Job names are now "runtime.queue" where runtime is when the job will run
in Unix time format.  This is what SysV at does and allows us to nuke
the .SEQ file.

Historic BSD options for atq and atrm are now implemented;
atq and atrm get their own man pages.

At no longer does anything with the -v flag.  We print the execution
time when jobs are submitted so there is no need.

Most *scanf() usage is gone (one remains in atrun).

Better sanity checks in atrun.

Random style/cleanup.

With these changes we have the best of both worlds; POSIX compliance with
the traditional BSD features.
