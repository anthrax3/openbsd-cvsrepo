.Dt FUSER 1
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm fuser
.Nd identify process IDs holding specific files open
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl cfku
.Op Fl M Ar core
.Op Fl N Ar system
.Op Fl s Ar signal
.Ar
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility writes to standard output the process IDs of processes running
on the local system that have one or more of the named files open.
If
.Ar file
is a mounted block device, the output will show all processes having
files opened on that file system.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl c
The file is treated as a mount point and
.Nm
will report on any files open in the file system.
.It Fl f
Report only for the named file(s).
.It Fl k
Send the SIGKILL signal to each process.
.It Fl M Ar core
Extract values associated with the name list from the specified core
instead of the running kernel.
.It Fl N Ar system
Extract the name list from the specified system instead of the running kernel.
.It Fl s Ar signal
Send the specified
.Ar signal
to each process.
The
.Ar signal
may be specified as a signal number or as a symbolic name either with
or without the
.Dq SIG
prefix.
Signal names are not case sensitive.
For example, the following signal arguments are equivalent:
.Dq 9 ,
.Dq kill ,
.Dq SIGKILL .
.It Fl u
The username of the process using the file will be printed in brackets
to standard error.
If the username is unable to be determined, the real user ID will be printed
instead.
.El
.Pp
The
.Fl c
and
.Fl f
options are mutually exclusive.
.Pp
The name of the file followed by a colon
.Pq Sq \&:
is printed to standard error.
The following characters may be printed to standard error after the process ID
if the described conditions are true:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent -compact
.It c
The file is the process's current working directory.
.It r
The file is the process's root directory.
.It t
The file is the process's executable text.
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std fuser
.Sh EXAMPLES
Print the process IDs of any processes holding files open under the
.Ar /mnt
filesystem:
.Pp
.Dl $ fuser -c /mnt
.Pp
Send SIGTERM to any process holding a file open under the
.Ar /mnt
filesystem:
.Pp
.Dl # fuser -c -s term /mnt
.Pp
Report on all files opened under the filesystem on which
.Ar /dev/wd0a
is mounted:
.Pp
.Dl $ fuser /dev/wd0a
.Pp
Report on all processes currently holding
.Ar /dev/wd0a
open:
.Pp
.Dl $ fuser -f /dev/wd0a
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr fstat 1 ,
.Xr kill 1 ,
.Xr signal 3 ,
.Xr mount 8
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Nm
utility is compliant with the
X/Open System Interfaces option of the
.St -p1003.1-2008
specification.
.Pp
The flags
.Op Fl kMNs
are extensions to that specification.
