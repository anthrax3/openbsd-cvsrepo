.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm getent
.Nd get entries from administrative database
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Ar database
.Op Ar key ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
program retrieves and displays entries from the administrative
database specified by
.Ar database .
The order in which entries are looked up
is defined by the specific database
(for example, the lookup order for the
.Dq hosts
database is determined by
.Xr resolv.conf 5 ) .
The display format for a given
.Ar database
is as per the
.Dq traditional
file format for that database.
.Pp
.Ar database
may be one of:
.Bl -column "netgroup" -offset indent
.It Sy Database Ta Sy Display format
.It ethers Ta address name
.It group Ta group:passwd:gid:[member[,member]...]
.It hosts Ta address name [alias ...]
.It passwd Ta user:passwd:uid:gid:gecos:home_dir:shell
.It protocols Ta name protocol [alias ...]
.It rpc Ta name number [alias ...]
.It services Ta name port/protocol [alias ...]
.It shells Ta /path/to/shell
.El
.Pp
If one or more
.Ar key
arguments are provided, they will be looked up in
.Ar database
using the appropriate function.
For example,
.Cm passwd
supports a numeric UID or user name;
.Cm hosts
supports an IPv4 address, IPv6 address, or host name;
and
.Cm services
supports a service name, service name/protocol name, numeric port, or
numeric port/protocol name.
.Pp
If no
.Ar key
is provided and
.Ar database
supports enumeration, all entries for
.Ar database
will be retrieved using the appropriate enumeration function and printed.
.Sh EXIT STATUS
The
.Nm
utility exits with one of the following values:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent -compact
.It 0
Success.
.It 1
There was an error in the command syntax.
.It 2
One of the specified key names was not found in
.Ar database .
.It 3
There is no support for enumeration on
.Ar database .

.Sh HISTORY
A
.Nm
command first appeared in
.Ox 3.9 .
It was based on the command of the same name in
.Tn Solaris
and
.Tn Linux .

1.10
log
@as with other list types, column lists generally do not need a Pp/-compact
construct;

this also sidesteps what seems to be a problem with mandoc, in that
"-column -compact" seems to mess up the formatting. thus these pages should
now have their lists formatted nicely (i.e. correctly aligned and with indent
applied);

as a side note, the fact that headers are not properly marked up is another
issue which will be addressed separately (a mandoc fix is needed, i think).
i have fudged a few of these to mark up properly, since the workaround does
make sense for some pages.

as another side note, i haven;t fixed man7, as i need to prepare a separate
diff for kristaps and ingo.

log
@First pass at removing clauses 3 and 4 from NetBSD licenses.

Not sure what's more surprising: how long it took for NetBSD to
catch up to the rest of the BSDs (including UCB), or the amount of
code that NetBSD has claimed for itself without attributing to the
actual authors.
