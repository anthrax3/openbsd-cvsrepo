@Flense the telnet code base of unwanted ifdefs: authentication/encryption
tn3270, sgtty, pre-POSIX and other ancient system support, etc.  Brings up
to date the manpage with what we support.

@rcsid[] and sccsid[] and copyright[] are essentially unmaintained (and
unmaintainable).  these days, people use source.  these id's do not provide
any benefit, and do hurt the small install media
(the 33,000 line diff is essentially mechanical)

@Get rid of libtelnet, it is compiled into the tree programs
(telnetd, telnet and tn3270) that use them instead.
This gets rid of a really hairy dependency between telnet and libtelnet.
