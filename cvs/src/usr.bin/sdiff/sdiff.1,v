@Reduce usage of predefined strings in manpages.

Predefined strings are not very portable across troff implementations,
and they make the source much harder to read. Usually the intended
character can be written directly.

No output changes, except for two instances where the incorrect escape
was used in the first place.

displays two files side by side,
with any differences between the two highlighted as follows:
new lines are marked with
.Sq > ;
deleted lines are marked with
.Sq < ;
and changed lines are marked with
.Sq | .
.Pp
.Nm

prompting at each set of differences.
See the
.Fl o
option for an explanation.
.Pp
The options are:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl l
Only print the left column for identical lines.
.It Fl o Ar outfile

.Ar file1
and
.Ar file2

for details of which editor, if any, is invoked.
.Pp
The commands are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Cm l | 1
Choose left set of diffs.
.It Cm r | 2
Choose right set of diffs.
.It Cm s

.It Cm e
Start editing an empty file, which will be merged into
.Ar outfile
upon exiting the editor.
.It Cm e Cm l

.It Fl t

.Bl -tag -width Ds
