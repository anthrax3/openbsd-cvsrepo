1.9
log
@Some fairly major changes:
 o -N is implemented
 o -X is implemented
 o -x is implemented
 o diff.c has been rewritten and GNU long options are now supported
 o diffdir.c has been rewritten
    + no longer does fork + exec of /usr/bin/diff
    + can be called recursively (and will be for -r)
 o diff.h
    + don't include any .h files here any more, do it in the .c files
    + no Bell Labs code in this, gets a UCB copyright (the 32v sources
      only have a diff.c and there is nothing in common).
 o diffreg.c
    + most all remaining globals are now private to diffreg.c
    + files are only opened once
    + dynamically allocated objects are either freed or realloced
    + added missing UCB copyright (there were lots of UCB changes)
    + print correct thing when -s is specified
