.Sh NAME
.Nm wc
.Nd word, line, and byte or character count
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm wc
.Op Fl c | m
.Op Fl hlw
.Op Ar
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility reads one or more input text files and, by
default, writes the number of lines, words, and bytes
contained in each input file to the standard output.
If more than one input file is specified,
a line of cumulative count(s) for all named files is output on a
separate line following the last file count.
.Nm
considers a word to be a maximal string of characters delimited by
whitespace.
Whitespace characters are the set of characters for which the
.Xr isspace 3
function returns true.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl c
The number of bytes in each input file
is written to the standard output.
.It Fl h
Use unit suffixes: Byte, Kilobyte, Megabyte, Gigabyte, Terabyte,
Petabyte, and Exabyte in order to reduce the number of digits to four or fewer
using powers of 2 for sizes (K=1024, M=1048576, etc.).
.It Fl l
The number of lines in each input file
is written to the standard output.
.It Fl m
Count characters instead of bytes, and use
.Xr iswspace 3
instead of
.Xr isspace 3 .
.It Fl w
The number of words in each input file
is written to the standard output.
.El
.Pp
When an option is specified,
.Nm
only reports the information requested by that option.
The default action is equivalent to the flags
.Fl clw
having been specified.
.Pp
If no file names are specified, the standard input is used
and a file name is not output.
The resulting output is one
line of the requested count(s) with the cumulative sum
of all files read in via standard input.
.Pp
By default, the standard output contains a line for each
input file of the form:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
lines	 words	bytes	file_name
.Ed
.Pp
The counts for lines, words, and bytes
.Pq or characters
are integers separated by spaces.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width LC_CTYPE
.It Ev LC_CTYPE
The character encoding
.Xr locale 1 .
It decides which byte sequences form characters.
If unset or set to
.Qq C ,
.Qq POSIX ,
or an unsupported value,
.Fl m
has the same effect as
.Fl c .
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std wc
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr isspace 3
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Nm
utility is compliant with the
.St -p1003.1-2008
specification.
.Pp
The flag
.Op Fl h
is an extension to that specification.
.Sh HISTORY
A
.Nm
utility appeared in
.At v1 .

@Back in January, Kaspars at Bankovskis dot net reported that the wc(1)
manual claims that -m would count characters, while our version of the

nobody stood up to fix the code, sync the docs with reality for now.

.Pp
Historically, the
.Nm
utility was documented to define a word as a ``maximal string of
characters delimited by
.Aq space ,
.Aq tab
or
.Aq newline
characters''.
The implementation, however, didn't handle non-printing characters
correctly so that ``  ^D^E  '' counted as 6 spaces, while ``foo^D^Ebar''
counted as 8 characters.
4BSD systems after 4.3BSD modified the implementation to be consistent
with the documentation.
This implementation defines a
.Dq word
in terms of the
.Xr isspace 3
function, as required by
.St -p1003.2-92 .
