1.1.1.1
log
@Initial import of vim 4.2.

This is meant to replace nvi in the tree.  Vim, in general, works better,
provides more features, and does not suffer from the license problems
being imposed upon nvi.

On the other hand, vim lacks a non-visual ex mode, in addition to open mode.

This includes the GUI (X11) code, but doesn't try to compile it.
