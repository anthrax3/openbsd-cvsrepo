@*vim_mac.txt*   For Vim version 3.0.  Last modification: 1996 May 22

There was a Mac port for version 3.0 of Vim.  Unfortunately 4.0 has not been
ported yet.  I hope it will be available at a later time.  This file will be
included then.  Here are the first few lines from the old file:

1.1.1.1
log
@Initial import of vim 4.2.

This is meant to replace nvi in the tree.  Vim, in general, works better,
provides more features, and does not suffer from the license problems
being imposed upon nvi.

On the other hand, vim lacks a non-visual ex mode, in addition to open mode.

This includes the GUI (X11) code, but doesn't try to compile it.
