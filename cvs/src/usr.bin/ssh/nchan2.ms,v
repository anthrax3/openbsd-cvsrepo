Notes
.PP
The input buffer is filled with data from the socket
(the socket represents the local consumer/producer of the
forwarded channel).
The data is then sent over the INPUT-end (transmit-end) of the channel to the
remote peer.
Data sent by the peer is received on the OUTPUT-end (receive-end),
saved in the output buffer and written to the socket.
.PP
If the local protocol instance has forwarded all data on the
INPUT-end of the channel, it sends an EOF message to the peer.
.PP
A CLOSE message is sent to the peer if
both the INPUT- and the OUTOUT-half of the local
end of the channel are closed.
.PP
The channel can be deallocated by a protocol instance
if a CLOSE message he been both sent and received.
