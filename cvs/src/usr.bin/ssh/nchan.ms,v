Notes
.PP
The input buffer is filled with data from the socket
(the socket represents the local consumer/producer of the
forwarded channel).
The data is then sent over the INPUT-end (transmit-end) of the channel to the
remote peer.
Data sent by the peer is received on the OUTPUT-end (receive-end),
saved in the output buffer and written to the socket.
.PP
If the local protocol instance has forwarded all data on the
INPUT-end of the channel, it sends an IEOF message to the peer.
If the peer receives the IEOF and has consumed all
data he replies with an OCLOSE.
When the local instance receives the OCLOSE
he considers the INPUT-half of the channel closed.
The peer has his OUTOUT-half closed.
.PP
A channel can be deallocated by a protocol instance
if both the INPUT- and the OUTOUT-half on his
side of the channel are closed.
Note that when an instance is unable to consume the
received data, he is permitted to send an OCLOSE
before the matching IEOF is received.
