@i bet a lot of people didn't know what ssh 1.2.16 had a nice license.
well, except for the patent issues.  someone in sweden (forget their
name at the moment) cleaned out most of the patented code, and now
this code removes rsa code.  when this is done, it will link against
libssl, but the work isn't completely done yet.  then we need to bring
this up to modern days, featurewise.
