@cleanup copyright notices on all files.  I have attempted to be accurate with
the details.  everything is now under Tatu's licence (which I copied from his
readme), and/or the core-sdi bsd-ish thing for deattack, or various openbsd
developers under a 2-term bsd licence.  We're not changing any rules, just
being accurate.

COPYING POLICY AND OTHER LEGAL ISSUES

As far as I am concerned, the code I have written for this software
can be used freely for any purpose.  Any derived versions of this
software must be clearly marked as such, and if the derived work is
incompatible with the protocol description in the RFC file, it must be
called by a name other than "ssh" or "Secure Shell".

However, I am not implying to give any licenses to any patents or
copyrights held by third parties, and the software includes parts that
are not under my direct control.  As far as I know, all included
source code is used in accordance with the relevant license agreements
and can be used freely for any purpose (the GNU license being the most
restrictive); see below for details.

[ RSA is no longer included. ]
[ IDEA is no longer included. ]
[ DES is now external. ]
[ GMP is now external. No more GNU licence. ]
[ Zlib is now external. ]
[ The make-ssh-known-hosts script is no longer included. ]
[ TSS has been removed. ]
[ MD5 is now external. ]
[ RC4 support has been removed. ]
[ Blowfish is now external. ]

The 32-bit CRC implementation in crc32.c is due to Gary S. Brown.
Comments in the file indicate it may be used for any purpose without
restrictions.

The 32-bit CRC compensation attack detector in deattack.c was
contributed by CORE SDI S.A. under a BSD-style license. See
http://www.core-sdi.com/english/ssh/ for details.

Note that any information and cryptographic algorithms used in this
software are publicly available on the Internet and at any major
bookstore, scientific library, and patent office worldwide.  More
information can be found e.g. at "http://www.cs.hut.fi/crypto".

The legal status of this program is some combination of all these
permissions and restrictions.  Use only at your own responsibility.
You will be responsible for any legal consequences yourself; I am not
making any claims whether possessing or using this is legal or not in
your country, and I am not taking any responsibility on your behalf.


			    NO WARRANTY

BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

@i bet a lot of people didn't know what ssh 1.2.16 had a nice license.
well, except for the patent issues.  someone in sweden (forget their
name at the moment) cleaned out most of the patented code, and now
this code removes rsa code.  when this is done, it will link against
libssl, but the work isn't completely done yet.  then we need to bring
this up to modern days, featurewise.

The RSA algorithm and even the concept of public key encryption are
claimed to patented in the United States.  These patents may interfere
with your right to use this software.  It is possible to compile the
software using the RSAREF2 library by giving --with-rsaref on the
configure command line.  This may or may not make it legal to use this
software for non-commercial purposes in the United States (I have sent
a query about this to RSADSI (on July 10, 1995), but have not received
an answer yet).  The RSAREF2 distribution is not included in this
distribution, but can be obtained from almost any ftp site worldwide
containing cryptographic materials.  Using RSAREF is not recommended
outside the United States.  See "http://www.cs.hut.fi/crypto" if you
have trouble finding the RSAREF library.

[ IDEA is now *only* included if configured with --with-idea. ]
The IDEA algorithm is claimed to be patented in the United States and
several other countries.  I have been told by Ascom-Tech (the patent
holder) that IDEA can be used freely for non-commercial use.  A copy
of their letter is at the end.  The software can be compiled without
IDEA by specifying the --without-idea option on the configure command
line.

[ All these files are now external to the distribution. ]
The DES implementation in this distribution is derived from the libdes
library by Eric Young <eay@@mincom.oz.au>.  It can be used under the
Gnu General Public License (libdes-COPYING) or the Artistic License
(libdes-ARTISTIC), at your option.  See libdes-README for more
information.  Eric Young has kindly given permission to distribute the
derived version under these terms.  The file crypt.c is fcrypt.c from
SSLeay-0.4.3a by Eric Young; he permits free use.

[ GMP is no longer part of the distribution. ]
The GNU Multiple Precision Library, included in this release and
linked into the executable, is distributed under the GNU General
Public License.  A copy can be found in gmp-1.3.2/COPYING.

[ Zlib is no longer part of the distribution. ]
The zlib compression library is copyright Jean-loup Gailly and Mark
Adler.  Anyone is permitted to use the library for any purpose.  A
copy of the license conditions can be found in zlib095/README.

[ This script is no longer part of the distribution. ]
The make-ssh-known-hosts script was contributed by Tero Kivinen
<kivinen@@niksula.hut.fi> and is distributed under the GNU General
Public License.  A copy can be found in gnu-COPYING-GPL.

Some files, such as memmove.c and random.c, are owned by the Regents
of the University of California, and can be freely used and
distributed.  License terms are included in the affected files.  The
file scp.c is derived from code owned by the Regents of the University
of California, and can be used freely.

[ TSS has been removed from the distribution. ]
The TSS encryption algorithm implementation in tss.c is copyright Timo
Rinne <tri@@iki.fi> and Cirion Oy.  It is used with permission, and
permission has been given for anyone to use it for any purpose as part
of ssh.

In some countries, particularly France, Russia, Iraq, and Pakistan, it
may be illegal to use any encryption at all without a special permit,
and the rumor is that you cannot get a permit for any strong
encryption.

If you are in the United States, you should be aware that while this
software was written outside the United States using information
publicly available everywhere, the United States Government may
consider it a criminal offence to export this software from the United
States once it has been imported.  I have been told that "the federal
mandatory sentencing guidelines for this offence are 41 to 51 months
in federal prison".  The rumor is that the government considers
putting the software available on an ftp site the same as exporting
it.  Contact the Office of Defence Trade Controls if you need more
information.  Also, please write to your congress and senate
representatives to get these silly and unconstitutional restrictions
dropped.

Below is a copy of a message I received from Ascom, the holder of the IDEA
patent.

From: IDEA@@ascom.ch (Licensing Systec)
Encoding: 3001 Text
To: ylo@@cs.hut.fi
Subject: Phone Call 15.8.95

     Dear Mr. Ylonen
     
     Thank you for your inquiry about the IDEA encryption algorithm. 
     Please excuse the delay in answering your fax sent 26.6.95. 
     Here is the information you requested :
     
     Non commercial use of IDEA is free. The following examples (regarding 
     PGP) should clarify what we mean by commercial and non-commercial use
     
     Here are some examples of commercial use of PGP:
     
     1. When PGP is used for signing and/or encrypting e-mail messages 
     exchanged between two corporations.
     
     2. When a consultant uses PGP for his communications with his client 
     corporations.
     
     3. When a bank makes PGP available to its clients for telebanking and 
     charges them money for it (directly or indirectly).
     
     4. When you use the software you receive from a company for commercial 
     purposes (telebanking included).
     
     
     Some examples of non commercial use:
     
     1. When an individual uses PGP for his private communications.
     
     2. When an individual obtains PGP on the Internet and uses it for 
     telebanking (assuming this is approved by the bank).
     
     3. When you use the software you receive from a company for private 
     purposes (telebanking excluded).
     
     
     You may use IDEA freely within your software for non commercial use. 
     If you include IDEA in your software, it must include the following  
     copy right statement :
     
     1. Copyright and Licensing Statement
        IDEA(tm) is a trademark of Ascom Systec AG. There is no license fee 
        required for non-commercial use. Commercial users of IDEA may       
        obtain licensing information from Ascom Systec AG.  
        e-mail: IDEA@@ascom.ch
        fax: ++41 64 56 59 54
     
     
     For selling the software commercially a product license is required:
     
     The PRODUCT LICENSE gives a software developer the right to implement 
     IDEA in a software product and to sell this product worldwide. With 
     the PRODUCT LICENSE we supply a source listing in C and a software 
     manual. We charge an initial fee per company and a percentage of sales 
     of the software product or products (typically between .5 and 4 per 
     cent of the sales price, depending on the price and the importance of 
     IDEA for the product).
     
     
     For further information please do not hesitate to contact us.
     
     Best regards,
     
     Roland Weinhart
