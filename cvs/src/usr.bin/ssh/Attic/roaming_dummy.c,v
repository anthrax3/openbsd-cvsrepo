@update packet.c & isolate, introduce struct ssh
a) switch packet.c to buffer api and isolate per-connection info into struct ssh
b) (de)serialization of the state is moved from monitor to packet.c
c) the old packet.c API is implemented in opacket.[ch]
d) compress.c/h is removed and integrated into packet.c
