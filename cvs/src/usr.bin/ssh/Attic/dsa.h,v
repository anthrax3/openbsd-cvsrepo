@add support for RSA to SSH2.  please test.

there are now 3 types of keys: RSA1 is used by ssh-1 only,
RSA and DSA are used by SSH2.

you can use 'ssh-keygen -t rsa -f ssh2_rsa_file' to generate RSA
keys for SSH2 and use the RSA keys for hostkeys or for user keys.

SSH2 RSA or DSA keys are added to .ssh/authorised_keys2 as before.

IdentityFile2, HostDsaKey and DSAAuthentication are obsolete.
you can use multiple IdentityFile and HostKey for all types of keys.

the option DSAAuthentication is replaced by PubkeyAuthetication.

@cleanup copyright notices on all files.  I have attempted to be accurate with
the details.  everything is now under Tatu's licence (which I copied from his
readme), and/or the core-sdi bsd-ish thing for deattack, or various openbsd
developers under a 2-term bsd licence.  We're not changing any rules, just
being accurate.

@add DSA pubkey auth and other SSH2 fixes.  use ssh-keygen -[xX]
