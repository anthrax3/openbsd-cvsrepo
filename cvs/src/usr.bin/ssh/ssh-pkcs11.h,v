log
@replace our obsolete smartcard code with PKCS#11.
	ftp://ftp.rsasecurity.com/pub/pkcs/pkcs-11/v2-20/pkcs-11v2-20.pdf
ssh(1) and ssh-keygen(1) use dlopen(3) directly to talk to a PKCS#11
provider (shared library) while ssh-agent(1) delegates PKCS#11 to
a forked a ssh-pkcs11-helper process.
PKCS#11 is currently a compile time option.
feedback and ok djm@@; inspired by patches from Alon Bar-Lev
