log
@Fix a couple of issues in Russian calendar entries:

  * Fix #ifndef safeguards (rename/add where missing);
  * Use consistent spelling for year when it's mentioned in day desc;
  * Tweak some wrong casing cases;
  * Remove calendar.msk since Moscow doesn't have summer time anymore,
    and that was the only thing this file was about;
  * A few other corrections.

Some corrections from Mikhail on tech@@, thanks!
Small fix & okay from mikeb@@.
