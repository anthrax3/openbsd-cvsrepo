@From NetBSD: clear up the Pioneer 10 entry.  While I'm at it, I've moved
fictional events (mainly from Lord of the Rings) to calendar.fictional,
removed a few events which don't really correspond to a specific date,
and fixed a few duplicates and such.  This file has still not been
fact-checked, though.
