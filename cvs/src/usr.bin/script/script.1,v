@Document what remains of the 2BSD heritage.
All facts found on the CSRG CD 1 in the 2bsd directory.
Feedback and ok jmc@@, ok sobrado@@.

Note the large number of 3BSD -> 2BSD changes.
Kirk McKusick asked Cynthia Livingston (cael@@, of USENIX, who converted
most manuals from man(7) to mdoc(7) for the 4.3BSD-Net/2 release and
added lots of historical information around that time) what happened
in this respect, and she answered that she often wrote "appeared
in 3BSD" when she was unsure of when a utility was added.
Thanks to Kirk and Cynthia for that clarification.

.Dt SCRIPT 1
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm script
.Nd make typescript of terminal session
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm script
.Op Fl a
.Op Ar file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
makes a typescript of everything printed on your terminal.
It is useful for students who need a hardcopy record of an interactive
session as proof of an assignment, as the typescript file
can be printed out later with
.Xr lpr 1 .
.Pp
If the argument
.Ar file
is given,
.Nm
saves all dialogue in
.Ar file .
If no file name is given, the typescript is saved in the file
.Pa typescript .
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a
Append the output to
.Ar file
or
.Pa typescript ,
retaining the prior contents.
.El
.Pp
The script ends when the forked shell exits (a control-D
.Pq Ql ^D
to exit
the Bourne shell
.Pf ( Xr sh 1 ) ,
and
.Ic exit ,
.Ic logout ,
or control-D
(if
.Va ignoreeof
is not set) for the
C-shell,
.Xr csh 1 ) .
.Nm
will exit with the status of 0 unless any of its child
processes fail.
In which case,
.Nm
will return 1.
.Pp
Certain interactive commands, such as
.Xr vi 1 ,
create garbage in the typescript file.
.Nm
works best with commands that do not manipulate the
screen; the results are meant to emulate a hardcopy terminal.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width SHELL
.It Ev SHELL
Name of the shell to be forked by
.Nm script .
If not set, the Bourne shell is assumed.
(Most shells set this variable automatically.)
.El
.Sh HISTORY
A predecessor called
.Nm dribble
appeared in
.Bx 2 .
The
.Nm
command first appeared in
.Bx 3 .
.Sh AUTHORS
.An Mark Horton .
.Sh BUGS
.Nm
places
.Em everything
in the log file, including linefeeds and backspaces.
This is not what the naive user expects.
