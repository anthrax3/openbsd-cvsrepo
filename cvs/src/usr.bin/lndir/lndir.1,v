.Sh NAME
.Nm lndir
.Nd create a shadow directory of symbolic links to another directory tree
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm lndir
.Op Fl is
.Op Fl e Ar exceptfile
.Ar fromdir
.Op Ar todir
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
program makes a shadow copy
.Ar todir
of a directory tree
.Ar fromdir ,
except that the shadow is not
populated with real files but instead with symbolic links pointing at
the real files in the
.Ar fromdir
directory tree.
This is usually useful for maintaining source code for
different machine architectures.
You create a shadow directory
containing links to the real source, which you will have usually
mounted from a remote machine.
You can build in the shadow tree, and
the object files will be in the shadow directory, while the
source files in the shadow directory are just symlinks to the real
files.
.Pp
This scheme has the advantage that if you update the source, you need not
propagate the change to the other architectures by hand, since all
source in all shadow directories are symlinks to the real thing:
just change working directory to the shadow directory and recompile away.
.Pp
The
.Ar todir
argument is optional and defaults to the current directory.
The
.Ar fromdir
argument may be relative (e.g.\&
.Pa ../src )
and is relative to
.Ar todir
(not the current directory).
.Pp
If you add files, simply run
.Nm
again.
New files will be silently added.
Old files will be
checked that they have the correct link.
.Pp
Deleting files is a more painful problem; the symlinks will
just point into never never land.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl e Ar exceptfile
Add the specified file to the list of excluded files/directories.
This is effective in all directories searched by
.Nm .
This option may be specified as many times as needed.
.Pp
The following types of files are excluded by default:
.Pp
.Bl -dash -offset indent -compact
.It
files whose names end in
.Sq ~
.It
files whose names start with
.Sq .#
.It
RCS, SCCS, CVS, and CVS.adm directories
.El
.It Fl i
If a file in
.Ar fromdir
is a symbolic link,
.Nm
will make the same link in
.Ar todir
rather than making a link back to the (symbolic link) entry in
.Ar fromdir .
The
.Fl i
flag changes that behavior,
i.e. it causes the program to not treat symbolic links in
.Ar fromdir
specially.
The link created in
.Ar todir
will point back to the corresponding (symbolic link) file in
.Ar fromdir .
If the link is to a directory, this is almost certainly the wrong thing.
.Pp
This option exists mostly to emulate the behavior the C version of
.Nm
had in X11R6.
Its use is not recommended.
.It Fl s
Suppresses status messages normally output as
.Nm
descends into each subdirectory.
.El
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
The program displays the name of each subdirectory it enters, followed
by a colon.
The
.Fl s
option suppresses these messages.
.Pp
A warning message is displayed if the symbolic link cannot be created.
The usual problem is that a regular file of the same name already
exists.
.Pp
If the link already exists but doesn't point to the correct file, the
program prints the link name and the location where it does point.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr find 1 ,
.Xr ln 1 ,
.Xr patch 1
.Sh HISTORY
.Nm
was first distributed as part of X11.
.Pp
This version first appeared in
.Ox 1.2 .
.Sh BUGS
The
.Xr patch 1
program gets upset if it cannot change the files.
You should never run
.Xr patch 1
from a shadow directory anyway.
.Pp
To clear out all files before you can relink
(if
.Ar fromdir
moved, for instance):
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ find todir -type l -print0 | xargs -0 -r rm
.Ed
.Pp
Find all files that are not directories:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ find . ! -type d -print0
.Ed

@providing MLINKS for shell builtins makes little sense: what we had was out
of date for ever (no ksh builtins), and since we have two shells, pointing
to one page or the other is never going to work; so remove MLINKS for
csh(1); the cd(1) and wait(1) pages (also builtins); and update any trailing
Xr's;

please, there are tools like whence, man, and locate for finding this stuff;

If a file in \fIfromdir\fP is a symbolic link, \fIlndir\fP will make
the same link in \fItodir\fP rather than making a link back to the
(symbolic link) entry in \fIfromdir.\fP  The \fB\-i\fP flag
changes this behavior.
.SH OPTIONS

effective in all directories searched by \fIlndir\fP.  This option may be
specified as many times as needed.
.IP \-s
Normally \fIlndir\fP outputs the name of each subdirectory as it
descends into it.  The \fB\-s\fP option suppresses these status
messages.
.IP \-i
Causes the program to not treat symbolic links in \fIfromdir\fP
specially.  The link created in \fItodir\fP will point back to the
corresponding (symbolic link) file in \fIfromdir\fP.

You need to use something like
.nf
	find todir \|\-type l \|\-print \||\| xargs rm
.fi
to clear out all files before you can relink (if fromdir moved, for instance).
Something like
.nf
	 find . \|\\! \|\-type d \|\-print
.fi
will find all files that are not directories.
