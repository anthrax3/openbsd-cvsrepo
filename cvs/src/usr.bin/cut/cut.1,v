.Sh NAME
.Nm cut
.Nd select portions of each line of a file
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm cut
.Fl b Ar list
.Op Fl n
.Op Ar
.Nm cut
.Fl c Ar list
.Op Ar
.Nm cut
.Fl f Ar list
.Op Fl s
.Op Fl d Ar delim
.Op Ar
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility selects portions of each line (as specified by
.Ar list )
from each
.Ar file
and writes them to the standard output.
If no
.Ar file
arguments are specified, or a file argument is a single dash
.Pq Sq \- ,
.Nm
reads from the standard input.
The items specified by
.Ar list
can be in terms of column position or in terms of fields delimited
by a special character.
Column and field numbering starts from 1;
output is in the same order as input, not in the order selected.
.Pp
.Ar list
is a comma or whitespace separated set of numbers and/or
number ranges.
Number ranges consist of a number, a dash
.Pq Sq \- ,
and a second number
which select the fields or columns from the first number to the second,
inclusive.
Numbers or number ranges may be preceded by a dash, which selects all
fields or columns from 1 to the first number.
Numbers or number ranges may be followed by a dash, which selects all
fields or columns from the last number to the end of the line.
Numbers and number ranges may be repeated, overlapping, and in any order.
It is not an error to select fields or columns not present in the
input line.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl b Ar list
The
.Ar list
specifies byte positions.
.It Fl c Ar list
The
.Ar list
specifies character positions.
.It Fl d Ar delim
Use the first character of
.Ar delim
as the field delimiter character.
The default is the
.Aq TAB
character.
.It Fl f Ar list
The
.Ar list
specifies fields, separated by the field delimiter character.
The selected fields are output,
separated by the field delimiter character.
.It Fl n
Do not split multi-byte characters.
A character is written to standard output if and only if the byte
position holding its last byte is selected.
.It Fl s
Suppresses lines with no field delimiter characters.
Unless specified, lines with no delimiters are passed through unmodified.
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width LC_CTYPE
.It Ev LC_CTYPE
The character encoding
.Xr locale 1 .
It decides which byte sequences form characters.
If unset or set to
.Qq C ,
.Qq POSIX ,
or an unsupported value,
.Fl c
does the same as
.Fl b ,
.Fl n
has no effect, and
.Fl d
uses the first byte of
.Ar delim .
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
The
.Nm
utility exits 0 if all input files are output successfully,
and >0 if an error occurs.
.Sh EXAMPLES
Extract login names and shells from the system
.Xr passwd 5
file as
.Dq name:shell
pairs:
.Pp
.Dl "$ cut -d : -f 1,7 /etc/passwd"
.Pp
Show the names and login times of logged in users:
.Pp
.Dl "$ who | cut -c 1-8,18-30"
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr awk 1 ,
.Xr paste 1
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Nm
utility is compliant with the
.St -p1003.1-2008
specification.

@improve POSIX compliance by continuing to process the remaining file
operands after not finding an input file.

from the IEEE Std 1003.1-2008 (``POSIX.1'') rationale:

    "Unlike other utilities, some historical implementations of cut
     exit after not finding an input file, rather than continuing to
     process the remaining file operands.  This behavior is prohibited
     by this volume of POSIX.1-2008, where only the exit status is
     affected by this problem."
