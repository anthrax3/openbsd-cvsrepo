1.1
log
@UTF-8 support: In a UTF-8 locale, properly align columns in the
presence of zero-width and double-width characters and replace
non-printable codepoints and invalid bytes with ASCII question
marks.  No change in the C/POSIX locale.
As a side effect, get rid of all pointer to pointer variables
and simplify some of the code.

Partially based on ideas from tedu@@.
Feedback and OK czarkoff@@, OK tedu@@.
