## web relay -- a degenerate version of webproxy, usable with browsers that
## don't understand proxies.  This just forwards connections to a given server.
## No query logging, no access control [although you can add it to XNC for
## your own run], and full-URL links will undoubtedly confuse the browser
## if it can't reach the server directly.  This was actually written before
## the full proxy was, and it shows.
## The arguments in this case are the destination server and optional port.
## Please flame pinheads who use self-referential absolute links.

# set these as you wish: proxy port...
PORT=8000
# any extra args to the listening "nc", for instance "-s inside-net-addr"
XNC=''

# functionality switch, which has to be done fast to start the next listener

@nc is *hobbit*'s netcat; let the sysadm have the same tools the crackers
have, so that he may learn what the network is about and protect it better.
