log
@tzfile.h is an internal header that should never have been installed.
What's worse, the tzfile.h that gets installed is over 20 years old
and doesn't match the real tzfile.h in libc/time.  This makes the
tree safe for /usr/include/tzfile.h removal.  The TM_YEAR_BASE
define has been moved to time.h temporarily until its usage is
replaced by 1900 in the tree.  Actual removal of tzfile.h is pending
a ports build.  Based on a diff from deraadt@@

@Make some $OpenBSD$ lines prettier/standardier by eliminating
superflous '*' after '/*' and adding blank after terminating '$'.
Also eases parsing of the lines by simple awk scripts.

Aesthetic approval from tedu@@.
