.Dt NOHUP 1
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm nohup
.Nd invoke a command immune to hangups
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm nohup
.Ar utility
.Op Ar arg ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command allows the specified utility to be protected from termination
if the user should become logged out
(for example, due to a modem line or TCP/IP connection being dropped).
To do this,
.Nm
sets the
.Dv SIGHUP
.Xr signal 3
.Pq Dq terminal line hangup
to be ignored,
then executes
.Ar utility
along with any arguments.
.Pp
If the standard output is a terminal, the standard output is
appended to the file
.Pa nohup.out
in the current directory.
If standard error is a terminal, it is directed to the same place
as the standard output.
.Pp
If the output file
.Pa nohup.out
cannot be created in the current directory,
.Nm
attempts to create the file in the user's home directory.
If the file
.Pa nohup.out
cannot be created,
either in the current directory or the user's home directory,
.Nm
will exit without invoking
.Ar utility ,
with an exit value as described below.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ev HOME
User's home directory.
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
The
.Nm
utility exits with one of the following values:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent -compact
.It 126
The
.Ar utility
was found but could not be invoked.
.It 127
The
.Ar utility
could not be found or an error occurred in
.Nm .
.El
.Pp
Otherwise, the exit status of
.Nm
shall be that of
.Ar utility .
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr csh 1 ,
.Xr signal 3
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Nm
utility is compliant with the
.St -p1003.1-2008
specification.
.Pp
.Nm
also exists as a built-in to
.Xr csh 1 ,
though with a different syntax.

@i saw the previous was wrong as soon as i committed it: put the
built-in blurb in STANDARDS; we did once have a COMPATIBILITY section
which we merged with STANDARDS, so i think this is appropriate. it
certainly feels better than adding single sentences randomly to the
end of text bodies.
