@Simplify: write HTTP 303 redirects with relative locations.
Suggested by bentley@@.

Delete the HTTP_HOST configuration variable that is now obsolete.

@Make the SCRIPT_NAME logic simpler, safer, and make it actually work;
in part based on ideas by bentley@@.
While here, improve the documentation.

@Use include files "header.html" and "footer.html" rather than a
compiled-in string.  This is not a security risk, we read the file
manpath.conf from the same directory, anyway.  No error handling
is needed; even if the files are absent, that's not an error.

This is more flexible without causing complication of the code or
the user interface.  It helps the upcoming revamp of the online
manual pages on man.NetBSD.org.

Based on an idea by Jean-Yves Migeon <jeanyves dot migeon at free dot fr>,
but implemented in a much simpler way.

log
@Kristaps points out that the current HTTP/1.1 draft standard (RFC
2616) requires the Location: response-header field to be an absolute
URI (14.30), and only the most recent proposed standard (RFC 7231),
which is barely a month old, allows a relative Location: (7.1.2).
While most modern browsers appear to support relative Location:
headers, some may not, and it's maybe a bit early to rely on relative
Location: headers.

I'm not going back to the HTTP_HOST or SERVER_NAME CGI variables,
though.  While some CGI programs certainly require those, in which
case both the CGI programmer and the web server admin have to be
very careful to keep the system secure and reliable, man.cgi(8)
does not really need them.  We always know at compile time which
domain we are running for, and for man.cgi(8), security and reliability
are definitely much more important than flexibility.  So make HTTP_HOST
a compile-time definition for now.

@Compatibility hack for the old "manpath=OpenBSD<blank>" query parameter format;
unfortunate, more than 400 links needing this are scattered all around
the www.openbsd.org website, and CVSweb needs this as well.
