1.3
log
@Merge release 1.10.4 (all code by kristaps@@), providing four new features:
1) Proper .Bk support: allow output line breaks at input line breaks,
but keep input lines together in the output, finally fixing
synopses like aucat(1), mail(1) and tmux(1).
2) Mostly finished -Tps (PostScript) output.
3) Implement -Thtml output for .Nm blocks and .Bk -words.
4) Allow iterative interpolation of user-defined roff(7) strings.
Also contains some minor bugfixes and some performance improvements.

@Rudimentary implementation of user-defined strings;
no time for more refinement right now.
In particular, fixes terminfo(3) and mdoc.samples(7).
ok kristaps@@, who will add the HTML frontend bits
