@Resync to bsd.lv, most code from kristaps@@.
In particular, support the MANPATH environment variable
and don't confuse index record numbers when working with
multiple mandoc databases at once.
Besides, remove lots of gratuitious code and whitespace differences.

log
@Minimal man.conf(5) _whatdb support for mandocdb(8) and apropos(1),
and add the standard options -M and -m to apropos(1).
Including a bugfix to prevent mandocdb(8) from leaking
database file descriptors.
