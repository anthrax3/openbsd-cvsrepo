.Sh NAME
.Nm whatis
.Nd describe what a command is
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm whatis
.Op Fl C Ar file
.Op Fl M Ar path
.Op Fl m Ar path
.Op Fl S Ar arch
.Op Fl s Ar section
.Ar name ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility looks up the given commands and shows the header lines
from the manual pages.
You can then use the
.Xr man 1
command to get more information.
.Nm
will match manual page
.Ar names
on a case insensitive basis and for multiple word entries
will match on each individual word.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl C Ar file
Specify an alternate configuration
.Ar file
in
.Xr man.conf 5
format.
The default is
.Pa /etc/man.conf .
.It Fl M Ar path
Override the list of standard directories
.Nm
searches for its database named
.Pa mandoc.db .
The supplied
.Ar path
must be a colon
.Pq Ql \&:
separated list of directories.
This search path may also be set using the environment variable
.Ev MANPATH .
.It Fl m Ar path
Augment the list of standard directories
.Nm
searches for its database named
.Pa mandoc.db .
The supplied
.Ar path
must be a colon-separated list of directories.
These directories will be searched before the standard directories
or the directories supplied with the
.Fl M
option or the
.Ev MANPATH
environment variable are searched.
.It Fl S Ar arch
Restrict the search to pages for the specified
.Xr machine 1
architecture.
.Ar arch
is case insensitive.
By default, pages for all architectures are shown.
.It Fl s Ar section
Restrict the search to the specified section of the manual.
By default, pages from all sections are shown.
See
.Xr man 1
for a listing of sections.
.El
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
.Bl -tag -width MANPATH
.It Ev MANPATH
The standard search path used by
.Xr man 1
may be overridden by specifying a path in the
.Ev MANPATH
environment variable.
If
.Ev MANPATH
begins with a colon, it is appended to the default list;
if it ends with a colon, it is prepended to the default list;
or if it contains two adjacent colons,
the standard search path is inserted between the colons.
If none of these conditions are met, it overrides the
standard search path.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width "/etc/man.conf" -compact

.Sh HISTORY
Part of the functionality of
.Nm
was already provided by the former
.Nm manwhere
utility in
.Bx 1 .
The
.Nm
command first appeared in
.Bx 2 .
It was rewritten from scratch for
.Ox 5.6 .

The
.Fl M
option and the
.Ev MANPATH
variable first appeared in
.Bx 4.3 ;

in
.Bx 4.3 Reno ;

in
.Bx 4.4 Lite1 ;
and

and

wrote
.Nm manwhere
in 1977
and the original
