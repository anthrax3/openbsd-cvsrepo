@First step towards parser unification:
Replace enum mdoc_type and enum man_type by a unified enum roff_type.
Almost mechanical, no functional change.
Written on the ICE train from Frankfurt to Bruxelles on the way to p2k15.

@The files mandoc.c and mandoc.h contained both specialised low-level
functions used for multiple languages (mdoc, man, roff), for example
mandoc_escape(), mandoc_getarg(), mandoc_eos(), and generic auxiliary
functions.  Split the auxiliaries out into their own file and header.
While here, do some #include cleanup.

@Merge version 1.11.1:
Again lots of cleanup and maintenance work by kristaps@@.
- simplify error reporting: less function pointers, more mandoc_[v]msg
- main: split document parsing out of main.c into read.c
- roff, mdoc, man: improved recognition of control characters
- roff: better handling of if/else stack overflows
- roff: add some predefined strings for backward compatibility
- mdoc, man: empty sections are not errors
- mdoc: move delimiter handling to libmdoc
- some header restructuring and some minor features and fixes
This merge causes two minor regressions
that i will fix in separate commits right afterwards.

1.4
log
@Unified error and warning message system for all of mandoc,
featuring three message levels, as agreed during the mandoc hackathon:
* FATAL parser failure, cannot produce any output from this input file:
  eventually, we hope to convert most of these to ERRORs.
* ERROR, meaning mandoc cannot cope fully with the input syntax and will
  probably lose information or produce structurally garbled output;
  it will try to produce output anyway but exit non-zero at the end,
  which is eventually intended to make the ports infrastructure happy.
* WARNING, meaning you should clean up the input file, but output
  is probably mostly OK, so this will not cause error-exit at the end.
This commit is mostly just converting the old system to the new one; before
the classification will become really reliable, we must check all messages.

In particular,
* set up a new central message string table in main.c
* drop the old message string tables from man.c and mdoc.c
* get rid of the piece-meal merr enums in libman and libmdoc
* reduce number of error/warning functions from 16 to 6 (still a lot...)

While here, handle a few problems more gracefully:
* allow .Rv and .Ex to work without a prior .Nm
* allow .An to ignore extra arguments
* allow undeclared columns in .Bl -column

@sync to 1.9.12, mostly portability and refactoring:

correctness/functionality:
- bugfix: do not die when overstep hits the right margin
- new option: -fign-escape
- and various HTML features

portability:
- replace bzero(3) by memset(3), which is ANSI C
- replace err(3)/warn(3) by perror(3)/exit(3), which is ANSI C
- iuse argv[0] instead of __progname
- add time.h to various files for FreeBSD compilation

simplicity:
- do not allocate header/footer data dynamically in *_term.c
- provide and use malloc frontends that error out on failure
