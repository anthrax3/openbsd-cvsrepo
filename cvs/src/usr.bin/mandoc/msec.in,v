1.5
log
@Unify console and CGI section titles, bringing them closer to groff,
is an attempt to reduce confusion for users switching between media
and between different operating systems.

Not using the groff title for section 4 is intentional,
it is just too awful ("Kernel Interfaces Manual"), and
the difference from sections 2 and 9 would be too hard to see.

Positive feedback from at least deraadt@@ millert@@ bluhm@@ jca@@.
Previously also agreed with the general direction: jmc@@ Nick@@.
The title for 3p was polished by bluhm@@.
The existing mismatches were originally noticed by jsg@@.
