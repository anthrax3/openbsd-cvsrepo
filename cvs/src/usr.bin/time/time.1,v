.Nd time command execution
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm time
.Op Fl lp
.Ar utility
.Op Ar argument ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
executes and times
.Ar utility
with optional
.Ar arguments .
After the
.Ar utility
finishes,
.Nm
writes the total time elapsed,
the time consumed by system overhead,
and the time used to execute
.Ar utility
to the standard error stream.
Times are reported in seconds.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl l
The contents of the
.Em rusage
structure are printed.
.It Fl p
The output is formatted as specified by
.St -p1003.2-92 .
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /usr/include/sys/resource.h -compact
.It Pa /usr/include/sys/resource.h
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
The
.Nm
utility exits with one of the following values:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width indent -compact
.It 1\-125
An error occurred in the
.Nm
utility.
.It 126
The
.Ar utility
was found but could not be invoked.
.It 127
The
.Ar utility
could not be found.
.El
.Pp
Otherwise, the exit status of
.Nm
shall be that of
.Ar utility .
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr csh 1 ,
.Xr ksh 1 ,
.Xr getrusage 2
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Nm
utility is compliant with the
.St -p1003.1-2008
specification.
.Pp
The flag
.Op Fl l
is an extension to that specification.
.Pp
.Nm
also exists as a built-in to
.Xr csh 1
and
.Xr ksh 1 ,
though with a different syntax.
.Sh HISTORY
A
.Nm
command appeared in
.At v3 .
.Sh BUGS
The granularity of seconds on microprocessors is crude and
can result in times being reported for CPU usage which are too large by
a second.

@unveil that time(1) accepts optional arguments for the utility operand,
this way we not only improve the synopsis accuracy but also match
descriptions provided by IEEE Std 1003.1-2008, FreeBSD and NetBSD
for this command; while here, synchronize the operand name.

@i saw the previous was wrong as soon as i committed it: put the
built-in blurb in STANDARDS; we did once have a COMPATIBILITY section
which we merged with STANDARDS, so i think this is appropriate. it
certainly feels better than adding single sentences randomly to the
end of text bodies.
