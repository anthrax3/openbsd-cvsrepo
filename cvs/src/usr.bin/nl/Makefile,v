log
@Import nl(1) from the NetBSD source tree, with local changes discussed
on tech@@, among which `-' syntax for stdin, multibyte delimiter support
(based on FreeBSD) and various code simplifications.  Original diffs
from pascal@@ and later Arto Jonsson (ajonsson at kapsi dot fi),
comments and work by others, especially millert@@.
"That looks good to me." millert@@
