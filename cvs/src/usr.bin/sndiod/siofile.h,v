@if a device doesn't respond within two seconds, then just close it
and drop all connections. This is shameful but unfortunately it's
still necessery on certain MP machines and audio driver combinations

@Remplace aucat server by a new sndiod daemon aimed to be simpler
smaller and faster than aucat. It's a drop in replacement with the
following exceptions that don't affect the default setup:
  - The sample rate and the encoding are a per-device parameters
    thus -r and -e options must precede the corresponding -f option
  - MIDI thru boxes are dynamically created and no -M option
    is required anymore, so -M was removed.
  - MIDI ports are exposed with a new ``midi/N'' name, rather
    than abusing MIDI thru boxes.
