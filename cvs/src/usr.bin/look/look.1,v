.Sh NAME
.Nm look
.Nd display lines beginning with a given string
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm look
.Op Fl df
.Op Fl t Ar termchar
.Ar string
.Op Ar file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility displays any lines in
.Ar file
which contain
.Ar string
as a prefix.
As
.Nm
performs a binary search, the lines in
.Ar file
must be sorted.
.Pp
If
.Ar file
is not specified, the file
.Pa /usr/share/dict/words
is used.
Only alphanumeric characters are compared and the case of
alphabetic characters is ignored.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl d
Dictionary character set and order, i.e., only alphanumeric characters
are compared.
.It Fl f
Ignore the case of alphabetic characters.
.It Fl t Ar termchar
Specify a string termination character, i.e., only the characters
in
.Ar string
up to and including the first occurrence of
.Ar termchar
are compared.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /usr/share/dict/words -compact
.It Pa /usr/share/dict/words
the dictionary
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
The
.Nm
utility exits 0 if one or more lines were found and displayed,
1 if no lines were found, or \*(Gt1 if an error occurred.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr grep 1 ,
.Xr sort 1
.Sh STANDARDS
The original manual page stated that tabs and blank characters participated
in comparisons when the
.Fl d
option was specified.
This was incorrect and the current man page matches the historic
implementation.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command appeared in
.At v7 .
