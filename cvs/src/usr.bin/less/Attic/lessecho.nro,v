@Replace less with the cleaned-up fork of less 458 maintained by Garrett
D'Amore at https://github.com/gdamore/less-fork. This has significantly
less portability goop, has a tidied up code style, uses terminfo instead
of termcap, and is has stricter POSIX compliance.

Many of our local changes have been accepted upstream: substantial
remaining local changes are code to read help files from /usr/share
rather than compiling them in, man page and help improvements, and some
tweaks to the default options.
