@Replace less with the cleaned-up fork of less 458 maintained by Garrett
D'Amore at https://github.com/gdamore/less-fork. This has significantly
less portability goop, has a tidied up code style, uses terminfo instead
of termcap, and is has stricter POSIX compliance.

Many of our local changes have been accepted upstream: substantial
remaining local changes are code to read help files from /usr/share
rather than compiling them in, man page and help improvements, and some
tweaks to the default options.

@   This is a generic INSTALL file for utilities distributions.
If this package does not come with, e.g., installable documentation or
data files, please ignore the references to them below.

   The `configure' shell script attempts to guess correct values for
various system-dependent variables used during compilation, and
creates the Makefile(s) (one in each subdirectory of the source
directory).  In some packages it creates a C header file containing
system-dependent definitions.  It also creates a file `config.status'
that you can run in the future to recreate the current configuration.

To compile this package:

1.  Configure the package for your system.

   Normally, you just `cd' to the directory containing the package's
source code and type `./configure'.  If you're using `csh' on an old
version of System V, you might need to type `sh configure' instead to
prevent `csh' from trying to execute `configure' itself.

   Running `configure' takes awhile.  While it is running, it
prints some messages that tell what it is doing.  If you don't want to
see any messages, run `configure' with its standard output redirected
to `/dev/null'; for example, `./configure >/dev/null'.

   To compile the package in a different directory from the one
containing the source code, you must use a version of `make' that
supports the `VPATH' variable, such as GNU `make'.  `cd' to the
directory where you want the object files and executables to go and run
the `configure' script.  `configure' automatically checks for the
source code in the directory that `configure' is in and in `..'.  If
for some reason `configure' is not in the source code directory that
you are configuring, then it will report that it can't find the source
code.  In that case, run `configure' with the option `--srcdir=DIR',
where DIR is the directory that contains the source code.

   By default, `make install' will install the package's files in
`/usr/local/bin', `/usr/local/man', etc.  You can specify an
installation prefix other than `/usr/local' by giving `configure' the
option `--prefix=PATH'.  Alternately, you can do so by consistently
giving a value for the `prefix' variable when you run `make', e.g.,
     make prefix=/usr/gnu
     make prefix=/usr/gnu install

   You can specify separate installation prefixes for
architecture-specific files and architecture-independent files.  If you
give `configure' the option `--exec-prefix=PATH' or set the `make'
variable `exec_prefix' to PATH, the package will use PATH as the prefix
for installing programs and libraries.  Data files and documentation
will still use the regular prefix.  Normally, all files are installed
using the same prefix.

   Some packages pay attention to `--with-PACKAGE' options to
`configure', where PACKAGE is something like `gnu-as' or `x' (for the
X Window System).  They may also pay attention to `--enable-FEATURE'
options, where FEATURE indicates an optional part of the package.  The
README should mention any `--with-' and `--enable-' options that the
package recognizes.

   `configure' also recognizes the following options:

`--help'
     Print a summary of the options to `configure', and exit.

`--quiet'
`--silent'
     Do not print messages saying which checks are being made.

`--verbose'
     Print the results of the checks.

`--version'
     Print the version of Autoconf used to generate the `configure'
     script, and exit.

`--x-includes=DIR'
     X include files are in DIR.

`--x-libraries=DIR'
     X library files are in DIR.

   `configure' also accepts and ignores some other options.

   On systems that require unusual options for compilation or linking
that the package's `configure' script does not know about, you can give
`configure' initial values for variables by setting them in the
environment.  In Bourne-compatible shells, you can do that on the
command line like this:

     CC='gcc -traditional' LIBS=-lposix ./configure

On systems that have the `env' program, you can do it like this:

     env CC='gcc -traditional' LIBS=-lposix ./configure

   Here are the `make' variables that you might want to override with
environment variables when running `configure'.

   For these variables, any value given in the environment overrides the
value that `configure' would choose:

 - Variable: CC
     C compiler program.  The default is `cc'.

 - Variable: INSTALL
     Program to use to install files.  The default is `install' if you
     have it, `cp' otherwise.

   For these variables, any value given in the environment is added to
the value that `configure' chooses:

 - Variable: DEFS
     Configuration options, in the form `-Dfoo -Dbar...'.  Do not use
     this variable in packages that create a configuration header file.

 - Variable: LIBS
     Libraries to link with, in the form `-lfoo -lbar...'.

   If you need to do unusual things to compile the package, we encourage
you to figure out how `configure' could check whether to do them, and
mail diffs or instructions to the address given in the README so we
can include them in the next release.

2.  Type `make' to compile the package.  If you want, you can override
the `make' variables CFLAGS and LDFLAGS like this:

	make CFLAGS=-O2 LDFLAGS=-s

3.  If the package comes with self-tests and you want to run them,
type `make check'.  If you're not sure whether there are any, try it;
if `make' responds with something like
	make: *** No way to make target `check'.  Stop.
then the package does not come with self-tests.

4.  Type `make install' to install programs, data files, and
documentation.

5.  You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
source directory by typing `make clean'.  To also remove the
Makefile(s), the header file containing system-dependent definitions
(if the package uses one), and `config.status' (all the files that
`configure' created), type `make distclean'.

   The file `configure.in' is used to create `configure' by a program
called `autoconf'.  You only need it if you want to regenerate
`configure' using a newer version of `autoconf'.

   This file describes how to build and install less using 
the "configure" script.  This only works on Unix systems.  
To install on other systems, read the README file.


Basic Installation

various system-dependent variables used during compilation.  It uses
those values to create a `Makefile' in each directory of the package.
It may also create one or more `.h' files containing system-dependent
definitions.  Finally, it creates a shell script `config.status' that
you can run in the future to recreate the current configuration, a file
`config.cache' that saves the results of its tests to speed up
reconfiguring, and a file `config.log' containing compiler output
(useful mainly for debugging `configure').

   If you need to do unusual things to compile the package, please try
to figure out how `configure' could check whether to do them, and mail
diffs or instructions to the address given in the `README' so they can
be considered for the next release.  If at some point `config.cache'
contains results you don't want to keep, you may remove or edit it.

   The file `configure.in' is used to create `configure' by a program
called `autoconf'.  You only need `configure.in' if you want to change
it or regenerate `configure' using a newer version of `autoconf'.

The simplest way to compile this package is:

  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
     `./configure' to configure the package for your system.  If you're
     using `csh' on an old version of System V, you might need to type
     `sh ./configure' instead to prevent `csh' from trying to execute
     `configure' itself.

     Running `configure' takes awhile.  While running, it prints some
     messages telling which features it is checking for.

  2. Type `make' to compile the package.

  3. Optionally, type `make check' to run any self-tests that come with
     the package.

  4. Type `make install' to install the programs and any data files and
     documentation.

  5. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
     source code directory by typing `make clean'.  To also remove the
     files that `configure' created (so you can compile the package for
     a different kind of computer), type `make distclean'.  There is
     also a `make maintainer-clean' target, but that is intended mainly
     for the package's developers.  If you use it, you may have to get
     all sorts of other programs in order to regenerate files that came
     with the distribution.

Compilers and Options
=====================

   Some systems require unusual options for compilation or linking that
the `configure' script does not know about.  You can give `configure'
initial values for variables by setting them in the environment.  Using
a Bourne-compatible shell, you can do that on the command line like
this:
     CC=c89 CFLAGS=-O2 LIBS=-lposix ./configure

Or on systems that have the `env' program, you can do it like this:
     env CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include LDFLAGS=-s ./configure

Compiling For Multiple Architectures
====================================

   You can compile the package for more than one kind of computer at the
same time, by placing the object files for each architecture in their
own directory.  To do this, you must use a version of `make' that
d31 5
a35 10
source code in the directory that `configure' is in and in `..'.

   If you have to use a `make' that does not supports the `VPATH'
variable, you have to compile the package for one architecture at a time
in the source code directory.  After you have installed the package for
one architecture, use `make distclean' before reconfiguring for another
architecture.

Installation Names
==================
d40 4
a43 1
option `--prefix=PATH'.
d47 11
a57 21
give `configure' the option `--exec-prefix=PATH', the package will use
PATH as the prefix for installing programs and libraries.
Documentation and other data files will still use the regular prefix.

   In addition, if you use an unusual directory layout you can give
options like `--bindir=PATH' to specify different values for particular
kinds of files.  Run `configure --help' for a list of the directories
you can set and what kinds of files go in them.

   If the package supports it, you can cause programs to be installed
with an extra prefix or suffix on their names by giving `configure' the
option `--program-prefix=PREFIX' or `--program-suffix=SUFFIX'.

Optional Features
=================

   Some packages pay attention to `--enable-FEATURE' options to
`configure', where FEATURE indicates an optional part of the package.
They may also pay attention to `--with-PACKAGE' options, where PACKAGE
is something like `gnu-as' or `x' (for the X Window System).  The
`README' should mention any `--enable-' and `--with-' options that the
d60 1
a60 46
   For packages that use the X Window System, `configure' can usually
find the X include and library files automatically, but if it doesn't,
you can use the `configure' options `--x-includes=DIR' and
`--x-libraries=DIR' to specify their locations.

Specifying the System Type
==========================

   There may be some features `configure' can not figure out
automatically, but needs to determine by the type of host the package
will run on.  Usually `configure' can figure that out, but if it prints
a message saying it can not guess the host type, give it the
`--host=TYPE' option.  TYPE can either be a short name for the system
type, such as `sun4', or a canonical name with three fields:
     CPU-COMPANY-SYSTEM

See the file `config.sub' for the possible values of each field.  If
`config.sub' isn't included in this package, then this package doesn't
need to know the host type.

   If you are building compiler tools for cross-compiling, you can also
use the `--target=TYPE' option to select the type of system they will
produce code for and the `--build=TYPE' option to select the type of
system on which you are compiling the package.

Sharing Defaults
================

   If you want to set default values for `configure' scripts to share,
you can create a site shell script called `config.site' that gives
default values for variables like `CC', `cache_file', and `prefix'.
`configure' looks for `PREFIX/share/config.site' if it exists, then
`PREFIX/etc/config.site' if it exists.  Or, you can set the
`CONFIG_SITE' environment variable to the location of the site script.
A warning: not all `configure' scripts look for a site script.

Operation Controls
==================

   `configure' recognizes the following options to control how it
operates.

`--cache-file=FILE'
     Use and save the results of the tests in FILE instead of
     `./config.cache'.  Set FILE to `/dev/null' to disable caching, for
     debugging `configure'.

`-q'
d69 2

`--srcdir=DIR'
     Look for the package's source code in directory DIR.  Usually
     `configure' can determine that directory automatically.

`configure' also accepts some other, not widely useful, options.
