@fix a number of minor issues in the state view:

1. peak and rate computations were using uint32 size which caused
the fields from working for states that transferred more than 4GB
also fix an unnecessary cast to double found while looking for the bug.

2. When creating new cache entries for existing states, start time from
0 rather than the current time to prevent a "spike" in rate and peak.

@use a u_int64_t for the state id in pfsync_state. this makes it consistent
with every other thing that stores the state id (including other pfsync
messages).

includes improvements to the systat code to consider the creatorid as well
as the state id in its cache to avoid collisions between states created on
different hosts.

tested by me in production and on amd64 talking to sparc64.

log
@New display engine for systat, based on pftop. Adds new views for pf
(status, state, rule, queue). While all displays work, some keyboard
comands are not implemented yet. Other features include better handling
of display resize and scrolling for long views. Committing now to fix
the remaining issues in the tree.
