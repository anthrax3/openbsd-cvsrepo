.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm env
.Op Fl i
.Oo
.Ar name Ns = Ns Ar value ...
.Oc
.Oo
.Ar utility
.Op Ar argument ...
.Oc
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
executes
.Ar utility
after modifying the environment as
specified on the command line.
The option
.Ar name Ns = Ns Ar value
specifies
an environment variable,
.Ar name ,
with a value of
.Ar value .
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl i
Causes
.Nm
to completely ignore the environment it inherits.
.El
.Pp
If no
.Ar utility
is specified,
.Nm
prints out the names and values
of the variables in the environment, with one
.Ar name Ns = Ns Ar value
pair per line.
.Pp
.Nm
doesn't handle commands with equal
.Pq Sq =
signs in their
names, for obvious reasons.
.Sh EXIT STATUS
The
.Nm
utility exits with one of the following values:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It 0
.Nm
completed successfully and, if
.Ar utility
was specified, it was invoked and completed successfully too.
.It 1
An invalid command line option was passed to
.Nm
and
.Ar utility
was not invoked, or
.Ar utility
was invoked but failed with exit status 1.
.It 2\(en125, 128\(en255
.Ar utility
was invoked but failed with this exit status;
see its manual page for more information.
.It 126
.Ar utility
was found but could not be invoked, or it was invoked but failed
with exit status 126.
.It 127
.Ar utility
could not be found, or it was invoked but failed with exit status 127.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr execvp 3 ,
.Xr environ 7
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Nm
utility is compliant with the
.St -p1003.1-2008
specification.
.Pp
The historic
.Fl
option has been deprecated but is still supported in this implementation.
