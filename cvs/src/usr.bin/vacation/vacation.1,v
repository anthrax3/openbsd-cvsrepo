.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm vacation
.Nd provide absence notification when receiving email
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm vacation
.Fl i
.Op Fl r Ar interval
.Nm vacation
.Op Fl a Ar alias
.Ar login
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
returns a message to the sender of a message telling them that you
are currently not reading your mail.
The intended use is in a
.Pa .forward
file.
For example, your
.Pa .forward
file might have:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
\eeric, "|/usr/bin/vacation -a allman eric"
.Ed
.Pp
which would send messages to you (assuming your login name was eric) and
reply to any messages for
.Dq eric
or
.Dq allman .
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a Ar alias
Handle messages for
.Ar alias
in the same manner as those received for the user's
login name.
.It Fl i
Initialize the vacation database files.
It should be used before you modify your
.Pa .forward
file.
.It Fl r Ar interval
Set the reply interval to
.Ar interval
days.
The default is one week.
An interval of
.Dq 0
or
.Dq Li infinite
(actually, any non-numeric character) will never send more than
one reply.
.El
.Pp
Messages will not be replied to
if any of the following conditions are true:
.Bl -dash -offset indent
.It
Message are not
.Dq To:
or
.Dq Cc:
a valid
.Ar login
(or
.Ar alias
supplied using the
.Fl a
option).
.It
Messages are from
.Dq ???-REQUEST ,
.Dq Postmaster ,
.Dq Tn UUCP ,
.Dq MAILER ,
or
.Dq MAILER-DAEMON
(where these strings are case insensitive).
.It
A
.Dq Precedence: bulk ,
.Dq Precedence: list ,
or
.Dq Precedence: junk
line is included in the mail headers.
.It
An
.Dq Auto-Submitted
line is included in the mail headers
with a value of anything but
.Dq no .
.It
A
.Dq List-Id
line (with any value) is included in the mail headers.
.El
.Pp
The people who have sent you messages are maintained as a
Berkeley DB database in the file
.Pa .vacation.db
in your home directory.
.Pp
.Nm
expects a file
.Pa .vacation.msg ,
in your home directory, containing a message to be sent back to each
sender.
It should be an entire message (including headers).
For example, it might contain:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
From: eric@@CS.Berkeley.EDU (Eric Allman)
Subject: I am on vacation
Delivered-By-The-Graces-Of: The Vacation program
Precedence: bulk

I am on vacation until July 22.
If you have something urgent,
please contact Keith Bostic <bostic@@CS.Berkeley.EDU>.
--eric
.Ed
.Pp
Any occurrence of the string
.Li $SUBJECT
in
.Pa .vacation.msg
will be replaced by the subject of the message that triggered the
.Nm
program.
.Pp
.Nm
reads the incoming message from standard input, checking the message
headers for either the
.Ux
.Dq From
line or a
.Dq Return-Path
header to determine the sender.
If both are present the sender from the
.Dq Return-Path
header is used.
.Pp
Fatal errors, such as calling
.Nm
with incorrect arguments, or with non-existent
.Ar login Ns Ar s ,
are logged in the system log file, using
.Xr syslog 3 .
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width "vacation.dirxxx" -compact

1.20
log
@match behavior of current sendmail-based vacation: eliminate the concept that
an interval (-r) of 0 indicates sending a reply to every message (per sender),
but rather match the 'non-numeric' case where only one reply will be sent (per
sender).  default remains unchanged.  vacation database should be reinitalized
sometime before 2038.

removes the need for time_t casts.
