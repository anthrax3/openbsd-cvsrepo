@Trivial consequences of the previous list changes:

- audit code for Lst_Datum, it's never applied to an empty pointer,
so check can be removed -> turn into a macro,
- Lst_First, Lst_Last can become macro as well
- specialized version of Lst_Succ (Lst_Adv) to use in loops where it cannot
fail,
- Lst_Open can no longer fail. Trim down corresponding code.

@This removes the few instances of Lst_New left.
- replaces Lst_Duplicate with Lst_Clone, which does not allocate storage
- split Lst_Concat into Lst_Concat/Lst_ConcatDestroy
Thus, all the LstValid checks are gone, since we always invoke list
functions with valid pointers.

Note that dynamic list allocation accounted for roughly 20% of all calls
to malloc.  The extraneous calls to malloc left are now mostly in parse.c,
which makes some wasteful usage of temporary buffers.

With those few patches, the code is sturdier, and easier to maintain.

1.6
log
@This patch moves the definition of lists and list nodes to lst.h.
C is not well-suited for opaque data structures.

Then it proceeds by removing a lot of non-sensical casts and white space.

There are two motivations behind this change:
* small functions like Lst_First can now be redefined as macros safely
(otherwise, the cast would mean that you might write Lst_First(5) and
find out about it rather late)
* the size of the Lst data structure is exposed to user code. This will
be used to allocate lists statically, instead of malloc/free them like
crazy.

@NIL, NILGNODE, etc, are only glorified NULL.
Get rid of them.

Get rid of list.h, nothing uses it anyway.

- don't interfere with MACHINE/MACHINE_ARCH defines for bootstrap
- type clean-up, time_t, and printing `unknown' ints
- fix TARGET/MEMBER bug in archive rules
- memmove...
- cleaner Error handler.
- reentrant brk_string

Other improvements:
- efree
- shellneed streamlined
- display Stop in .CURDIR after an error.
- document most features and misfeatures.
- add a few OpenBSD notes to the tutorial.
