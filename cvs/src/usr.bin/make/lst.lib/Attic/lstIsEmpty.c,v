1.8
log
@Synch with my current work.
Numerous changes:
- generate can build several tables
- style cleanup
- statistics code
- use variable names throughout (struct Name)
- recursive variables everywhere
- faster parser (pass buffer along instead of allocating multiple copies)
- correct parser. Handles comments everywhere, and ; correctly
- more string intervals
- simplified dir.c, less recursion.
- extended for loops
- sinclude()
- finished removing extra junk from Lst_*
- handles ${@@D} and friends in a simpler way
- cleaned up and modular VarModifiers handling.
- recognizes some gnu Makefile usages and errors out about them.

Additionally, some extra functionality is defined by FEATURES. The set of
functionalities is currently hardcoded to OpenBSD defaults, but this may
include support for some NetBSD extensions, like ODE modifiers.

Backed by miod@@ and millert@@, who finally got sick of my endless patches...

@Some systematic clean-up.
- UNUSED macro that expands to __attribute__((unused)) for gcc
- move rcsid around so that they can be tagged UNUSED.
- activate -Wunused.
- use UNUSED instead of kludgy junk for function arguments.
- add extern to all extern prototypes.
- update comments in lst.h.
- clean up var.c a little bit, constifying arguments, updating comments...

1.6
log
@This removes the few instances of Lst_New left.
- replaces Lst_Duplicate with Lst_Clone, which does not allocate storage
- split Lst_Concat into Lst_Concat/Lst_ConcatDestroy
Thus, all the LstValid checks are gone, since we always invoke list
functions with valid pointers.

Note that dynamic list allocation accounted for roughly 20% of all calls
to malloc.  The extraneous calls to malloc left are now mostly in parse.c,
which makes some wasteful usage of temporary buffers.

With those few patches, the code is sturdier, and easier to maintain.

@NIL, NILGNODE, etc, are only glorified NULL.
Get rid of them.

Get rid of list.h, nothing uses it anyway.

@Sync with NetBSD:
- Merge in FreeBSD and Lite2 changes.
- Fix bug where a non-archive target with a .a suffix would always
  be considered to be out of date, since it does not have a TOC.
- Fix NetBSD PR #2930: declare missing variable.
