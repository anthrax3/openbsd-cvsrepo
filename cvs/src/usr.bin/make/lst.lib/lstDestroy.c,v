@Mostly clean-up:
- cut up those huge include files into separate interfaces for all modules.
Put the interface documentation there, and not with the implementation.
- light-weight includes for needed concrete types (lst_t.h, timestamp_t.h).
- cut out some more logically separate parts: cmd_exec, varname, parsevar,
timestamp.
- put all error handling functions together, so that we will be able to
clean them up.
- more systematic naming: functioni  to handle interval, function to handle
string.
- put the init/end code apart to minimize coupling.
- kill weird types like ReturnStatus and Boolean. Use standard bool (with a
fallback for non-iso systems)
- better interface documentation for lots of subsystems.

As a result, make compilation goes somewhat faster (5%, even considering
the largish BSD copyrights to read). The corresponding preprocessed
source goes down from 1,5M to 1M.

A few minor code changes as well: Parse_DoVar is no longer destructive.
Parse_IsVar functionality is folded into Parse_DoVar (as it knows what an
assignment is), a few more interval handling functions. Avoid calling
XXX_End when they do nothing, just #define XXX_End   to nothing.

Parse_DoVar is slightly more general: it will handle compound assignments
as long as they make sense, e.g., VAR +!= cmd
will work.  As a side effect, VAR++=value now triggers an error
(two + in assignment).
- this stuff doesn't occur in portable Makefiles.
- writing VAR++ = value or VAR+ +=value  disambiguates it.
- this is a good thing, it uncovered a bug in bsd.port.mk.

Tested by naddy@@. Okayed millert@@. I'll handle the fallback if there is
any. This went through a full make build anyways, including isakmpd
(without mickey's custom binutils, as he didn't see fit to share it with me).

@Synch with my current work.
Numerous changes:
- generate can build several tables
- style cleanup
- statistics code
- use variable names throughout (struct Name)
- recursive variables everywhere
- faster parser (pass buffer along instead of allocating multiple copies)
- correct parser. Handles comments everywhere, and ; correctly
- more string intervals
- simplified dir.c, less recursion.
- extended for loops
- sinclude()
- finished removing extra junk from Lst_*
- handles ${@@D} and friends in a simpler way
- cleaned up and modular VarModifiers handling.
- recognizes some gnu Makefile usages and errors out about them.

Additionally, some extra functionality is defined by FEATURES. The set of
functionalities is currently hardcoded to OpenBSD defaults, but this may
include support for some NetBSD extensions, like ODE modifiers.

Backed by miod@@ and millert@@, who finally got sick of my endless patches...

- add extern to all extern prototypes.

@This removes the few instances of Lst_New left.
- replaces Lst_Duplicate with Lst_Clone, which does not allocate storage
- split Lst_Concat into Lst_Concat/Lst_ConcatDestroy
Thus, all the LstValid checks are gone, since we always invoke list
functions with valid pointers.

Note that dynamic list allocation accounted for roughly 20% of all calls
to malloc.  The extraneous calls to malloc left are now mostly in parse.c,
which makes some wasteful usage of temporary buffers.

With those few patches, the code is sturdier, and easier to maintain.

@This patch introduces a distinction between
Lst_Init (constructor) and Lst_New (allocation + construction)
Lst_Destroy (destructor) and Lst_Delete (deallocation + destruction),
and uses that to turn most dynamic allocation of lists (Lst pointers)
into static structures (LIST).

Most of this is mundane, except for allGNs in targ.c, where the code must
be checked to verify that Targ_Init is called soon enough.

Lst_New is a temporary addition. All lists will soon be static.

@This patch moves the definition of lists and list nodes to lst.h.
C is not well-suited for opaque data structures.

Then it proceeds by removing a lot of non-sensical casts and white space.

There are two motivations behind this change:
* small functions like Lst_First can now be redefined as macros safely
(otherwise, the cast would mean that you might write Lst_First(5) and
find out about it rather late)
* the size of the Lst data structure is exposed to user code. This will
be used to allocate lists statically, instead of malloc/free them like
crazy.

@Thus, Lst_ForEach no longer needs returning a status.
In fact, it can become a macro based on Lst_ForEachFrom.
This also introduces Lst_Every, as a shortcut for the very common case where
Lst_ForEach does not need any user data.

Finally,  make consistent use of a few function typedefs, instead of having
explicit void (*)(Lst)  arguments all over the place.

- Merge in FreeBSD and Lite2 changes.
- Fix bug where a non-archive target with a .a suffix would always

- Fix NetBSD PR #2930: declare missing variable.
