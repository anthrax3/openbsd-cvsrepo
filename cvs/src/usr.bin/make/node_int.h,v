@- SPECIAL_DEPRECATED -> SPECIAL_NOTHING
- nodes for .POSIX and .SCCS_GET (which don't do anything)
- zap remaining suffix crud.

new scaffolding:
- groupling list and HELDBACK state to avoid races in engine.
- parser recognizes lists of targets that shoul be grouped together
- OP_DOUBLE to mark nodes that have multiple lists of commands

1.3
log
@make has had heuristics to avoid parallel make recursion.
Sometimes they mess up, so add .CHEAP/.EXPENSIVE to explicitly tell make
'hey this is not THAT bad' or 'worse than you think'.
agreed by guenther@@, millert@@ (and some tweaks)

1.2
log
@two small changes:
- allow variables in SysV modifiers, as requested by matthieu@@
(since recursive variables are an extension, this just extends the
extension)
- variation on :Q  called :QL (quote list), which does quote every character
EXCEPT for whitespace. e.g.,

toto:
	@@for i in ${VAR:QL} ...
