@two small changes:
- allow variables in SysV modifiers, as requested by matthieu@@
(since recursive variables are an extension, this just extends the
extension)
- variation on :Q  called :QL (quote list), which does quote every character
EXCEPT for whitespace. e.g.,

toto:
	@@for i in ${VAR:QL} ...

1.1
log
@Mostly clean-up:
- cut up those huge include files into separate interfaces for all modules.
Put the interface documentation there, and not with the implementation.
- light-weight includes for needed concrete types (lst_t.h, timestamp_t.h).
- cut out some more logically separate parts: cmd_exec, varname, parsevar,
timestamp.
- put all error handling functions together, so that we will be able to
clean them up.
- more systematic naming: functioni  to handle interval, function to handle
string.
- put the init/end code apart to minimize coupling.
- kill weird types like ReturnStatus and Boolean. Use standard bool (with a
fallback for non-iso systems)
- better interface documentation for lots of subsystems.

As a result, make compilation goes somewhat faster (5%, even considering
the largish BSD copyrights to read). The corresponding preprocessed
source goes down from 1,5M to 1M.

A few minor code changes as well: Parse_DoVar is no longer destructive.
Parse_IsVar functionality is folded into Parse_DoVar (as it knows what an
assignment is), a few more interval handling functions. Avoid calling
XXX_End when they do nothing, just #define XXX_End   to nothing.

Parse_DoVar is slightly more general: it will handle compound assignments
as long as they make sense, e.g., VAR +!= cmd
will work.  As a side effect, VAR++=value now triggers an error
(two + in assignment).
- this stuff doesn't occur in portable Makefiles.
- writing VAR++ = value or VAR+ +=value  disambiguates it.
- this is a good thing, it uncovered a bug in bsd.port.mk.

Tested by naddy@@. Okayed millert@@. I'll handle the fallback if there is
any. This went through a full make build anyways, including isakmpd
(without mickey's custom binutils, as he didn't see fit to share it with me).
