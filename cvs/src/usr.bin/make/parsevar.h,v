@two small changes:
- allow variables in SysV modifiers, as requested by matthieu@@
(since recursive variables are an extension, this just extends the
extension)
- variation on :Q  called :QL (quote list), which does quote every character
EXCEPT for whitespace. e.g.,

toto:
	@@for i in ${VAR:QL} ...

@A set of big related changes. okay millert@@, tested further by kettenis@@
and matthieu@@

This all revolves around putting ALL global variables into one single big
hash, and using flags. This removes some impossible to understand stuff,
like old varfind, and allows for some nice stuff.
- each time we reference a global variable, we create it, possibly as a dummy
variable.
- each time we go to the environment, we remember it, thus we no longer go
back to it.

Lists of dependant changes:
- isolate changes to oldVars and checkEnvFirst.
- remove VAR_CMD and VAR_GLOBAL contexts. The only distinction is in parsevar.
Split Parse_DoVar into Parse_DoVar and Parse_CmdlineVar
- rework var modules around obtain_global_var, observe flags in various
functions like Var_Value and Var_Seti.
- Var_Seti/Var_Appendi are almost the same code, use that internally.
- add magic to handle the very special SHELL variable.
- introduce Var_Definedi for the cases where we don't want the actual
value, to simplify tests.
- add keyword .poison, parse it and set global flags accordingly.
- do poison_checks where needed.
- document poison.
- in for loops, set variable temporarily, so that Var_SubstVar will also
substitute it in varmodifiers expressions.

@Mostly clean-up:
- cut up those huge include files into separate interfaces for all modules.
Put the interface documentation there, and not with the implementation.
- light-weight includes for needed concrete types (lst_t.h, timestamp_t.h).
- cut out some more logically separate parts: cmd_exec, varname, parsevar,
timestamp.
- put all error handling functions together, so that we will be able to
clean them up.
- more systematic naming: functioni  to handle interval, function to handle
string.
- put the init/end code apart to minimize coupling.
- kill weird types like ReturnStatus and Boolean. Use standard bool (with a
fallback for non-iso systems)
- better interface documentation for lots of subsystems.

As a result, make compilation goes somewhat faster (5%, even considering
the largish BSD copyrights to read). The corresponding preprocessed
source goes down from 1,5M to 1M.

A few minor code changes as well: Parse_DoVar is no longer destructive.
Parse_IsVar functionality is folded into Parse_DoVar (as it knows what an
assignment is), a few more interval handling functions. Avoid calling
XXX_End when they do nothing, just #define XXX_End   to nothing.

Parse_DoVar is slightly more general: it will handle compound assignments
as long as they make sense, e.g., VAR +!= cmd
will work.  As a side effect, VAR++=value now triggers an error
(two + in assignment).
- this stuff doesn't occur in portable Makefiles.
- writing VAR++ = value or VAR+ +=value  disambiguates it.
- this is a good thing, it uncovered a bug in bsd.port.mk.

Tested by naddy@@. Okayed millert@@. I'll handle the fallback if there is
any. This went through a full make build anyways, including isakmpd
(without mickey's custom binutils, as he didn't see fit to share it with me).
