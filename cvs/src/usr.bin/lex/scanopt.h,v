@Update flex from ancient 2.5.4 to the recent 2.5.39.
This work was all done by Serguey Parkhomovsky. Thanks.
Some changes from upstream:
* Removed autotools cruft/localization/texinfo manual/etc
* Kept the old manpage, as the new manpage is content-free
* Used safe string handling functions and fixed several compiler warnings
* pledge(2). Flex 2.5.39 now forks/execs its filter chains and needs proc
  exec in addition to what was previously pledged
* Removed register keyword from all variable declarations
* renamed parse.c, parse.h, scan.c, skel.c with init prefix so compiling
  flex outside of obj by accident wouldn't clobber the bootstrap files
* Minor fixes (spelling, accessing buf[strlen(buf) - 1] for zero-length
  strings in initscan.c/scan.l, etc) that were already in our tree

This is a huge change, so it's going in the tree code bomb style.
I'm not excited about the growth in complexity (like now running m4
to _post_ process lexers) but hopefully this will be a one time update
and we will now take "ownership" of the code.
