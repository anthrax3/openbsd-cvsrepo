Is there a difference between
  grep the memo[12]
and
  cat memo[12] >temp
  grep the <temp
Answer yes or no.

If you want to experiment, there are two files named "memo1" and
"memo2" in this directory.
#create memo1
   There is not room enough in the leaves to hold all the food
that plants make.  Much of the food has to be stored in other parts
of the plant.
   We eat the parts of plants where the most food is stored.  The
carrot plant stores food in its roots.  We eat the roots of carrots.
The celery plant stores food in its leaf stalks.  They are the parts
we eat.  Many kinds of plants store food in their fruits.  We eat
the fruits of these plants to get the stored food in them.
   Some kinds of plants have ways of protecting their stored food.
#create memo2
   Goldfish grow very slowly in an aquarium.  They grow so slowly
that it is hard to know that they grow at all.  If they are kept
outdoors in a pool, they grow much faster and they grow much larger,
too.  Sometimes they grow to be more than a foot long in an outdoor
pool.
   When goldfish are kept in an aquarium they often do not live very
long.  Sometimes they die in a few weeks, but they may live as long
as ten years.  Some people have kept goldfish in an outdoor pool for
thirty years.
   There are many different colors of goldfish.
