So far the only printing program we have seen
is "cat", which just copies one or more files
onto the terminal (or perhaps onto a file when used
with ">").
The next step up is the program "pr", which
prints files so that each file begins on a
new page, and the top of each page contains the date
and time the file was changed, and a running page number.
Use a single "pr" to print the two files in this directory
whose names begin with "fed". 
What page number is printed on the last page? Type "answer N"
where N is the page number.
#create fed1
   After an unequivocal experience of the inefficacy of
the subsisting federal government, you are called upon to
deliberate on a new Constitution for the United States
of America.  The subject speaks its own importance;
comprehending in its consequences nothing less than the
existence of the union, the safety and welfare of the
parts of which it is composed, the fate of an empire in many
respects the most interesting in the world.
#create fed2
It has been frequently remarked that it seems to have been
reserved to the people of this country, by their conduct and
example, to decide the important question, whether
societies of men are really capable or not of establishing
good government from reflection and choice, or whether
they are forever destined to depend for their political
constitutions on accident and force.  If there be any truth
in the remark, the crisis at which we are arrived may with
propriety be regarded as the era in which that
decision is to be made; and a wrong election of the part
we shall act may, in this view, deserve to be considered as
the general misfortune of mankind.
