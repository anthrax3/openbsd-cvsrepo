By default, "tail" prints the last 10 lines of its input.
You can change this default amount by specifying a different
amount as an optional argument.  For example,
  tail -5 file
prints the last 5 lines of "file". 
Collect the last line of the file "Ref" in a new file
called "last".  Type "ready" when you have finished.
(By the way, there is a limit to how big the number can be,
but it's usually at least 60 or 70 lines of normal text.)
