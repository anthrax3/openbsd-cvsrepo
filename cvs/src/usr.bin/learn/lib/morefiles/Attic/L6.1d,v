How many of the lines in the files "bio*" and "chem*"
contain the letters "the"?  Type "answer N", where
N is the number of lines.
#create bio1
   Roughly speaking, your eye is made of three balls, or layers,
fitted tightly one inside the other.  the tough white outermost
layer's function is to protect the others.  the middle layer gives
the front of your eye its brown, gray, or blue color.  The inside
of this layer is dark and full of tiny blood vessels.  The innermost
layer, called the retina, is made of very special nerve cells that
are sensitive to light and color.  A nerve cord connects the retina
of each eye to your brain.
   The front of your eye's two outer layers (the cornea) is clear,
or open, to let light enter.
#create bio2
   We do not know when life began on the earth, and it seems likely
that the answer to this question will remain forever hidden from us.
What we do know is that it was some 500 million years ago when the
plants and animals of early geologic history had reached a stage of
development where they produced hard parts capable of being preserved
as fossils.
   At this distant date there seemingly was no land life; all life
was in the sea.  Moreover, there were no vertebrates, or backboned
animals, living -- at least none of sufficient complexity that they
left hard structures to be preserved in the form of fossils.
#create chema
   The baker said, "Now I shall put just the right amounts of water and
yeast with the flour that is in the mixer.  Flour, water, and yeast
together make the sponge.  Making sponge is the first step in making
bread."
   The baker closed the mixer.  Inside the machine, the flour and
yeast and water went around and around until they were well mixed.
Then the baker opened the mixer and the sponge dropped into a greased
tub called a trough.
   The baker pushed the trough into a warm room to let the sponge 
rise.  It looked like dough, but it did not as yet have everything
in it.
#create chemb
   Wash the blackboard.  Watch it dry.  The water goes into the air.
When water goes into the air it evaporates.
   Tie a damp cloth to one end of a stick.  Tie a bottle to the
other end.  Put water in the bottle until the stick is level.  Watch
the stick for a few minutes.  It does not stay level.
   Water goes into the air when it evaporates.  It changes into
water vapor.  You cannot see water vapor, but it is in the air all
around you.
   Cut a hold in the bottom of a cardboard box.  Hold the box
against a cold window and blow into the hole.
