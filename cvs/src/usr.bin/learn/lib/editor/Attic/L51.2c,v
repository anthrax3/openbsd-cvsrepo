How would you look for a blank line?  Do you
understand

  /^$/p

Note this command: it looks for the beginning of the
line, followed immediately by the end of the line.  If
there are any characters in between, it will keep
looking for a line with no__ characters at all.  All right.
The file "text" contains an extraneous blank line.
Delete it and rewrite the file.

   When the people of America reflect that they are now
called upon to decide a question, which in its consequences
must prove one of the most important that ever
engaged their attention, the propriety of their taking a
very comprehensive, as well as a very serious, view of it
will be evident.
   Nothing is more certain than the indispensable necessity
of government; and it is equally undeniable that
whenever and however it is instituted, the people must
cede to it some of their natural rights, in order to vest it
with requisite powers.  It is well worthy of consideration,
therefore, whether it would conduce more to the interest
of the people of America that they should, to all
general purposes, be one nation, under one federal government,
than that they should divide themselves into
separate confederacies and give to the head of each the
same kind of powers which they are advised to place in
one national government.
   It has until lately been a received and uncontradicted
opinion that the prosperity of the people of America
depended on their continuing firmly united, and the wishes,
prayers, and efforts of our best and wisest citizens have
been constantly directed to that object.  But politicians
now appear who insist that this opinion is erroneous,
and that instead of looking for safety and happiness in
union, we ought to seek it in a division of the States
into distinct confederacies or sovereignties.  However
extraordinary this new doctrine may appear, it nevertheless
has its advocates; and certain characters who were
much opposed to it formerly are at present of the number.
Whatever may be the arguments or inducements
which have wrought this change in the sentiments and
declarations of these gentlemen, it certainly would not be
wise in the people at large to adopt these new political
tenets without being fully convinced that they are founded
in truth and sound policy.
