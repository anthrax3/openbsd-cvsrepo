@#print
A strange, and not often important command, is the 'l'
(list) command.  When it is needed, though, it is vital.
It is almost identical to 'p' (print) except that control
characters (like tab or backspace) are printed in a way
that lets you see what they are no matter what the terminal does.
From time to time strange characters will
sneak into your files; they won't show when you print
them, and yet they will confuse you.  For example,
you might be unable to find a line by searching
for it with
 /abc/
and yet it would print as "abc" if there were
a funny character in the line between 'a' and 'b'.
Funny characters are generated by hitting the control
keys on the terminal; they print as '\' followed
by a number.
There is a file "weird" in this directory.  Print
it both with "1,$p" and "1,$l"
and observe the difference.  Then leave the editor.
Which word on the last line has a funny character in it?
Type "answer WORD" where WORD is that word (without the funny
symbol).
#create weird
This line	has	tabs	in	it.
So		does		this	one.
Here is a line with____ backspaces of a useful sort.
These backspacesonlyconfuse matters.

there's a strange character in this line even though it prints ok.
