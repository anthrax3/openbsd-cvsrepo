I. Introduction

This document describes the problems of
designing complex systems without adequately
trained manpower. The solution adopted was
to trick 90% of the staff into thinking they
were working on the system when in fact they were not.
This let the remaining 1:0% of the staff actually get
the thing built.

The project   began on   June 1, 1974.   It was completed
on Sept. 1, 1975   and has worked successfully   since then.
