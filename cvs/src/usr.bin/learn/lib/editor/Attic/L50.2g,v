The file "amend" contains an erroneous copy of the first
four amendments to the Constitution.  Find the line
saying "suspicion" and change it to read
"but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation,"
and then rewrite the file and type "ready".
#create Ref
1. Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion,
or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech,
or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble,
and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.

2. A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security
of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear arms
shall not be infringed.

3. No Soldier shall, in time of peace, be quartered
in any house without the consent of the Owner, nor in time
of war, but in a manner to be prescribed by law.

4. The right of the people to be secure in their persons,
houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and
seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue,
but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation,
and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the
persons or things to be seized.
