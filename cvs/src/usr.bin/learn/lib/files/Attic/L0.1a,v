WARNING: This course was written for UNIX in 1979, not 1999,
and has not yet been fully updated. Some details may be way out of date!

This course will help you learn about basic file
handling commands.  You should first understand
the special characters ERASE and KILL: 
  ERASE cancels the previous character typed;
  KILL cancels the line being typed.
ERASE and KILL are mapped to two non-text keyboard characters.
ERASE is usually one of CTRL/H (which means hold down the CTRL or
Control key WHILE you type the letter H) or the DEL (Delete) key.
KILL is mapped to some character like CTRL/U.

Type the stty command at the prompt. Examine its output.
Type "ready" (without the quotes) when you've finished.
