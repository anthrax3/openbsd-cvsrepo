@OpenCVS README
==============

This release of OpenCVS is for OpenBSD systems only.
Please consult http://www.opencvs.org/ for portable release availability.

This is a BSD-licensed equivalent of the popular versioning system
CVS.  It is currently in development and thus is not yet suited to replace
GNU CVS entirely.  This program should NOT be used on a development tree
unless you don't care about losing your modifications due to possible bugs.

The OpenCVS binary is installed as /usr/bin/opencvs.  Man pages for OpenCVS
are not installed, yet.

See http://www.opencvs.org/ for more information.

To build and install this release on your OpenBSD system, do the following:

	# cd /usr/src/usr.bin/cvs
	# make obj
	# make cleandir
	# make && make install

The OpenCVS binary will be installed as /usr/bin/opencvs to
prevent people from accidently overwriting their GNU CVS binary for now.
