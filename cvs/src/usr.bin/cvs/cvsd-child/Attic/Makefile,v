@Split the cvs daemon into two different processes: cvsd and cvsd-child.
The cvsd process only takes care of managing children and repository
locks, while the child handles all requests made to access or modify
the contents of the repository.
This will allow us to take advantage of randomized library remapping
and new propolice cookies, and minimizes the amount of code that can
run with elevated privileges.  Still work in progress.
