@put cvs(1)'s FILES, cvsignore(5), cvsrc(5), and cvswrappers(5)
into a single file, cvs(5), dedicated to cvs file formats;

this will trim cvs(1) a little, and stop us having a hundred cvs pages;

.Sh NAME
.Nm cvswrappers
.Nd CVS filters
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
file, located in
.Pa $CVSROOT/CVSROOT
and/or
.Pa $HOME/.cvswrappers ,
provides a way to configure filters for
.Xr cvs 1
based on file type (name).
This works by specifying a pattern to match for varying file types.
.Pp
The format of each line is as follows:
.Pp
.Dl pattern [option 'value'] [option 'value'] ...
.Pp
The following options are supported:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl f Ar filter
Execute
.Ar filter
when the file is extracted from the repository (for the
.Ic checkout ,
.Ic export ,
and
.Ic update
commands).
.It Fl k Ar mode
Specify the keyword substitution mode.
See the
.Sx KEYWORD SUBSTITUTION
section of
.Xr rcs 1
for more information.
.It Fl m Ar method
Specify the merge methodology to be used when a file is updated.
.Pp
The methods are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It COPY
When the
.Ic update
command is used,
.Xr cvs 1
will merely copy one version over another and let the user do the merge
by himself.
This method is used by default on binary files (see the
.Fl k Ar b
option).
.It MERGE
Try to merge the files.
This method is the default.
.El
.It Fl t Ar filter
Execute
.Ar filter
before the file is archived in the repository (for the
.Ic commit ,
and
.Ic import
commands).
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
Handle jpeg files as binaries:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
*.jpg -k 'b'
.Ed
.Pp
Indent C files before archiving them:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
*.[ch] -t 'indent %s'
.Ed
