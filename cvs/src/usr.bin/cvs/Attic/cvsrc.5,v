@put cvs(1)'s FILES, cvsignore(5), cvsrc(5), and cvswrappers(5)
into a single file, cvs(5), dedicated to cvs file formats;

this will trim cvs(1) a little, and stop us having a hundred cvs pages;

.Sh NAME
.Nm cvsrc
.Nd startup resource file for CVS
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
file provides a way to give the
.Xr cvs 1
program implicit global options and command-specific options.
Unless the
.Fl f
option is specified,
.Xr cvs 1
reads its startup configuration file
.Pa .cvsrc
from the home directory of the user who invoked it.
.Pp
The format of each line is as follows:
.Pp
.Dl command [arg ...]
.Pp
where
.Ar command
is either the
.Sq cvs
keyword to specify global options, one of the supported
.Xr cvs 1
commands or a command alias.
Arguments following
.Ar command
will be added implicitly to the appropriate command's argument vector if it is
run.
Lines whose
.Ar command
argument is not a valid command will generate a warning when running without
the
.Fl q
or
.Fl Q
flags.
.Pp
Empty lines and lines specifying no optional arguments are ignored.
A line beginning with a hash character
.Pq Sq #
is considered a comment and ignored.
.Sh EXAMPLES
Specify that
.Xr cvs 1
should always run in quiet mode and the
.Ic diff
internal command should always produce unified output:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
cvs -q
diff -u
.Ed

.Xr cvsintro 7
