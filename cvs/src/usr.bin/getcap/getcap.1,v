.Dt GETCAP 1
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm getcap
.Nd capability database access utility
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm getcap
.Oo
.Fl b Ar boolean | Fl c Ar capability |
.Fl n Ar number | Fl s Ar string
.Oc
.Fl f Ar path
.Fl a | Ar record ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility provides a simple method for querying a capability database such as
.Pa /etc/login.conf
or
.Pa /etc/printcap
and as described by
.Xr getcap 3 .
.Pp
The following query types are supported:
.Bl -tag -width "capability"
.It boolean
A boolean flag.
For each matching record, the name of the boolean capability is printed
(since there is no value per se).
.It number
A numeric capability (key#number).
For each matching record, the value of the numeric capability is printed
as a decimal number.
To print a number in the same format as it is listed in the
capabilities database (i.e. literally), use a
.Dq raw
query instead.
.It string
A string capability (key=value).
Note that the value printed has escape sequences expanded: see
.Xr getcap 3
for a list of valid escape sequences.
To print the string exactly as it is listed in the
capabilities database, use a
.Dq raw
query instead.
.It raw
A generic query where no interpretation of the data is done.
Use this for querying capabilities with non-standard types or
for getting the raw, unformatted entry from the database.
.El
.Pp
.Nm
prints the value associated with the given key.
If more than one record is being searched, the value is prefixed
with the record name (for records with multiple names, only the
first is printed).
If a key has no associated value and a boolean query is not being
performed, a blank line will be printed.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width "-c capability"
.It Fl a
Query all records in the database.
.It Fl b Ar boolean
Return occurrences of
.Ar boolean .
.It Fl c Ar capability
Return the raw value for the key
.Ar capability ,
which must include the type as the last character, e.g.\&
.Dq foo=
for the string
.Sq foo .
See
.Xr getcap 3
for more information on capability types.
.It Fl f Ar path
A colon-separated list of database filenames to be searched for records.
.It Fl n Ar number
Return occurrences of
.Ar number .
.It Fl s Ar string
Return occurrences of the string
.Ar string .
.El
.Pp
Only one of the
.Fl b ,
.Fl c ,
.Fl n ,
and
.Fl s
options may be specified.
If none are specified, the record will be dumped from the database as is.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width "/etc/login.confXX" -compact
.It Pa /etc/login.conf
login configuration
.It Pa /etc/printcap
printer configuration
.It Pa /etc/termcap
terminal configuration
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
Find all
.Xr login.conf 5
entries with the
.Dq ignorenologin
capability:
.Pp
.Dl "$ getcap -f /etc/login.conf -a -b ignorenologin"
.Pp
Dump the
.Dq default
record in
.Xr login.conf 5 :
.Pp
.Dl "$ getcap -f /etc/login.conf default"
.Pp
Print all
.Xr login.conf 5
records with the
.Dq localcipher
capability:
.Pp
.Dl "$ getcap -f /etc/login.conf -a -s localcipher"
.Pp
Print the
.Dq datasize-max
capability in the
.Dq staff
record in
.Xr login.conf 5
if it exists:
.Pp
.Dl "$ getcap -f /etc/login.conf -s datasize-max staff"
.Pp
Print all
.Xr printcap 5
entries that reference
.Pa /dev/lp .
Note that we are treating the entire string
.Dq lp=/dev/lp
as a boolean flag instead of a key/value pair.
.Pp
.Dl "$ getcap -f /etc/printcap -a -b lp=/dev/lp"
