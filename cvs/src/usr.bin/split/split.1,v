@Reduce usage of predefined strings in manpages.

Predefined strings are not very portable across troff implementations,
and they make the source much harder to read. Usually the intended
character can be written directly.

No output changes, except for two instances where the incorrect escape
was used in the first place.

.Sh NAME
.Nm split
.Nd split a file into pieces
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm split
.Op Fl a Ar suffix_length
.br
.Oo
.Fl b
.Sm off
.Ar byte_count Op Cm k | m
.Sm on
.No \&| Fl l Ar line_count
.No \&| Fl p Ar pattern
.Oc
.Op Ar file Op Ar name
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility reads the given
.Ar file ,
or standard input if no file is specified,
and breaks it up into files of 1000 lines each.
.Ar file
itself is not altered.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a Ar suffix_length
Use
.Ar suffix_length
letters to form the suffix of the file name
(see below).
The default suffix length is 2.
.It Xo
.Fl b
.Sm off
.Ar byte_count
.Op Cm k | m
.Sm on
.Xc
Create files
.Ar byte_count
bytes in length.
If
.Sq k
is appended to the number, the file is split into
.Ar byte_count
kilobyte pieces.
If
.Sq m
is appended to the number, the file is split into
.Ar byte_count
megabyte pieces.
.It Fl l Ar line_count
Create files
.Ar line_count
lines in length.
.It Fl p Ar pattern
The file is split whenever an input line matches
.Ar pattern ,
which is interpreted as an extended regular expression.
The matching line will be the first line of the next output file.
This option is incompatible with the
.Fl b
and
.Fl l
options.
.El
.Pp
If
.Ar name
is specified,
it is used as a prefix
for the names of the files into which the file is split.
In this case, each file into which the file is split is named by the
prefix followed by a lexically ordered suffix using
.Ar suffix_length
characters in the range
.Dq a-z .
.Pp
If the
.Ar name
argument is not specified, the file is split into lexically ordered
files named with the prefixes
.Sq x ,
.Sq y ,
and
.Sq z .
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std split
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr csplit 1 ,
.Xr re_format 7
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Nm
utility is compliant with the
.St -p1003.1-2008
specification.
.Pp
The flag
.Op Fl p ,
as well as the
.Sq y
and
.Sq z
prefixes in the absence of a
.Ar name
parameter,
are an extension to that specification.
.Sh HISTORY
A
.Nm
command appeared in
.At v3 .
.Sh BUGS
The maximum line length for matching patterns is 65536.

1.17
log
@saying that -b and -l create smaller files can be misleading - the author
was probably thinking of the fact that files created would be smaller than
the original file split; instead, just say that they create files.

this comes from freebsd pr#119329, submitted by Julian Stacey.
his fix was to introduce the notion of "split files", but the idea of
"create split files" can be just as confusing, so i've gone with removing
the original, ambiguous, adjective.
