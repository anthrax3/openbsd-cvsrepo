.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm lastcomm
.Nd show last commands executed in reverse order
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm lastcomm
.Op Fl f Ar file
.Op Ar command ...
.Op Ar user ...
.Op Ar terminal ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm lastcomm
gives information on previously executed commands.
With no arguments,
.Nm lastcomm
prints information about all the commands recorded
during the current accounting file's lifetime.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl f Ar file
Read from
.Ar file
rather than the default
accounting file.
.El
.Pp
If called with arguments, only accounting entries with a
matching
.Ar command
name,
.Ar user
name,
or
.Ar terminal
name
are printed.
So, for example:
.Pp
.Dl lastcomm a.out root ttyd0
.Pp
would produce a listing of all the
executions of commands named
.Pa a.out
by user
.Ar root
on the terminal
.Ar ttyd0 .
.Pp
For each process entry, the following are printed:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -offset indent -compact
.It
Name of the user who ran the process.
.It
Flags, as accumulated by the system's accounting facilities.
.It
Command name under which the process was called.
.It
Amount of CPU time used by the process (in seconds).
.It
Time the process started.
.It
Elapsed time of the process.
.El
.Pp
The flags are encoded as follows:
.Sq S
indicates the command was
executed by the superuser,
.Sq F
indicates the command ran after
a fork, but without a following
.Xr exec 3 ,
.Sq C
indicates the command was run in PDP-11 compatibility mode
(VAX only),
.Sq D
indicates the command terminated with the generation of a
.Pa core
file, and
.Sq X
indicates the command was terminated with a signal.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /var/account/acct -compact
.It Pa /var/account/acct
default accounting file
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr last 1 ,
.Xr sigvec 3 ,
.Xr acct 5 ,
.Xr core 5 ,
.Xr accton 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm lastcomm
command appeared in
.Bx 3.0 .
