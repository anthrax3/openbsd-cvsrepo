.Sh NAME
.Nm leave
.Nd remind you when you have to leave
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm leave
.Op Oo Cm + Oc Ns Ar hhmm
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm leave
waits until the specified time, then reminds you that you
have to leave.
You are reminded 5 minutes and 1 minute before the actual
time, at the time, and every minute thereafter.
When you log off,
.Nm leave
exits just before it would have
printed the next message.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ar hhmm
The time of day is in the form
.Ar hhmm
where
.Ar hh
is a time in
hours (on a 12 or 24 hour clock), and
.Ar mm
in minutes.
In ambiguous cases, times are converted to a 12 hour clock,
and assumed to be in the next 12 hours.
.It Cm +
If the time is preceded by
.Ql + ,
the alarm will go off in hours and minutes
from the current time.
.El
.Pp
If no argument is given,
.Nm leave
prompts with "When do you
have to leave?".
A reply of newline causes
.Nm leave
to exit,
otherwise the reply is assumed to be a time.
This form is suitable for inclusion in a
.Pa .login
or
.Pa .profile .
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr calendar 1
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm leave
command appeared in
.Bx 3.0 .

@Between groff-1.15 and groff-1.20.1, the .Ns macro was changed to no
longer suppress spacing when used at the beginning of an input line,
and mandoc now follows the same behaviour as new groff.
Thus, sweep the tree and remove useless .Ns.

@Fix 12 hours handling, so that you can say leave 1830 when it is 1800.
