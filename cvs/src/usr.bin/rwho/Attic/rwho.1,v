.Sh NAME
.Nm rwho
.Nd who is logged in on local machines
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm rwho
.Op Fl a
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command produces output similar to
.Xr who 1 ,
but for all machines on the local network.
If no report has been
received from a machine for 11 minutes then
.Nm
assumes the machine is down, and does not report users last known
to be logged into that machine.
.Pp
If a user hasn't typed to the system for a minute or more, then
.Nm
reports this idle time.
If a user hasn't typed to the system for an hour or more,
then the user will be omitted from the output of
.Nm
unless the
.Fl a
flag is given.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /var/rwho/rhowd.* -compact
.It Pa /var/rwho/whod.*

.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr finger 1 ,
.Xr rup 1 ,
.Xr ruptime 1 ,
.Xr rusers 1 ,
.Xr who 1 ,
.Xr rwhod 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command
appeared in
.Bx 4.3 .
.Sh BUGS
The
.Nm
protocol only supports up to eight character login names even though
.Ox
supports much longer ones.
Long login names will be truncated.
.Pp
.Nm
is unwieldy when the number of machines on the local net is large.

@o Add an extra byte for out_line and out_name in struct myutmp so we
  can treat these as normal C strings.  Fixes PR 2092
o KNF and ANSI fixes
o Avoid strncpy() since well-meaning folks will try to convert to strlcpy()
  even when it is not sensible to do so.
o Document the fact that the rwho protocol only supports up to 8 chars
  for a username.
