# IBM OS/400 (i5/OS) Save file (SAVF) - gerardo.cacciari@@gmail.com
# In spite of its quite variable format (due to internal memory page
# length differences between CISC and RISC versions of the OS) the
# SAVF structure hasn't suitable offsets to identify the catalog
# header in the first descriptor where there are some useful infos,
# so we must search in a somewhat large area for a particular string
# that represents the EBCDIC encoding of 'QSRDSSPC' (save/restore
# descriptor space) preceded by a two byte constant.
