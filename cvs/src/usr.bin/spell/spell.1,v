.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm spell

.Op Fl d Ar list
.Op Fl h Ar spellhist
.Oo
.Fl m
.Ar a | e | l | m | s
.Oc
.Op Fl s Ar list

.Op Ar
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm spell
collects words from the named documents and looks them up in a spelling list.
Words that neither occur among nor are derivable (by applying certain
inflections, prefixes or suffixes) from words in the spelling list
are printed on the standard output.
.Pp
If no files are named, words are collected from the standard input.
.Nm
ignores most troff, tbl, eqn, and pic constructions.
Copies of all output may be accumulated in the history file,
if one is specified.
.Pp
By default,
.Nm
(like
.Xr deroff 1 )
follows chains of included files
.Po
.Dq .so
and
.Dq .nx
commands
.Pc .
.Pp
The default spelling list is based on Webster's Second International
dictionary and should be fairly complete.
Words that appear in the
.Dq stop list
are immediately flagged as misspellings, regardless of whether or not
they exist in one of the word lists.
This helps filter out misspellings (e.g. thier=thy\-y+ier)
that would otherwise pass.
Additionally, the
.Pa british
file is also used as a stop list unless the
.Fl b
option is specified.
.Pp
Site administrators may add words to the local word list,
.Pa /usr/local/share/dict/words
or the local stop list,
.Pa /usr/local/share/dict/stop .
.Pp
All word (and stop) lists must be sorted in lexicographical order
with case folded.
The simplest way to achieve this is to use
.Dq sort -df .
If the word files are incorrectly sorted,
.Nm
will not be able to operate correctly.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl b
Check British spelling.
Besides preferring
.Em centre , colour , speciality , travelled ,
etc., this option insists upon
.Fl ise
in words like
.Em standardise ,
Fowler and the OED to the contrary notwithstanding.
In this mode, American variants of words are added to the stop list.
.It Fl d Ar list
Use the specified word list instead of the default system word list.
The word list must be sorted as specified above.
.It Fl h Ar spellhist
Store misspelled words in the specified history file.
The output of
.Li who -m
is appended to the history file after the list of misspelled words.
.It Fl i
Instruct
.Xr deroff 1
to ignore
.Dq .so
and
.Dq .nx
commands.
.It Fl l
Use
.Sy delatex
instead of
.Xr deroff 1
if it is present on the system.
.It Fl m
Enable support for common
troff macro packages; this option is passed verbatim to
.Xr deroff 1 .
Refer to the
.Fl m
description in
.Xr deroff 1
for details.
.It Fl s Ar list
Use the specified stop list instead of the default system stop list.
The stop list must be sorted as specified above.
.It Fl t
Use
.Sy detex
instead of
.Xr deroff 1
if it is present on the system.
.It Fl v
Print all words not literally in the spelling list in addition to
plausible derivations from spelling list words.
.It Fl x
Print every plausible stem, prefixed with
.Sq = .
.It + Ns Ar extra_list
Use
.Ar extra_list
in addition to the default word list.
The extra word list must be sorted as specified above.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /usr/local/share/dict/wordsxx -compact
.It Pa /usr/share/dict/words
Default spelling list.
.It Pa /usr/share/dict/american
American spelling of certain words.
.It Pa /usr/share/dict/british
British spelling of certain words.
.It Pa /usr/share/dict/stop
Default stop list.
.It Pa /usr/local/share/dict/words
Local spelling list (optional).
.It Pa /usr/local/share/dict/stop
Local stop list (optional).
.It Pa /usr/libexec/spellprog
Binary executed by the shell script
.Pa /usr/bin/spell .
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr deroff 1 ,
.Xr look 1 ,
.Xr sed 1 ,
.Xr sort 1 ,
.Xr tee 1
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm spell
command appeared in
.At v6 .
.Pp
Unlike historic versions, the
.Ox
.Nm
command does not use hashed word files.
Instead, it uses lexicographically sorted files and the same technique as
.Xr look 1 .
.Sh BUGS
The spelling list lacks many technical terms; new installations will
probably wish to monitor the output for several months to gather local
additions.
.Pp
British spelling was done by an American.
.Pp
In
.Fl x
mode it would be nicer if the stems were grouped with the appropriate word.

@spell command from 4.4BSD, now freed by Caldera.
I have made some significant changes:
o spell no longer uses hashed files.  The algorithm for generating
  the hashed files breaks down for large files.  Instead, I use the
  same approach as look(1) and do binary searches of mmap(2)ed files
  which has acceptable performance.  A side effect of this is that
  spell can now search multiple word lists.
o The spell binary has been renamed to "spellprog" so as to not conflict
  with the spell shell script.  This is consistent with other operating
  systems.
o The putsuf() and putword() functions have been renamed to
  trypref() and tryword() respectively for consistency with modern
  versions and for general sanity.
o the spell front-end shell script has been completely rewritten
o The code has been ANSIfied and re-style(9)d

spell currently must be compiled with -fwriteable-strings to make
the -b option work.  This should be fixed.
