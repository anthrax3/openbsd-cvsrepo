1.1
log
@spell command from 4.4BSD, now freed by Caldera.
I have made some significant changes:
o spell no longer uses hashed files.  The algorithm for generating
  the hashed files breaks down for large files.  Instead, I use the
  same approach as look(1) and do binary searches of mmap(2)ed files
  which has acceptable performance.  A side effect of this is that
  spell can now search multiple word lists.
o The spell binary has been renamed to "spellprog" so as to not conflict
  with the spell shell script.  This is consistent with other operating
  systems.
o The putsuf() and putword() functions have been renamed to
  trypref() and tryword() respectively for consistency with modern
  versions and for general sanity.
o the spell front-end shell script has been completely rewritten
o The code has been ANSIfied and re-style(9)d

spell currently must be compiled with -fwriteable-strings to make
the -b option work.  This should be fixed.
