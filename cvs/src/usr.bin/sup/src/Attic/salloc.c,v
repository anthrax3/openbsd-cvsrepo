@o kill register
o lots of KNF
o passes -Wall
o fix some [ug]id_t vs. int issues
o use strlcpy/strlcat in favor of strncpy/strncat
o use mem* routines everywhere instead of old b* ones
o marked several questionable things for later fixing
o kill ci.c and cvt.c -- we don't use them
o kill read_line.c since it requires fgetln() (bad for portability)
o kill salloc.c since it is the same as strup()
o Replaced some #ifdef __OpenBSD__ with better tests
o remaining problems: malloc return values are rarely checked, select misuse

@Sync with NetBSD.  Notable changes:
 o Add libwrap support to supfilesrv, conditioned by #ifdef LIBWRAP
   (on by default). <bouyer@@netbsd.org>
 o Renamed '-l' (the 'live' mode) to '-d' and '-l' is now used to
   enable logging of successfull connections. <bouyer@@netbsd.org>
 o Don't botch varargs: the are not always an array of void * in the stack...
   Write a separate function to convert a list of function parameters to
   explain why execv failed. <christos@@netbsd.org>
 o When in compress mode, don't overwrite the destination file directly,
   write a temp file and use rename when it is done. (From James Mathiesen
   <james@@deshaw.com>)
 o Rename errno variable to error to avoid collision with errno.h and remove
   explicit extern of errno (we get it from errno.h) <mycroft@@netbsd.org>
 o Cleanup unsigned char vs. char
 o Add -u flag, that prevents sup from attempting to restore a and m times
   on the received files.
 o Replace the provided read_line function with calls to the fparseln function
   in libutil.  Maintain compatibility on machines without fparseln through
   the NEED_READ_LINE define.
 o Rename login() to suplogin() to avoid name collition in util.h
 o If rmdir() fails, chmod the path to have r/w/x perms and run "rm -rf"
 o avoid last.temp filename collision by using rel-suffix
 o When creating directories, make sure you remove previous non-directories
   before doing so, otherwise sup fails.
 o Add -q flag to supscan for quiet operation.

log
@This merges in the latest NetBSD sup source.
- removed $Log: ...$ tags to not waste space in the repository
- now doesn't segfault on the alpha!

Note:
To compile sup on systems other than *BSD, you'll need a copy of
vis.c, vis.h, daemon.c, and sys/cdefs.h.  At least the first two
(for OSF/1).

From NetBSD changelog description (for credit where due):
.... 1996/12/23 19:42:05  christos
- add missing prototypes.
- fix function call inconsistencies
- fix int <-> long and pointer conversions
It should run now on 64 bit machines...

....  1996/12/31 18:08:00  christos
64 bit patches (mostly long -> time_t) from Matthew Jacob (?)
sup now works on the alpha!
