@Instead of every command resolving the target (-t or -s) itself, prepare
the state (client, session, winlink, pane) for it it before entering the
command. Each command provides some flags that tell the prepare step
what it is expecting.

This is a requirement for having hooks on commands (for example, if you
hook "select-window -t1:2", the hook command should to operate on window
1:2 not whatever it thinks is the current window), and should allow some
other target improvements.

The old cmd_find_* functions remain for the moment but that layer will
be dropped later.

Joint work with Thomas Adam.

@Instead of setting up the default keys by building the key struct
directly with a helper function in the cmd_entry, include a table of
bind-key commands and pass them through the command parser and a
temporary cmd_q.

As well as being smaller, this will allow default bindings to be command
sequences which will probably be needed soon.

@Add a command queue to standardize and simplify commands that call other
commands and allow a command to block execution of subsequent
commands. This allows run-shell and if-shell to be synchronous which has
been much requested.

Each client has a default command queue and commands are consumed one at
a time from it. A command may suspend execution from the queue by
returning CMD_RETURN_WAIT and then resume it by calling cmd_continue() -
for example run-shell does this from the callback that is fired after
the job is freed.

When the command queue becomes empty, command clients are automatically
exited (unless attaching). A callback is also fired - this is used for
nested commands in, for example, if-shell which can block execution of
the client's cmdq until a new cmdq becomes empty.

Also merge all the old error/info/print functions together and lose the
old curclient/cmdclient distinction - a cmdq is bound to one client (or
none if in the configuration file), this is a command client if
c->session is NULL otherwise an attached client.

@Clean up and simplify tmux command argument parsing.

Originally, tmux commands were parsed in the client process into a
struct with the command data which was then serialised and sent to the
server to be executed. The parsing was later moved into the server (an
argv was sent from the client), but the parse step and intermediate
struct was kept.

This change removes that struct and the separate parse step. Argument
parsing and printing is now common to all commands (in arguments.c) with
each command left with just an optional check function (to validate the
arguments at parse time), the exec function and a function to set up any
key bindings (renamed from the old init function).

This is overall more simple and consistent.

There should be no changes to any commands behaviour or syntax although
as this touches every command please watch for any unexpected changes.

@Make all messages sent between the client and server fixed size.

This is the first of two changes to make the protocol more resilient and less
sensitive to other changes in the code, particularly with commands. The client
now packs argv into a buffer and sends it to the server for parsing, rather
than doing it itself and sending the parsed command data.

As a side-effect this also removes a lot of now-unused command marshalling
code.

Mixing a server without this change and a client with or vice versa will cause
tmux to hang or crash, please ensure that tmux is entirely killed before
upgrading.

@Improved layout code.

Each window now has a tree of layout cells associated with it. In this tree,
each node is either a horizontal or vertical cell containing a list of other
cells running from left-to-right or top-to-bottom, or a leaf cell which is
associated with a pane.

The major functional changes are:

- panes may now be split arbitrarily both horizontally (splitw -h, C-b %) and
  vertically (splitw -v, C-b ");
- panes may be resized both horizontally and vertically (resizep -L/-R/-U/-D,
  bound to C-b left/right/up/down and C-b M-left/right/up/down);
- layouts are now applied and then may be modified by resizing or splitting
  panes, rather than being fixed and reapplied when the window is resized or
  panes are added;
- manual-vertical layout is no longer necessary, and active-only layout is gone
  (but may return in future);
- the main-pane layouts now reduce the size of the main pane to fit all panes
  if possible.

Thanks to all who tested.
