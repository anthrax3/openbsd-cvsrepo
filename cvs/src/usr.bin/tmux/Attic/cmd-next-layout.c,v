@Now that parsing is common, merge some of the small, related commands
together to use the same code.

Also add some arguments (such as -n and -p) to some commands to match
existing commands.

@Clean up and simplify tmux command argument parsing.

Originally, tmux commands were parsed in the client process into a
struct with the command data which was then serialised and sent to the
server to be executed. The parsing was later moved into the server (an
argv was sent from the client), but the parse step and intermediate
struct was kept.

This change removes that struct and the separate parse step. Argument
parsing and printing is now common to all commands (in arguments.c) with
each command left with just an optional check function (to validate the
arguments at parse time), the exec function and a function to set up any
key bindings (renamed from the old init function).

This is overall more simple and consistent.

There should be no changes to any commands behaviour or syntax although
as this touches every command please watch for any unexpected changes.

@Make all messages sent between the client and server fixed size.

This is the first of two changes to make the protocol more resilient and less
sensitive to other changes in the code, particularly with commands. The client
now packs argv into a buffer and sends it to the server for parsing, rather
than doing it itself and sending the parsed command data.

As a side-effect this also removes a lot of now-unused command marshalling
code.

Mixing a server without this change and a client with or vice versa will cause
tmux to hang or crash, please ensure that tmux is entirely killed before
upgrading.

@Improved layout code.

Each window now has a tree of layout cells associated with it. In this tree,
each node is either a horizontal or vertical cell containing a list of other
cells running from left-to-right or top-to-bottom, or a leaf cell which is
associated with a pane.

The major functional changes are:

- panes may now be split arbitrarily both horizontally (splitw -h, C-b %) and
  vertically (splitw -v, C-b ");
- panes may be resized both horizontally and vertically (resizep -L/-R/-U/-D,
  bound to C-b left/right/up/down and C-b M-left/right/up/down);
- layouts are now applied and then may be modified by resizing or splitting
  panes, rather than being fixed and reapplied when the window is resized or
  panes are added;
- manual-vertical layout is no longer necessary, and active-only layout is gone
  (but may return in future);
- the main-pane layouts now reduce the size of the main pane to fit all panes
  if possible.

Thanks to all who tested.

@Having fixed flags for single-character getopt options is a bit hard to
maintain and is only going to get worse as more are used. So instead, add a new
uint64_t member to cmd_entry which is a bitmask of upper and lowercase options
accepted by the command.

This means new single character options can be used without the need to add it
explicitly to the list.
