@Trying to do hooks generically is way too complicated and unreliable and
confusing, particularly trying to automatically figure out what target
hooks should be using. So simplify it:

- drop before hooks entirely, they don't seem to be very useful;

- commands with special requirements now fire their own after hook (for
  example, if they change session or window, or if they have -t and -s
  and need to choose which one the hook uses as current target);

- commands with no special requirements can have the CMD_AFTERHOOK flag
  added and they will use the -t state.

At the moment new-session, new-window, split-window fire their own hook,
and display-message uses the flag. The remaining commands still need to
be looked at.

@Some improvements and bug fixes for hooks:

- Prepare the state again before the "after" hooks are run, because the
  command may have killed or moved windows.

- Use the hooks list from the newly prepared target, not the old hooks
  list (only matters for new-session really).

- Correctly detect an invalid current state and ignore it in
  cmd_find_target ("killw; swapw").

- Change neww, new, killp, killw, splitw, swapp, swapw to update the
  current state (used if no explicit target is given) to something more
  useful after they have finished. For example, neww changes it to the
  newly created window.

Hooks are still relatively new and primitive so there are likely to be
more changes to come.

Parts based on bug reports from Uwe Werler and Iblis Lin.

@Instead of every command resolving the target (-t or -s) itself, prepare
the state (client, session, winlink, pane) for it it before entering the
command. Each command provides some flags that tell the prepare step
what it is expecting.

This is a requirement for having hooks on commands (for example, if you
hook "select-window -t1:2", the hook command should to operate on window
1:2 not whatever it thinks is the current window), and should allow some
other target improvements.

The old cmd_find_* functions remain for the moment but that layer will
be dropped later.

Joint work with Thomas Adam.

mark the source pane and then change to the target pane to run swapp or

@Add a command queue to standardize and simplify commands that call other
commands and allow a command to block execution of subsequent
commands. This allows run-shell and if-shell to be synchronous which has
been much requested.

Each client has a default command queue and commands are consumed one at
a time from it. A command may suspend execution from the queue by
returning CMD_RETURN_WAIT and then resume it by calling cmd_continue() -
for example run-shell does this from the callback that is fired after
the job is freed.

When the command queue becomes empty, command clients are automatically
exited (unless attaching). A callback is also fired - this is used for
nested commands in, for example, if-shell which can block execution of
the client's cmdq until a new cmdq becomes empty.

Also merge all the old error/info/print functions together and lose the
old curclient/cmdclient distinction - a cmdq is bound to one client (or
none if in the configuration file), this is a command client if
c->session is NULL otherwise an attached client.

@Clean up and simplify tmux command argument parsing.

Originally, tmux commands were parsed in the client process into a
struct with the command data which was then serialised and sent to the
server to be executed. The parsing was later moved into the server (an
argv was sent from the client), but the parse step and intermediate
struct was kept.

This change removes that struct and the separate parse step. Argument
parsing and printing is now common to all commands (in arguments.c) with
each command left with just an optional check function (to validate the
arguments at parse time), the exec function and a function to set up any
key bindings (renamed from the old init function).

This is overall more simple and consistent.

There should be no changes to any commands behaviour or syntax although
as this touches every command please watch for any unexpected changes.

@Make all messages sent between the client and server fixed size.

This is the first of two changes to make the protocol more resilient and less
sensitive to other changes in the code, particularly with commands. The client
now packs argv into a buffer and sends it to the server for parsing, rather
than doing it itself and sending the parsed command data.

As a side-effect this also removes a lot of now-unused command marshalling
code.

Mixing a server without this change and a client with or vice versa will cause
tmux to hang or crash, please ensure that tmux is entirely killed before
upgrading.

log
@Having fixed flags for single-character getopt options is a bit hard to
maintain and is only going to get worse as more are used. So instead, add a new
uint64_t member to cmd_entry which is a bitmask of upper and lowercase options
accepted by the command.

This means new single character options can be used without the need to add it
explicitly to the list.
