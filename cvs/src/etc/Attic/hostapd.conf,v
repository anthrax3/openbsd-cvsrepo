@some IAPP implementations still use the pre-standard port 2313 in broadcast
mode (tested with the HP ProCurve 420wl). add a note to the manual page and

@implement a way to match IEEE 802.11 flooding. this will help to detect
known DoS attacks, like de-auth flooding against wireless networks.
an example is provided in the manual page.
