@Major update to sensorsd.

Improves support for both 'smart' (those providing sensor status) and
'old-style' sensors.

Due to re-design, the following improvements are now present and many
flaws are now gone:


== for smart sensors ==

* automatically monitor all sensors that provide status by themselves,
  with the possibility to ignore certain individual sensors or sensors
  of certain type (appropriate template for sensorsd.conf is included)

* report actual sensor status as provided by the driver. Previously,
  WARN, CRITICAL and UNKNOWN statuses were considered the same, but
  now they are different and will be reported separately. This also
  improves readability of the log-files and consistency with sysctl
  output.

* ability to ignore status provided by the driver with the 'istatus'
  keyword ("ignore automatic status" or "I set the status"), with the
  possibility to set your own settings for acceptable limits.
  Previously, it was not possible to set any kind of user limits for
  those sensors that had their own status facilities.


== for old-style sensors ==

* previously, lm(4)-style fans that were flagged SENSOR_FINVALID during
  sensorsd startup were completely ignored, but now their invalid status
  is appropriately reported, and they are monitored again when they come
  out of their invalid mode

* previously, a sensor that had an empty entry in the configuration file
  was reported to be "within limits", but now it will not be monitored
  at all (unless, of cause, it provides its own status)


As a bonus, sensorsd syslog entries should now be shorter, and the
majority of them will fit on one line on 80-column terminals.
