@Remove dead 2004 link to list of blacklists, from Sevan Janiyan.
Point at wikipedia's list of blacklists instead, some are DNS-only but there
are a few rsyncable ones in there (including a good commercial one and some
free ones).

@Alas all good things come to an end. The U of A traplist is going away as
the University of Alberta moves away from running a spamd fronted MX,
so there is no more source for this traplist anymore.
