# This file contains a list of users (one per line) that may set their
# envelope "from" address to a different user via "sendmail -f".
# Common values include "majordomo", "mailman" and "www".
# In other words, if a daemon (or mailing list manager) sends mail purporting
# to be from a different user, the user it runs as should be listed here.
# The users "root" and "daemon" are implicitly included in this list.
#
# This file is read only at startup or when sendmail(8) is sent SIGHUP.
