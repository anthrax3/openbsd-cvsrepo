@amiga and sun3 turned out to not be y2k+3 compliant here. Remove them, as
well as the few userland tools which were only used on these platforms.

OpenBSD/Sun3 Binary Snapshot

This FTP directory contains a binary snapshot of OpenBSD/Sun3. This
can't be considered a working, stable release yet.

The OpenBSD/sun3 port should run on the following Sun3 machines (* means
having being tested):

	Sun3/50
	Sun3/60
	Sun3/110
	Sun3/160*
	Sun3/260*

Devices currently supported include(* means having being tested):

	Intel Ether (ie), on-board* or VME
	Lance Ether (le), on-board
	SCSI (sd,st,...), on-board or VME*. Sun-2 SCSI not supported yet.
	keyboard/display console*
	serial port (ttya/ttyb) console*

Other Features:

	Generic kernel supports root on: sd[0123], ie0, le0
	Kernel debugger included (ddb)
	Runs SunOS binaries (see sparc sun shared lib notes)

There's still a lot left to do. Most of the code is borrowed from
NetBSD, and new code is being tested right now, but didn't make into
this snapshot.

To use this, all you need to do it unpack everything onto the disk that
will be used for root and usr, which can be either a real disk or some
part of your NFS server.

Don't forget to setup correct devices nodes after installing the
tarballs. Run something like:
(cd dev ; MAKEDEV std)

If you have any questions or comments about this port,or want to help,
please contact the Sun3 portmaster: <miod@@openbsd.org>

I'm sorry this port isn't in good shape to be really usable now, but it
will mature over the next few months.
Enjoy anyway!

Before using the files in this directory, you should start by
unpacking doc.shar and reading all the files it contains.
Suggested reading order is:
	doc/sun3/README
	doc/sun3/STATUS
	doc/sun3/INSTALL
	doc/sun3/SUP
	doc/sun3/BUILDING
	doc/sun3/TODO

To use this, all you need to do it unpack everything onto the
disk that will be used for root and usr, which can be either a
real disk or some part of your NFS server.

REMEMBER: run dev/MAKEDEV after you unpack things!
