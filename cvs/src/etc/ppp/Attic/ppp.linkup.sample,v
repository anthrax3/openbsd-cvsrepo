@the userland ppp(9) code goes awa.  Having too much ppp choice in the
tree results in one-true-ppp not coming into existance.  This code is
essentially un-audited and quite dangerous.

#          Example of ppp.linkup file
#
#  This file is checked when ppp establishes a connection.
#  ppp searches the labels in this file as follows:
#
#  1) The label that matches the IP number assigned to our side.
#
#  2) The label specified on the command line to ppp.
#
#  3) If no label has been found, use MYADDR if it exists.

#########################################################################

# It is no longer necessary to re-add the default route here as our
# ppp.conf route is `sticky' (see the man page).
# If you're into sound effects when the link comes up, you can run
# ``auplay'' (assuming NAS is installed and configured).
#
MYADDR:
 !bg /usr/X11R6/bin/auplay /etc/ppp/linkup.au

# If we've got 192.244.176.32 as our address, then regard peer as a gateway
# to 192.244.176.0 network.  This may also be done in ppp.conf instead.
#
192.244.176.32:
 add 192.244.176.0 0 HISADDR

#You may want to execute a script after connecting.  This script can do
# nice things such as kick off "sendmail -q", "popclient my.isp" and
# "slurp -d news".  It can be passed MYADDR, HISADDR and INTERFACE
# as arguments too - useful for informing a DNS of your assigned IP.
#
# You may also want some sound effects....
#
pmdemand:
 !bg /etc/ppp/ppp.etherup.pmdemand
 ! sh -c "cat /etc/ppp/linkup.au >/dev/audio"

# If your minimum call charge is 5 minutes, you may as well stay on
# the line for that amount of time.  If we want a 60 second subsequent
# timeout, set your timeout to 300 in ppp.conf and then do this:
#
min5minutes:
 !bg sh -c "sleep 240; pppctl -p mypassword 3000 set timeout 60"

@Import version 1.5 of ppp.

<sales>
This is a user-level ppp implementation that uses the
tun driver.  It was originally created by a Japanese
ISP.  It's now piled with features.  Check the man pages
for details.
</sales>

The sources are identical to the ones in FreeBSD, except
for the Makefile.

IP aliasing (NAT) is disabled, and can be enabled by simply
doing a ``make install'' of libalias, then rebuilding
ppp.  I'll create libalias as a port soon.
