log
@Ok turns out we still want to keep the rc_bg variable around but we need
to know which daemon cannot background themselves (actually we want to
know the opposite, but there are much more). However, it's only needed in
_rc_wait and rc.subr still does its magic without the need to add `&'.

@Add an ALRM timer to cope with 2 annoying issues in rc.d(8):
- prevent a daemon from hanging the boot
(typo in your flagsm e.g. httpd_flags=-d)
- make sure we can get the status of a backgrounded daemon instead of always
returning success

Side effect of this is that we can kill a knob! rip rc_bg :-)
Ports will need love, and a second commit is coming for that.

The diff is small yet not trivial so I am committing early in the release
process in one shot so it can easily be reverted if needed. I started working on
this during g2k16 in Cambridge then finished it in Brisbane for a2k17 where
robert@@, beck@@ and sthen@@ agreed it was the correct way to go and I should move
ahead with it post 6.1.

If you see any regression, please talk to me!

@Fix a small regression reported by nicm@@: when domainname is set but
/var/yp/binding does not exist, do _not_ try to start ypbind.

Make it possible to start ypbind the same way as the other daemons
(using ypbind_flags) while preserving the historical startup behavior.

@Switch amd and spamlogd to rc scripts and make sure that the
rc_pre() functions are returning correctly. This change
also simplyfies the changes because false || return 1 can be replaced
with false if that's the last call. thanks halex@@!
