1.2
log
@Update to xorg-docs 1.6.

As with previous version, only manual pages in section 7 are
installed for now.
More work is needed to be able to format and install the docs
that have been converted to docbook xml.

The documentation in this package is from xc/doc in the monolithic
source tree.  It is expected that most of the documentation included
here will be converted to a new format and then moved to the appropriate
package.
