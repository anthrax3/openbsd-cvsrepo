.SH SYNOPSIS
Release 6.5 and 6.6 of X Version 11 was brought to you by The X.Org Group.
Release 6.4 of X Version 11 was brought to you by The X Project Team.
.SH DESCRIPTION
The Open Group's X Project Team was created as the successor
to the X Consortium, Inc., after the X Consortium ceased operations and
transferred ownership of X11 to The Open Group. The X.Org Group
(hereinafter called "X.Org") was created as the successor to The X Project
Team after the The Open Group ceased operating The X Project Team. The

the X Window System.  X.Org operates under the corporate umbrella of The
Open Group.
.PP
The X Consortium was an independent, not-for-profit Delaware membership
corporation.  It was formed in 1993 as the successor to the MIT X
Consortium.
.PP
The X Window System was created in the mid-1980s at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology.  In 1988, MIT formed a member-funded consortium
to provide the technical and administrative leadership necessary to
support further development of the X Window System.  In 1992, MIT and
the membership decided it was in their best interests to move the
consortium out of MIT and create an independent, stand-alone organization.
All rights to the X Window System were assigned by MIT to X Consortium,
Inc. on January 1, 1994.  On December 31, 1996 the X Consortium, Inc.
closed its doors and all rights to the X Window System were assigned to
The Open Group.
