.SH NAME
X.Org, XProjectTeam \- X.Org Group information
.SH SYNOPSIS
Release 6.5 and 6.6 of X Version 11 was brought to you by The X.Org Group.
Release 6.4 of X Version 11 was brought to you by The X Project Team.
.SH DESCRIPTION
The Open Group's X Project Team was created as the successor 
to the X Consortium, Inc., after the X Consortium ceased operations and
transferred ownership of X11 to The Open Group. The X.Org Group 
(hereinafter called "X.Org") was created as the successor to The X Project 
Team after the The Open Group ceased operating The X Project Team. The 
purpose of X.Org was to foster development, evolution, and maintenance of 
the X Window System.  X.Org operates under the corporate umbrella of The 
Open Group.
.PP
The X Consortium was an independent, not-for-profit Delaware membership
corporation.  It was formed in 1993 as the successor to the MIT X 
Consortium.
.PP
The X Window System was created in the mid-1980s at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology.  In 1988, MIT formed a member-funded consortium 
to provide the technical and administrative leadership necessary to 
support further development of the X Window System.  In 1992, MIT and 
the membership decided it was in their best interests to move the 
consortium out of MIT and create an independent, stand-alone organization.  
All rights to the X Window System were assigned by MIT to X Consortium, 
Inc. on January 1, 1994.  On December 31, 1996 the X Consortium, Inc. 
closed its doors and all rights to the X Window System were assigned to 
The Open Group.
