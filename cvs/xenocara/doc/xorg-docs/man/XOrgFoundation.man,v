.SH NAME
XOrgFoundation \- X.Org Foundation information
.SH SYNOPSIS
Release 6.7 and later of X Version 11 is brought to you by the
X.Org Foundation.
.SH DESCRIPTION
The X.Org Foundation is an independent, not-for-profit 501(c)(3) charity
corporation.  It was formed in 2004 as the successor to the X.Org Group at
The Open Group. The purpose of the X.Org Foundation is to foster the
development, evolution, and maintenance of the X Window System, a
comprehensive set of vendor-neutral, system-architecture neutral,
network-transparent windowing and user interface standards. Membership
in the X.Org Foundation is free and open to anyone. The X.Org Foundation
hosts a public git repository of the source code on freedesktop.org.
.PP
The X Window System was created in the mid-1980s at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology.  In 1988, MIT formed a member-funded consortium to
provide the technical and administrative leadership necessary to support
further development of the X Window System.  In 1992, MIT and the membership
decided it was in their best interests to move the consortium out of MIT and
create an independent, stand-alone organization.  All rights to the X Window
System were assigned by MIT to X Consortium, Inc. on January 1, 1994. On
December 31, 1996 the X Consortium, Inc. closed its doors and all rights
to the X Window System were assigned to The Open Group (then known as the
Open Software Foundation).
