<title>Acknowledgement</title>
<para>
This document is the result of a great deal of hard work by a great
many people. Without Erik Fortuneâ€™s work as Architect of the X
Keyboard Extension and the longtime support of Silicon Graphics
Inc. there would not be a keyboard extension.

<para>
We gratefully thank Will Walker and George Sachs for their help and
expertise in providing some of the content for this document, and
Digital Equipment Corporation and Hewlett-Packard for allowing them
to participate in this project, and we are deeply indebted to IBM for
providing the funding to complete this library specification.
</para>
<para>
Most of all, we thank Gary Aitken and Amber J. Benson for their long
hours and late nights as ultimate authors of this specification, and
for serving as authors, document editors, and XKB protocol and
implementation reviewers. Their commitment to accuracy and completeness,
their attention to detail, their keen insight, and their good natures
when working under tremendous pressure are in some measure responsible
not only for the quality of this document, but for the quality of the
Keyboard extension itself.

This document is made available to you in modern formats such as HTML and PDF
thanks to the efforts of Matt Dew, who converted the original troff sources to
DocBook/XML and edited them into shape; Fernando Carrijo, who converted the
images to SVG format; Gaetan Nadon, who set up the formatting machinery in
the libX11 builds and performed further editing of the DocBook markup; and
Alan Coopersmith, who converted the DocBook tags to semantic markup and
cleaned up other formatting issues.
