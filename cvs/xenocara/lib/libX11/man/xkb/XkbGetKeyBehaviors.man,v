.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
.I \- dpy
connection to server
.TP
.I \- first
keycode of first key to get
.TP
.I \- num
number of keys for which behaviors are desired
.TP
.I \- xkb
Xkb description to contain the result
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
.I XkbGetKeyBehaviors 
sends a request to the server to obtain the behaviors for 
.I num 
keys on the keyboard starting with the key whose keycode is 
.I first. 
It waits for a reply and returns the behaviors in the 
.I server->behaviors 
field of 
.I xkb. 
If successful, 
.I XkbGetKeyBehaviors 
returns Success.

If the 
.I server 
map in the 
.I xkb 
parameter has not been allocated, 
.I XkbGetKeyBehaviors 
allocates and initializes it before obtaining the actions.

If the server does not have a compatible version of Xkb, or the Xkb extension has not been 
properly initialized, 
.I XkbGetKeyBehaviors 
returns BadAccess. If 
.I num 
is less than 1 or greater than XkbMaxKeyCount, 
.I XkbGetKeyBehaviors 
returns BadValue. If any allocation errors occur, 
.I XkbGetKeyBehaviors 
returns BadAlloc. 
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.TP 15
.B BadAccess
The Xkb extension has not been properly initialized
.TP 15
.B BadAlloc
Unable to allocate storage
.TP 15
.B BadValue
An argument is out of range
