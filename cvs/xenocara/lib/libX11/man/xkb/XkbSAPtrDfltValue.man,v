.TH XkbSAPtrDfltValue __libmansuffix__ __xorgversion__ "XKB FUNCTIONS"
.SH NAME
XkbSAPtrDfltValue \- Returns the valueXXX field of act converted to a signed int
.SH SYNOPSIS
.HP
.B int XkbSAPtrDfltValue
.BI "(\^XkbAction " "act" "\^);"
.if n .ti +5n
.if t .ti +.5i
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
.I \- act
action from which to extract group
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
Actions associated with the XkbPtrDfltAction structure change the mk_dflt_btn 
attribute of the MouseKeys control.

If the MouseKeys control is not enabled, KeyPress and KeyRelease events are 
treated as though the action is XkbSA_NoAction. Otherwise, this action changes 
the 
.I mk_dflt_btn 
attribute of the MouseKeys control.

The 
.I type 
field of the XkbPtrDfltAction structure should always be XkbSA_SetPtrDflt.

The 
.I flags 
field is composed of the bitwise inclusive OR of the values shown in Table 1 
(currently there is only one value defined).

.TS
c s
l l
l lw(4i).
Table 1 Pointer Default Flags
_
Flag	Meaning
_
XkbSA_DfltBtnAbsolute	T{
If set, the value field represents an absolute pointer button. Otherwise, the 
value field represents the amount to be added to the current default button.
T}
.TE

The 
.I affect 
field specifies what changes as a result of this action. The only valid value 
for the 
.I affect 
field is XkbSA_AffectDfltBtn.

The 
.I valueXXX 
field is a signed character that represents the new button value for the
.I mk_dflt_btn 
attribute of the MouseKeys control. If XkbSA_DfltBtnAbsolute is set in 
.I flags, valueXXX 
specifies the button to be used; otherwise, 
.I valueXXX 
specifies the amount to be added to the current default button. In either case, 
illegal button choices are wrapped back around into range. Xkb provides macros, 
to convert between the integer and signed character values in XkbPtrDfltAction 
structures.

.I XkbSAPtrDfltValue 
returns the 
.I valueXXX 
field of 
.I act 
converted to a signed int. 
.SH STRUCTURES
