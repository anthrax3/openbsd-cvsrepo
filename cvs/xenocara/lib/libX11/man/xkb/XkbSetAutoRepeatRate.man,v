.TH XkbSetAutoRepeatRate __libmansuffix__ __xorgversion__ "XKB FUNCTIONS"
.SH NAME
XkbSetAutoRepeatRate \- Sets the attributes of the RepeatKeys control for a 
keyboard device
.SH SYNOPSIS

.BI "unsigned int " "device_spec" "\^,"
.BI "unsigned int " "timeout" "\^,"
.BI "unsigned int " "interval" "\^);"
.if n .ti +5n
.if t .ti +.5i
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
.I \- display
connection to X server
.TP
.I \- device_spec
device to configure, or XkbUseCoreKbd
.TP
.I \- timeout
initial delay, ms
.TP
.I \- interval
delay between repeats, ms
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The core protocol allows only control over whether or not the entire keyboard or 
individual keys should auto-repeat when held down. RepeatKeys is a boolean 
control that extends this capability by adding control over the delay until a 
key begins to repeat and the rate at which it repeats. RepeatKeys is coupled 
with the core auto-repeat control: when RepeatKeys is enabled or disabled, the 
core auto-repeat is enabled or disabled and vice versa.

Auto-repeating keys are controlled by two attributes. The first, 
.I timeout, 
is the delay after the initial press of an auto-repeating key and the first 
generated repeat event. The second, 
.I interval, 
is the delay between all subsequent generated repeat events. As with all boolean 
controls, configuring the attributes that determine how the control operates 
does not automatically enable the control as a whole.

.I XkbSetAutoRepeatRate 
sends a request to the X server to configure the AutoRepeat control attributes 
to the values specified in 
.I timeout 
and 
.I interval.
 
.I XkbSetAutoRepeatRate 
does not wait for a reply; it normally returns True. Specifying a zero value for 
either 
.I timeout 
or 
.I interval 
causes the server to generate a BadValue protocol error. If a compatible version 
of the Xkb extension is not available in the server, 
.I XkbSetAutoRepeatRate 
returns False.
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
.TP 15
True
The 
.I XkbSetAutoRepeatRate 
function returns True normally.
.TP 15
False
The 
.I XkbSetAutoRepeatRate 
function returns False if a compatible version of the Xkb extension is not 
available in the server.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.TP 15
.B BadValue
An argument is out of range
