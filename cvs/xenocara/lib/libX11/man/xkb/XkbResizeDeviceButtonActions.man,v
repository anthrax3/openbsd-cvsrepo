.TH XkbResizeDeviceButtonActions __libmansuffix__ __xorgversion__ "XKB FUNCTIONS"
.SH NAME
XkbResizeDeviceButtonActions \- Allocate additional space for button actions in an XkbDeviceInfoRec structure
.SH SYNOPSIS
.HP
.B Status XkbResizeDeviceButtonActions
.BI "(\^XkbDeviceInfoPtr " "device_info" "\^,"
.BI "unsigned int " "new_total" "\^);"
.if n .ti +5n
.if t .ti +.5i
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
.I \- device_info
structure in which to allocate button actions
.TP
.I \- new_total
new total number of button actions needed
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
.I XkbResizeDeviceButtonActions 
reallocates space, if necessary, to make sure there is room for a total of
.I new_total 
button actions in the 
.I device_info 
structure. Any new entries allocated are zeroed. If successful,
.I XkbResizeDeviceButtonActions 
returns Success. If 
.I new_total 
is zero, all button actions are deleted, 
.I device_info->num_btns 
is set to zero, and 
.I device_info->btn_acts 
is set to NULL. If 
.I device_info 
is invalid or 
.I new_total 
is greater than 255, BadValue is returned. If a memory allocation failure occurs, a BadAlloc is returned. 

To free an XkbDeviceInfoRec structure, use 
.I XkbFreeDeviceInfo.
.SH STRUCTURES
.LP
Information about X Input Extension devices is transferred between a client program and the Xkb 
extension in an XkbDeviceInfoRec structure:
.nf

    typedef struct {
        char *               name;          /\(** name for device */
        Atom                 type;          /\(** name for class of devices */
        unsigned short       device_spec;   /\(** device of interest */
        Bool                 has_own_state; /\(** True=>this device has its own state */
        unsigned short       supported;     /\(** bits indicating supported capabilities */
        unsigned short       unsupported;   /\(** bits indicating unsupported capabilities */
        unsigned short       num_btns;      /\(** number of entries in btn_acts */
        XkbAction *          btn_acts;      /\(** button actions */
        unsigned short       sz_leds;       /\(** total number of entries in LEDs vector */
        unsigned short       num_leds;      /\(** number of valid entries in LEDs vector */
        unsigned short       dflt_kbd_fb;   /\(** input extension ID of default (core kbd) indicator */
        unsigned short       dflt_led_fb;   /\(** input extension ID of default indicator feedback */
        XkbDeviceLedInfoPtr  leds;          /\(** LED descriptions */
    } XkbDeviceInfoRec, *XkbDeviceInfoPtr;
