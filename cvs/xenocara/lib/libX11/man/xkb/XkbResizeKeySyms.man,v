.TH XkbResizeKeySyms __libmansuffix__ __xorgversion__ "XKB FUNCTIONS"
.SH NAME
XkbResizeKeySyms \- Change the number of symbols bound to a key
.SH SYNOPSIS
.HP
.B KeySym * XkbResizeKeySyms
.BI "(\^XkbDescRec *" "xkb" "\^,"
.BI "int " "key" "\^,"
.BI "int " "needed" "\^);"
.if n .ti +5n
.if t .ti +.5i
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
.I \- xkb
keyboard description to be changed
.TP
.I \- key
keycode for key to modify
.TP
.I \- needed
new number of keysyms required for key
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
.I XkbResizeKeySyms 
reserves the space needed for 
.I needed 
keysyms and returns a pointer to the beginning of the new array that holds the 
keysyms. It adjusts the 
.I offset 
field of the 
.I key_sym_map 
entry for the key if necessary and can also change the 
.I syms, num_syms, 
and 
.I size_syms 
fields of 
.I xkb->map 
if it is necessary to reallocate the 
.I syms 
array. 
.I XkbResizeKeySyms 
does not modify either the width or number of groups associated with the key.

If 
.I needed 
is greater than the current number of keysyms for the key, 
.I XkbResizeKeySyms 
initializes all new keysyms in the array to NoSymbol.

Because the number of symbols needed by a key is normally computed as width * 
number of groups, and 
.I XkbResizeKeySyms 
does not modify either the width or number of groups for the key, a discrepancy 
exists upon return from 
.I XkbResizeKeySyms 
between the space allocated for the keysyms and the number required. The unused 
entries in the list of symbols returned by 
.I XkbResizeKeySyms 
are not preserved across future calls to any of the map editing functions, so 
you must update the key symbol mapping (which updates the width and number of 
groups for the key) before calling another allocator function. A call to
.I XkbChangeTypesOfKey 
will update the mapping.

If any allocation errors occur while resizing the number of symbols bound to the 
key, 
.I XkbResizeKeySyms 
returns NULL.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR XkbChangeTypesOfKey (__libmansuffix__),
.BR XkbResizeKeyActions (__libmansuffix__)
.SH NOTES
.LP
A change to the number of symbols bound to a key should be accompanied by a 
change in the number of actions bound to a key. Refer to XkbResizeKeyActions for 
more information on changing the number of actions bound to a key.
