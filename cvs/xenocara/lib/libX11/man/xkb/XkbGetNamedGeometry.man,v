.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
It is also possible to load a keyboard geometry by name. The X server maintains 
a database 
of keyboard components (see below).

.I XkbGetNamedGeometry 
can return BadName if the name cannot be found.

The X server maintains a database of keyboard components, identified by 
component type. 
The database contains all the information necessary to build a complete keyboard 
description for a particular device, as well as to assemble partial 
descriptions. Table 1 identifies the component types and the type of information 
they contain.

.TE

While a keymap is a database entry for a complete keyboard description, and 
therefore 
logically different from the individual component database entries, the rules 
for 
processing keymap entries are identical to those for the individual components. 
In the 
discussion that follows, the term component is used to refer to either 
individual 
components or a keymap.

There may be multiple entries for each of the component types. An entry may be 
either
.I complete 
or 
.I partial. 
Partial entries describe only a piece of the corresponding keyboard component 
and are 
designed to be combined with other entries of the same type to form a complete 
entry.

For example, a partial symbols map might describe the differences between a 
common ASCII 
keyboard and some national layout. Such a partial map is not useful on its own 
because it 
does not include those symbols that are the same on both the ASCII and national 
layouts 
(such as function keys). On the other hand, this partial map can be used to 
configure 
.I any 
ASCII keyboard to use a national layout.

When a keyboard description is built, the components are processed in the order 
in which 
they appear in Table 1; later definitions override earlier ones.
