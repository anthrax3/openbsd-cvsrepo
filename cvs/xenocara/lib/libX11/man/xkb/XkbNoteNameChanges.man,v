types of names for which changes are to be noted
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
When your application receives a XkbNamesNotify event, you can note the changed 
names in a changes structure using 
.I XkbNoteNameChanges.

The 
.I wanted 
parameter is the bitwise inclusive OR of the valid names mask bits shown in 
Table 1. 
.I XkbNoteNameChanges 
copies any changes that are reported in 
.I new 
and specified in 
.I wanted 
into the changes record specified by 
.I old.
