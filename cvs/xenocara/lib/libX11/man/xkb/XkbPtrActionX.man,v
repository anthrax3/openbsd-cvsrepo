.TH XkbPtrActionX __libmansuffix__ __xorgversion__ "XKB FUNCTIONS"
.SH NAME
XkbPtrActionX \- Returns the high_XXX and low_XXX fields of act converted to a 
signed int
.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
Actions associated with the XkbPtrAction structure move the pointer when keys 
are pressed and released.

If the MouseKeys control is not enabled, KeyPress and KeyRelease events are 
treated as though the action is XkbSA_NoAction.

If the MouseKeys control is enabled, a server action of type XkbSA_MovePtr 
instructs the server to generate core pointer MotionNotify events rather than 
the usual KeyPress event, and the corresponding KeyRelease event disables any 
mouse keys timers that were created as a result of handling the XkbSA_MovePtr 
action.

The 
.I type 
field of the XkbPtrAction structure is always XkbSA_MovePtr.

The 
.I flags 
field is a bitwise inclusive OR of the masks shown in Table 1.

Table 1 Pointer Action Types
_
Action Type	Meaning
_
XkbSA_NoAcceleration	T{
If not set, and the MouseKeysAccel control is enabled, the KeyPress initiates a 
mouse keys timer for this key; every time the timer expires, the cursor moves.
T}
XkbSA_MoveAbsoluteX	T{
If set, the X portion of the structure specifies the new pointer X coordinate. 
Otherwise, the X portion is added to the current pointer X coordinate to 
determine the new pointer X coordinate.
T}
XkbSA_MoveAbsoluteY	T{
If set, the Y portion of the structure specifies the new pointer Y coordinate. 
Otherwise, the Y portion is added to the current pointer Y coordinate to 
determine the new pointer Y coordinate.
T}
.TE

Each of the X and Y coordinates of the XkbPtrAction structure is composed of
two signed 16-bit values, that is, the X coordinate is composed of 
.I high_XXX 
and 
.I low_XXX, 
and similarly for the Y coordinate. Xkb provides the following macros, to 
convert between a signed integer and two signed 16-bit values in XkbPtrAction 
structures.
.SH STRUCTURES

    typedef struct _XkbPtrAction {
        unsigned char    type;         /\(** XkbSA_MovePtr */
        unsigned char    flags;        /\(** determines type of pointer motion */
        unsigned char    high_XXX;     /\(** x coordinate, high bits*/
        unsigned char    low_XXX;      /\(** y coordinate, low bits */
        unsigned char    high_YYY;     /\(** x coordinate, high bits */
        unsigned char    low_YYY;      /\(** y coordinate, low bits */
    } XkbPtrAction;
