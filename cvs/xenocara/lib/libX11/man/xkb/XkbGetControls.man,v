.TH XkbGetControls __libmansuffix__ __xorgversion__ "XKB FUNCTIONS"
.SH NAME
XkbGetControls \- Finds the current state of Xkb server controls
.SH SYNOPSIS
.HP
.B Status XkbGetControls
.BI "(\^Display *" "display" "\^,"
.BI "unsigned long " "which" "\^,"
.BI "XkbDescPtr " "xkb" "\^);"

.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
.I \- display

.TP
.I \- which
mask of controls requested
.TP
.I \- xkb
keyboard description for controls information
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
.I XkbGetControls 
queries the server for the requested control information, waits for a reply, and 
then copies the server's values for the requested information into the 
.I ctrls 
structure of the 
.I xkb 
argument. Only those components specified by the 
.I which 
parameter are copied. Valid values for 
.I which 
are any combination of the masks listed in Table 1 that have "ok" in the
.I which 
column.

Table 1 shows the actual values for the individual mask bits used to select 
controls for 
modification and to enable and disable the control. Note that the same mask bit 
is used to 
specify general modifications to the parameters used to configure the control 
(which), and to 
enable and disable the control (enabled_ctrls). The anomalies in Table 1 (no 
"ok" in column) 
are for controls that have no configurable attributes; and for controls that are 
not boolean 
controls and therefore cannot be enabled or disabled.

.TE


If 
.I xkb->ctrls 
is NULL, 
.I XkbGetControls 
allocates and initializes it before obtaining the values specified by 
.I which. 
If 
.I xkb->ctrls 
is not NULL, 
.I XkbGetControls 
modifies only those portions of 
.I xkb->ctrls 
corresponding to the values specified by 
.I which.

.I XkbGetControls 
returns Success if successful; otherwise, it returns BadAlloc if it cannot 
obtain sufficient storage, BadMatch if 
.I xkb 
is NULL or 
.I which 
is empty, or BadImplementation.

To free the 
.I ctrls 
member of a keyboard description, use 
.I XkbFreeControls.

The 
.I num_groups 
field in the 
.I ctrls 
structure is always filled in by 
.I XkbGetControls, 
regardless of which bits are selected by 
.I which.
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
.TP 15
Success
The 
.I XkbGetControls 
function returns Success if successful.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.TP 15
.B BadAlloc
Unable to allocate storage
.TP 15
.B BadImplementation
Invalid reply from server
.TP 15
.B BadMatch
A compatible version of Xkb was not available in the server or an argument has 
correct type and range, but is otherwise invalid
