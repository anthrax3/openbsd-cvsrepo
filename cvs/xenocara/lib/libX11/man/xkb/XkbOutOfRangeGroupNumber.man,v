.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
.I XkbOutOfRangeGroupNumber 
returns the out-of-range group number, represented as a group index, from the
.I group_info 
field of an XkbSymMapRec structure.

The 
.I group_info 
field of an XkbSymMapRec is an encoded value containing the number of groups of 
symbols bound to the 
key as well as the specification of the treatment of out-of-range groups. It is 
legal for a key to 
have zero groups, in which case it also has zero symbols and all events from 
that key yield NoSymbol. 
To obtain the number of groups of symbols bound to the key, use 
.I XkbKeyNumGroups. 
To change the number of groups bound to a key, use 
.I XkbChangeTypesOfKey. 
To obtain a mask that determines the treatment of out-of-range groups, use
.I XkbKeyGroupInfo 
and 
.I XkbOutOfRangeGroupInfo.

The keyboard controls contain a 
.I groups_wrap 
field specifying the handling of illegal groups on a global basis. That is, when 
the user performs an 
action causing the effective group to go out of the legal range, the 
.I groups_wrap 
field specifies how to normalize the effective keyboard group to a group that is 
legal for the 
keyboard as a whole, but there is no guarantee that the normalized group will be 
within the range of 
legal groups for any individual key. The per-key 
.I group_info 
field specifies how a key treats a legal effective group if the key does not 
have a type specified for 
the group of concern. For example, the Enter key usually has just one group 
defined. If the user 
performs an action causing the global keyboard group to change to Group2, the 
.I group_info 
field for the Enter key describes how to handle this situation.

Out-of-range groups for individual keys are mapped to a legal group using the 
same options as are used 
for the overall keyboard group. The particular type of mapping used is 
controlled by the bits set in 
the 
.I group_info 
flag, as shown in Table 1.
