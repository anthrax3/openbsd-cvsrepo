.TH XkbKeySymsOffset __libmansuffix__ __xorgversion__ "XKB FUNCTIONS"
.SH NAME
XkbKeySymsOffset \- Returns the offset of the two-dimensional array of keysyms 
for the key corresponding to 
.I keycode
.SH SYNOPSIS
.HP
.B int XkbKeySymsOffset
.BI "(\^XkbDescPtr " "xkb" "\^,"
.BI "KeyCode " "keycode" "\^);"
.if n .ti +5n
.if t .ti +.5i
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
.I \- xkb
Xkb description of interest
.TP
.I \- keycode
keycode of interest
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The key width and number of groups associated with a key are used to form a 
small two-dimensional array of KeySyms for a key. This array may be different 
sizes for different keys. The array for a single key is stored as a linear list, 
in row-major order. The arrays for all of the keys are stored in the 
.I syms 
field of the client map. There is one row for each group associated with a key 
and one column for each level. The index corresponding to a given group and 
shift level is computed as:
.nf

     idx = group_index * key_width + shift_level
     
.fi
The 
.I offset 
field of the 
.I key_sym_map 
entry for a key is used to access the beginning of the array.

.I XkbKeySymsOffset 
returns the offset of the two-dimensional array of keysyms for the key 
corresponding to 
.I keycode.
