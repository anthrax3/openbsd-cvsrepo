.TH XkbNoteDeviceChanges __libmansuffix__ __xorgversion__ "XKB FUNCTIONS"
.SH NAME
XkbNoteDeviceChanges \- Note device changes reported in an XkbExtensionDeviceNotify event
.SH SYNOPSIS
.HP
.B void XkbNoteDeviceChanges
.BI "(\^XkbDeviceChangesPtr " "old" "\^,"
.BI "XkbExtensionDeviceNotifyEvent *" "new" "\^,"
.BI "unsigned int " "wanted" "\^);"
.if n .ti +5n

.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
.I \- old
structure tracking state changes
.TP
.I \- new
event indicating state changes
.TP
.I \- wanted
mask indicating changes to note
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The 
.I wanted 
field specifies the changes that should be noted in 
.I old, 
and is composed of the bitwise inclusive OR of one or more of the masks from Table 1. The
.I reason 
field of the event in 
.I new 
indicates the types of changes the event is reporting. 
.I XkbNoteDeviceChanges 
updates the XkbDeviceChangesRec specified by 
.I old 
with the changes that are both specified in 
.I wanted 
and contained in 
.I new->reason.

To update a local copy of the state and configuration of an X input extension device with the changes 
previously noted in an XkbDeviceChangesRec structure, use
.I XkbGetDeviceInfoChanges.
.SH STRUCTURES
.LP
Changes to an Xkb extension device may be tracked by listening to XkbDeviceExtensionNotify events and 
accumulating the changes in an XkbDeviceChangesRec structure. The changes noted in the structure may 
then be used in subsequent operations to update either a server configuration or a local copy of an 
Xkb extension device configuration. The changes structure is defined as follows:
.nf

typedef struct _XkbDeviceChanges {
    unsigned int         changed;       /\(** bits indicating what has changed */
    unsigned short       first_btn;     /\(** number of first button which changed, if any */
    unsigned short       num_btns;      /\(** number of buttons that have changed */
    XkbDeviceLedChangesRec leds;
} XkbDeviceChangesRec,*XkbDeviceChangesPtr;
