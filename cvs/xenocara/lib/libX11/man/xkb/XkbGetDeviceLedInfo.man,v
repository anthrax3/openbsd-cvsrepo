.TH XkbGetDeviceLedInfo __libmansuffix__ __xorgversion__ "XKB FUNCTIONS"
.SH NAME
XkbGetDeviceLedInfo \- Query the indicator names, maps, and state associated 
with an LED feedback of an input extension device
.SH SYNOPSIS
.HP
.B Status XkbGetDeviceLedInfo
.BI "(\^Display *" "dpy" "\^,"
.BI "XkbDeviceInfoPtr " "device_info" "\^,"
.BI "unsigned int " "led_class" "\^,"
.BI "unsigned int " "led_id" "\^,"
.BI "unsigned int " "which" "\^);"
.if n .ti +5n
.if t .ti +.5i
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
.I \- dpy
connection to X server
.TP
.I \- device_info
structure to update with results
.TP
.I \- led_class
LED feedback class assigned by input extension
.TP
.I \- led_id
LED feedback ID assigned by input extension
.TP
.I \- which
mask indicating desired information
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
.I XkbGetDeviceLedInfo 
queries the server for the desired LED information for the feedback specified by
.I led_class 
and 
.I led_id 
for the X input extension device indicated by 
.I device_spec->device_info 
and waits for a reply. If successful, 
.I XkbGetDeviceLedInfo 
backfills the relevant fields of 
.I device_info 
as determined by 
.I which 
with the results and returns Success. Valid values for 
.I which 
are the inclusive OR of any of XkbXI_IndicatorNamesMask, 
XkbXI_IndicatorMapsMask, and XkbXI_IndicatorStateMask.

The fields of 
.I device_info 
that are filled in when this request succeeds are 
.I name, type, supported, 
and 
.I unsupported, 
and portions of the 
.I leds 
structure corresponding to 
.I led_class 
and 
.I led_id 
as indicated by the bits set in 
.I which. 
The 
.I device_info->leds 
vector is allocated if necessary and 
.I sz_leds 
and 
.I num_leds 
filled in. The 
.I led_class, led_id 
and 
.I phys_indicators 
fields of the 
.I device_info->leds 
entry corresponding to 
.I led_class 
and 
.I led_id 
are always filled in. 

If 
.I which 
contains XkbXI_IndicatorNamesMask, the 
.I names_present 
and 
.I names 
fields of the 
.I device_info->leds 
structure corresponding to 
.I led_class 
and 
.I led_id 
are updated, if 
.I which 
contains XkbXI_IndicatorStateMask, the corresponding 
.I state 
field is updated, and if 
.I which 
contains XkbXI_IndicatorMapsMask, the 
.I maps_present 
and 
.I maps 
fields are updated.

If a compatible version of Xkb is not available in the server or the Xkb 
extension has not been properly initialized, 
.I XkbGetDeviceLedInfo 
returns BadAccess. If allocation errors occur, a BadAlloc status is returned. If 
the device has no indicators, a BadMatch error is returned. If 
.I ledClass 
or 
.I ledID 
have illegal values, a BadValue error is returned. If they have legal values but 
do not specify a feedback that contains LEDs and is associated with the 
specified device, a BadMatch error is returned. 
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.TP 15
.B BadAccess
The Xkb extension has not been properly initialized
.TP 15
.B BadAlloc
Unable to allocate storage
.TP 15
.B BadMatch
A compatible version of Xkb was not available in the server or an argument has 
correct type and range, but is otherwise invalid
.TP 15
.B BadValue
An argument is out of range
