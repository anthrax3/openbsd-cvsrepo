.TH XkbChangeDeviceInfo __libmansuffix__ __xorgversion__ "XKB FUNCTIONS"
.SH NAME
XkbChangeDeviceInfo \- Update the server's description of a device with the changes noted in an 
XkbDeviceChangesRec
.SH SYNOPSIS
.HP
.B Bool XkbChangeDeviceInfo
.BI "(\^Display *" "dpy" "\^,"
.BI "XkbDeviceInfoPtr " "device_info" "\^,"
.BI "XkbDeviceChangesPtr " "changes" "\^);"
.if n .ti +5n
.if t .ti +.5i
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
.I \- dpy
connection to X server
.TP
.I \- device_info
local copy of device state and configuration
.TP
.I \- changes
note specifying changes in device_info
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
.I XkbChangeDeviceInfo 
updates the server's description of the device specified in 
.I device_info->device_spec 
with the changes specified in 
.I changes 
and contained in 
.I device_info. 
The update is made by an 
.I XkbSetDeviceInfo 
request.
.SH STRUCTURES
.LP
Changes to an Xkb extension device may be tracked by listening to XkbDeviceExtensionNotify events 
and accumulating the changes in an XkbDeviceChangesRec structure. The changes noted in the 
structure may then be used in subsequent operations to update either a server configuration or a 
local copy of an Xkb extension device configuration. The changes structure is defined as follows:
.nf

typedef struct _XkbDeviceChanges {
    unsigned int         changed;        /\(** bits indicating what has changed */
    unsigned short       first_btn;      /\(** number of first button which changed, if any */
    unsigned short       num_btns;       /\(** number of buttons that have changed */
    XkbDeviceLedChangesRec leds;
} XkbDeviceChangesRec,*XkbDeviceChangesPtr;
