.if n .ti +5n

.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
.I \- xkb
keyboard description to be changed
.TP
.I \- key
keycode for key of interest
.TP
.I \- n_groups
new number of groups for key
.TP

indices for new groups specified in groups
.TP
.I \- p_changes
notes changes made to xkb
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
.I XkbChangeTypesOfKey 
reallocates the symbols and actions bound to the key, if necessary, and 
initializes any new symbols 
or actions to NoSymbol or NoAction, as appropriate. If the p_changes parameter 
is not NULL, 
.I XkbChangeTypesOfKey 
adds the XkbKeySymsMask to the changes field of 
.I p_changes 
and modifies the 
.I first_key_sym 
and 
.I num_key_syms 
fields of 
.I p_changes 
to include the 
.I key 
that was changed. See STRUCTURE for more information on the XkbMapChangesPtr 
structure. If 
successful, 
.I XkbChangeTypesOfKey 
returns Success.

The 
.I n_groups 
parameter specifies the new number of groups for the key. The 
.I groups 
parameter is a mask specifying the groups for which new types are supplied and 
is a bitwise 
inclusive OR of the following masks: XkbGroup1Mask, XkbGroup2Mask, 
XkbGroup3Mask, and XkbGroup4Mask.

The 
.I new_types_in 
parameter is an integer array of length 
.I n_groups. 
Each entry represents the type to use for the associated group and is an index 
into 
.I xkb->map->types. 
The 
.I new_types_in 
array is indexed by group index; if 
.I n_groups 
is four and 
.I groups 
only has Group1Mask and Group3Mask set, 
.I new_types_in 
looks like this:
.nf

    new_types_in[0] = type for Group1
    new_types_in[1] = ignored
    new_types_in[2] = type for Group3
    new_types_in[3] = ignored
    
.fi    
For convenience, Xkb provides the following constants to use as indices to the 
groups:

.TS
c s
l l
l l.
Table 1 Group Index Constants
_
Constant Name	Value
_
XkbGroup1Index	0
XkbGroup2Index	1
XkbGroup3Index	2
XkbGroup4Index	3
.TE

If the Xkb extension has not been properly initialized, 
.I XkbChangeTypesOfKey 
returns BadAccess. If the 
.I xkb 
parameter it not valid (that is, it is NULL or it does not contain a valid 
client map), 
.I XkbChangeTypesOfKey 
returns BadMatch. If the 
.I key 
is not a valid keycode, 
.I n_groups 
is greater than XkbNumKbdGroups, or the 
.I groups 
mask does not contain any of the valid group mask bits, 
.I XkbChangeTypesOfKey 
returns BadValue. If it is necessary to resize the key symbols or key actions 
arrays and any 
allocation errors occur, 
.I XkbChangeTypesOfKey 
returns BadAlloc.
.SH STRUCTURES
.LP
Use the XkbMapChangesRec structure to identify and track partial modifications 
to the mapping 
components and to reduce the amount of traffic between the server and clients.
