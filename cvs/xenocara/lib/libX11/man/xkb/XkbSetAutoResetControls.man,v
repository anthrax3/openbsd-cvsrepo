.TH XkbSetAutoResetControls __libmansuffix__ __xorgversion__ "XKB FUNCTIONS"
.SH NAME
XkbSetAutoResetControls \- Changes the current values of the AutoReset control 
attributes
.SH SYNOPSIS
.HP
.B Bool XkbSetAutoResetControls
.BI "(\^Display *" "dpy" "\^,"
.BI "unsigned int " "changes" "\^,"
.BI "unsigned int *" "auto_ctrls" "\^,"
.BI "unsigned int *" "auto_values" "\^);"
.if n .ti +5n
.if t .ti +.5i
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
.I \- dpy
connection to X server
.TP
.I \- changes
controls for which to change auto-reset values
.TP
.I \- auto_ctrls
controls from changes that should auto reset 
.TP
.I \- auto_values
1 bit => auto-reset on
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
.I XkbSetAutoResetControls 
changes the auto-reset status and associated auto-reset values for the controls 
selected by 
.I changes. 
For any control selected by 
.I changes, 
if the corresponding bit is set in 
.I auto_ctrls, 
the control is configured to auto-reset when the client exits. If the 
corresponding bit in 
.I auto_values 
is on, the control is turned on when the client exits; if zero, the control is 
turned off when the client exits. For any control selected by 
.I changes, 
if the corresponding bit is not set in 
.I auto_ctrls, 
the control is configured to not reset when the client exits. 

For example:

.nf
To leave the auto-reset controls for StickyKeys the way they are:

	ok = XkbSetAutoResetControls(dpy, 0, 0, 0);
	
To change the auto-reset controls so that StickyKeys are unaffected when the 
client exits:

	ok = XkbSetAutoResetControls(dpy, XkbStickyKeysMask, 0, 0);
	
To change the auto-reset controls so that StickyKeys are turned off when the 
client exits:

	ok = XkbSetAutoResetControls(dpy, XkbStickyKeysMask, XkbStickyKeysMask, 0);
	
To change the auto-reset controls so that StickyKeys are turned on when the 
client exits:

	ok = XkbSetAutoResetControls(dpy, XkbStickyKeysMask, XkbStickyKeysMask, 
XkbStickyKeysMask);

.fi
.I XkbSetAutoResetControls 
backfills 
.I auto_ctrls 
and 
.I auto_values 
with the auto-reset controls for this particular client. Note that all of the 
bits are valid in the returned values, not just the ones selected in the 
.I changes 
mask.
