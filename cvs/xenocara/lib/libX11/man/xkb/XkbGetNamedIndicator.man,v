.TH XkbGetNamedIndicator __libmansuffix__ __xorgversion__ "XKB FUNCTIONS"

XkbGetNamedIndicator \- Look up the indicator map and other information for an 
indicator by name

.BI "unsigned int " "dev_spec" "\^,"
.BI "Atom " "name" "\^,"

.BI "Bool *" "real_rtrn" "\^);"
.if n .ti +5n
.if t .ti +.5i
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
.I \- dpy
connection to the X server 
.TP
.I \- dev_spec
keyboard device ID, or XkbUseCoreKbd
.TP
.I \- name
name of the indicator to be retrieved
.TP
.I \- ndx_rtrn
backfilled with the index of the retrieved indicator
.TP
.I \- state_rtrn
backfilled with the current state of the retrieved indicator
.TP
.I \- map_rtrn
 backfilled with the mapping for the retrieved indicator 
.TP
.I \- real_rtrn
backfilled with True if the named indicator is real (physical)
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
Xkb also allows applications to refer to indicators by name. Use 
.I XkbGetNames 
to get the indicator names. Using names eliminates the need for hard-coding 
bitmask values for particular keyboards. For example, instead of using 
vendor-specific constants such as WSKBLed_ScrollLock mask on Digital 
workstations or XLED_SCROLL_LOCK on Sun workstations, you can instead use
.I XkbGetNamedIndicator 
to look up information on the indicator named "Scroll Lock." 

If the device specified by 
.I device_spec 
has an indicator named 
.I name, XkbGetNamedIndicator 
returns True and populates the rest of the parameters with information about the 
indicator. Otherwise, 
.I XkbGetNamedIndicator 
returns False.

The 
.I ndx_rtrn 
field returns the zero-based index of the named indicator. This index is the bit 
position to use in any function call that requires a mask of indicator bits, as 
well as the indicator's index into the XkbIndicatorRec array of indicator maps. 
.I state_rtrn 
returns the current state of the named indicator (True = on, False = off). 
.I map_rtrn 
returns the indicator map for the named indicator. In addition, if the indicator 
is mapped to a physical LED, the 
.I real_rtrn 
parameter is set to True.

Each of the "
.I _rtrn
" arguments is optional; you can pass NULL for any unneeded "
.I _rtrn
" arguments.
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
.TP 15
True
The 
.I XkbGetNamedIndicator 
function returns True if the device specified by 
.I device_spec 
has an indicator named 
.I name.
.TP 15
False
The 
.I XkbGetNamedIndicator 
function returns False if the device specified by 
.I device_spec 
does not have an indicator named 
.I name.
