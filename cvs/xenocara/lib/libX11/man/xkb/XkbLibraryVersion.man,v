.TH XkbLibraryVersion __libmansuffix__ __xorgversion__ "XKB FUNCTIONS"
.SH NAME
XkbLibraryVersion \-  Determines the compatibility of a library at runtime.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.HP
.B Bool XkbLibraryVersion
.BI "(\^int *" "lib_major_in_out" "\^,"
.BI "int *" "lib_minor_in_out" "\^);"
.if n .ti +5n
.if t .ti +.5i
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
.I lib_major_in_out
Specifies and returns the major Xkb library version.
.TP
.I lib_minor_in_out
Specifies and returns the minor Xkb library version.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
If an application is dynamically linked, both the X server and the client-side X 
library must contain the Xkb extension in order for the client to use the Xkb 
extension capabilities. Therefore a dynamically linked application must check 
both the library and the server for compatibility before using Xkb function 
calls. A properly written program must check for compatibility between the 
version of the Xkb library that is dynamically loaded and the one used when the 
application was built. It must then check the server version for compatibility 
with the version of Xkb in the library.

If your application is statically linked, you must still check for server 
compatibility and may check library compatibility. (It is possible to compile 
against one set of header files and link against a different, incompatible, 
version of the library, although this should not normally occur.)

Pass the symbolic value XkbMajorVersion in 
.I lib_major_in_out 
and XkbMinorVersion in 
.I lib_minor_in_out. 
These arguments represent the version of the library used 
at compile time. The 
.I XkbLibraryVersion 
function backfills the major and minor version numbers of the library used at 
run time in 
.I lib_major_in_out and 
.I lib_minor_in_out. 
If the versions of the compile time and run time libraries are 
compatible, 
.I XkbLibraryVersion 
returns True, otherwise, it returns False.

In addition, in order to use the Xkb extension, you must ensure that the 
extension is present in the server and that the server supports the version of 
the extension expected by the client. Use 
.I XkbQueryExtension 
to do this, as described in the next section.
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
.TP 15
True
The 
.I XkbLibraryVersion 
returns True if the versions of the compile time and run time libraries are 
compatible.
.TP 15
False
The 
.I XkbLibraryVersion 
returns False if the versions of the compile time and run time libraries are not 
compatible.
