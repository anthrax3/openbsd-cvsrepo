.TH XMapWindow __libmansuffix__ __xorgversion__ "XLIB FUNCTIONS"
.SH NAME
XMapWindow, XMapRaised, XMapSubwindows \- map windows
.SH SYNTAX
.HP
int XMapWindow\^(\^Display *\fIdisplay\fP\^, Window \fIw\fP\^); 
.HP
int XMapRaised\^(\^Display *\fIdisplay\fP\^, Window \fIw\fP\^); 
.HP
int XMapSubwindows\^(\^Display *\fIdisplay\fP\^, Window \fIw\fP\^); 
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP \fIdisplay\fP 1i
Specifies the connection to the X server.
.IP \fIw\fP 1i
Specifies the window.
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.ZN XMapWindow
function
maps the window and all of its
subwindows that have had map requests.
Mapping a window that has an unmapped ancestor does not display the
window but marks it as eligible for display when the ancestor becomes
mapped.
Such a window is called unviewable.
When all its ancestors are mapped,
the window becomes viewable
and will be visible on the screen if it is not obscured by another window.
This function has no effect if the window is already mapped.
.LP
If the override-redirect of the window is
.ZN False 
and if some other client has selected
.ZN SubstructureRedirectMask
on the parent window, then the X server generates a
.ZN MapRequest
event, and the
.ZN XMapWindow
function does not map the window.
Otherwise, the window is mapped, and the X server generates a
.ZN MapNotify
event.
.LP
If the window becomes viewable and no earlier contents for it are remembered,
the X server tiles the window with its background.
If the window's background is undefined,
the existing screen contents are not
altered, and the X server generates zero or more 
.ZN Expose
events.
If backing-store was maintained while the window was unmapped, no 
.ZN Expose
events
are generated.
If backing-store will now be maintained, 
a full-window exposure is always generated.
Otherwise, only visible regions may be reported.
Similar tiling and exposure take place for any newly viewable inferiors.
.LP
.IN "XMapWindow"
If the window is an
.ZN InputOutput 
window,
.ZN XMapWindow
generates 
.ZN Expose 
events on each 
.ZN InputOutput
window that it causes to be displayed.
If the client maps and paints the window 
and if the client begins processing events, 
the window is painted twice.
To avoid this,
first ask for 
.ZN Expose 
events and then map the window,
so the client processes input events as usual.
The event list will include 
.ZN Expose 
for each
window that has appeared on the screen. 
The client's normal response to
an 
.ZN Expose 
event should be to repaint the window.
This method usually leads to simpler programs and to proper interaction
with window managers.
.LP
.ZN XMapWindow
can generate a
.ZN BadWindow 
error.
.LP
The
.ZN XMapRaised
function
essentially is similar to
.ZN XMapWindow
in that it maps the window and all of its
subwindows that have had map requests.
However, it also raises the specified window to the top of the stack.
.LP
.ZN XMapRaised
can generate a
.ZN BadWindow 
error.
.LP
The
.ZN XMapSubwindows
.IN "XMapSubwindows"
function maps all subwindows for a specified window in top-to-bottom stacking 
order.
The X server generates
.ZN Expose
events on each newly displayed window.
This may be much more efficient than mapping many windows
one at a time because the server needs to perform much of the work
only once, for all of the windows, rather than for each window.
.LP
.ZN XMapSubwindows
can generate a
.ZN BadWindow 
error.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.TP 1i
.ZN BadWindow
A value for a Window argument does not name a defined Window.
