Many thanks go to Ralph Swick (Project Athena / Digital) who has
contributed much time and effort to this widget set.  Previous
versions of the widget set are largely due to his time and effort.
Many of the improvements that I have been able to make are because he
provided a solid foundation to build upon.  While much of the effort
has been Ralph's, many other people have contributed to the code.

While not much remains of the X10 toolkit, many of the ideas for this
widget set come from that original version.  The design and
implementation of the X10 toolkit were done by:

Putting this manual together was a major task in and of itself.  I
would like to thank Ralph Swick, Donna Converse, and Jim Fulton for
taking the time to help convert my technical knowledge into legible
text.  A special thanks to Jean Diaz (O'Reilly and Associates) for
spending nearly a month with me working out all the annoying little
details.
