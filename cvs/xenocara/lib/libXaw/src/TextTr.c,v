/* INTERNATIONALIZATION:

The OMRON R5 contrib added the following action to the old TextTr:

	Ctrl<Key>backslash:	reconnect-im()

This is needed when the im is killed or otherwise becomes unreachable.
This keystroke is evil (inconvenient, hard-to-remember, not obvious)
so I am adding one more translation:

	<Key>Kanji:		reconnect-im()

The Japanese user typically hits their Kanji key when they want to do
input.  This merely makes sure the input is connected.
