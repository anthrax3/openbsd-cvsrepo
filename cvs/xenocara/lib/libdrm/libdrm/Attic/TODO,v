@De-autoconf libdrm.

Now that xenocara has been made clean with respect to using kernel headers
instead of those provided with libdrm, remove the copy of the headers included
here. Since it is now very simple, move it over to using standard bsd makefiles
instead of autoconf.

@- Build and install the test apps by default
- Additional API for unified memory manager
  see http://dri.freedesktop.org/wiki/DriMemoryManagerDesign for proposal
- Any changes needed to enable the XvMC drivers to link against libdrm
- Header cleanup
- Unify libdrm code paths between client and server
  - drmMsg, xf86DrvMsgVerb versus vfprintf
  - drmOpenDevice tries chmod/chown if in server
  - drmOpen{,ByName} tries to load kernel module if in server
  All but the last two should probably be factored out into libdri.
