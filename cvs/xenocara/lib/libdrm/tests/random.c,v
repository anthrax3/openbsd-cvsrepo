 *
 * DESCRIPTION
 *
 * This file contains a simple, straightforward implementation of the Park
 * & Miller "Minimal Standard" PRNG [PM88, PMS93], which is a Lehmer
 * multiplicative linear congruential generator (MLCG) with a period of
 * 2^31-1.
 *
 * This implementation is intended to provide a reliable, portable PRNG
 * that is suitable for testing a hash table implementation and for
 * implementing skip lists.
 *
 * FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS
 *
 * If initial seeds are not selected randomly, two instances of the PRNG
 * can be correlated.  [Knuth81, pp. 32-33] describes a shuffling technique
 * that can eliminate this problem.
 *
 * If PRNGs are used for simulation, the period of the current
 * implementation may be too short.  [LE88] discusses methods of combining
 * MLCGs to produce much longer periods, and suggests some alternative
 * values for A and M.  [LE90 and Sch92] also provide information on
 * long-period PRNGs.
