@Merge libdrm 2.4.64.  This changes the build to using the upstream
auto* build system and installing/using a libdrm specific set of drm
headers.  Thanks to Emil Velikov for removing the GNU makeisms
upstream.

@update libdrm to 2.4.15.

This diff seems larger than it is since upstream reindented some
sources.  This updates libdrm_intel to -current (which only affect the
GEM code) and libdrm to 2.4.15.  bumping both minor versions.

Discussed with matthieu@@

@Update libdrm to 2.4.3

This is needed for us to be able to update Mesa and xf86-video-intel.
Includes a few fixes, as well as the intel bufmgr interface and the
modesetting interface (which currently errors when you check if it's
enabled).

log
@De-autoconf libdrm.

Now that xenocara has been made clean with respect to using kernel headers
instead of those provided with libdrm, remove the copy of the headers included
here. Since it is now very simple, move it over to using standard bsd makefiles
instead of autoconf.
