.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP \fIconvert_proc\fP 1i
Specifies the procedure that is to be called whenever someone requests the
current value of the selection.
.IP \fIdone_proc\fP 1i
Specifies the procedure that is called
after the requestor has received the selection or NULL if the owner is not
interested in being called back.
.IP \fIlose_selection\fP 1i
Specifies the procedure that is to be called whenever the widget has
lost selection ownership or NULL if the owner is not interested in being
called back.
.IP \fIselection\fP 1i
Specifies an atom that describes the type of the selection (for example,
.ZN XA_PRIMARY ,
.ZN XA_SECONDARY ,
or
.ZN XA_CLIPBOARD ).
.ds Ti ownership should commence or is to be relinquished
.IP \fItime\fP 1i
Specifies the timestamp that indicates when the selection \*(Ti.
.ds Wi that wishes to become the owner or to relinquish ownership
.IP \fIw\fP 1i
Specifies the widget \*(Wi.
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.ZN XtOwnSelection
function informs the \*(xI selection mechanism that a
widget believes it owns a selection.
It returns
.ZN True
if the widget has successfully become the owner and
.ZN False
otherwise.
The widget may fail to become the owner if some other widget
has asserted ownership at a time later than this widget.
Note that widgets can lose selection ownership either
because someone else asserted later ownership of the selection
or because the widget voluntarily gave up ownership of the selection.
Also note that the lose_selection procedure is not called
if the widget fails to obtain selection ownership in the first place.
.LP
The
.ZN XtOwnSelectionIncremental
procedure informs the Intrinsics incremental selection mechanism that
the specified widget wishes to own the selection. It returns
.ZN True
if the specified widget successfully becomes the selection owner or
.ZN False
otherwise. For more information about \fIselection\fP, \fItarget\fP,
and \fItime\fP, see Section 2.6 of the \fIInter-Client Communication
Conventions Manual\fP.
.LP
A widget that becomes the selection owner using
.ZN XtOwnSelectionIncremental
may use
.ZN XtDisownSelection
to relinquish selection ownership.
.LP
The
.ZN XtDisownSelection
function informs the \*(xI selection mechanism that
the specified widget is to lose ownership of the selection.
If the widget does not currently own the selection either
because it lost the selection
or because it never had the selection to begin with,
.ZN XtDisownSelection
does nothing.
.LP
After a widget has called
.ZN XtDisownSelection ,
its convert procedure is not called even if a request arrives later
with a timestamp during the period that this widget owned the selection.
However, its done procedure will be called if a conversion that started
before the call to
.ZN XtDisownSelection
finishes after the call to
.ZN XtDisownSelection .
