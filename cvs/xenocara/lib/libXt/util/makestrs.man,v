.TH MAKESTRS 1 __xorgversion__
.SH NAME
makestrs \- makes string table C source and header(s)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B makestrs [-f source] [-i includedir] [-abioptions ...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I makestrs
command creates string table C source files and headers.
If
.I -f
.I source
is not specified
.I makestrs
will read from
.IR stdin .
The C source file is always written to
.IR stdout .
.I makestrs
creates one or more C header files as specified in the source file.
The following options may be specified:
.IR -sparcabi ,
.IR -intelabi ,
.IR -functionabi ,
.IR -arrayperabi ,
and
.I -defaultabi.
.LP
.I -sparcabi
is used on SPARC platforms conforming to the SPARC
Compliance Definition, i.e. SVR4/Solaris.
.LP
.I -intelabi
is used on Intel platforms conforming to the System
V Application Binary Interface, i.e. SVR4.
.LP
.I -earlyR6abi
may be used in addition to
.I -intelabi
for situations
where the vendor wishes to maintain binary compatibility between
X11R6 public-patch 11 (and earlier) and X11R6 public-patch 12 (and later).
.LP
.I -functionabi
generates a functional abi to the string table. This
mechanism imposes a severe performance penalty and it's recommended
that you not use it.
.LP
.I -arrayperabi
results in a separate array for each string. This is
the default behavior if makestrs was compiled with -DARRAYPERSTR
(it almost never is).
.LP
.I -defaultabi
forces the generation of the "normal" string table even
if makestrs was compiled with -DARRAYPERSTR. Since makestrs is almost
never compiled with -DARRAYPERSTR this is the default behavior if
no abioptions are specified.
.LP
.I -i includedir
forces the reading of templates from the includedir instead of the local
directory. This is useful to have separate source and build directories.

.LP
In words you may have one or more #file directives. Each #file may have
one or more #table directives.
.LP
The #prefix directive determines the string that makestr will prefix
to each definition.
.LP
The #feature directive determines the string that makestr will use
for the feature-test macro, e.g. X[TM]STRINGDEFINES.
.LP
The #externref directive determines the string that makestr will use
for the extern clause, typically this will be "extern" but Motif wants
it to be "externalref"
.LP
The #externdef directive determines the string that makestr will use
for the declaration, typically this will be the null string (note that
makestrs requires a trailing space in this case, i.e. "#externdef "),
and Motif will use "externaldef(_xmstrings).
.LP
The #ctmpl directive determines the name of the file used as a template
for the C source file that is generated
.LP
Each #file <filename> directive will result in a corresponding header
file by that name containing the appropriate definitions as specified
by command line options. A single C source file containing the
declarations for the definitions in all the headers will be printed
to stdout.
.LP
The #htmpl directive determines the name of the file used as a template
for the C header file that is generated.
.LP
Each #table <tablename> directive will be processed in accordance with
the ABI. On most platforms all tables will be catenated into a single
table with the name of the first table for that file. To conform to
the Intel ABI separate tables will be generated with the names indicated.
.LP
The template files specified by the #ctmpl and #htmpl directives
are processed by copying line for line from the template file to
the appropriate output file. The line containing the string
.I <<<STRING_TABLE_GOES_HERE>>>
is not copied to the output file. The appropriate data is then
copied to the output file and then the remainder of the template
file is copied to the output file.
.SH BUGS
makestrs is not very forgiving of syntax errors. Sometimes you need
a trailing space after # directives, other times they will mess you
up. No warning messages are emitted.
