@/* The GLSL specification is not specific about how to handle a non-space
 * character separating a macro identifier from the replacement list. It says
 * only "as is standard for C++ preprocessors". GCC accepts these and warns of
 * "missing whitespace". So we'll accept these, (though we don't warn).
 *
 * Note: 'O' is intentionally omitted to leave room for "octothorpe" if we
 *       decide it should be legal to use a hash here, (in fact, hash has no
 *       legal use as the first token in a macro replacement list, but one
 *       could argue that that could still be allowed if the macro were never
 *       instantiated).
