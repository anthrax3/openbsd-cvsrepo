@Revert to Mesa 13.0.6 to hopefully address rendering issues a handful of
people have reported with xpdf/fvwm on ivy bridge with modesetting driver.

/**
 * Create a new cache object.

 * This function creates the handle necessary for all subsequent cache_*
 * functions.
 *
 * This cache provides two distinct operations:
 *
 *   o Storage and retrieval of arbitrary objects by cryptographic
 *     name (or "key").  This is provided via cache_put() and
 *     cache_get().
 *
 *   o The ability to store a key alone and check later whether the
 *     key was previously stored. This is provided via cache_put_key()
 *     and cache_has_key().
 *
 * The put_key()/has_key() operations are conceptually identical to
 * put()/get() with no data, but are provided separately to allow for
 * a more efficient implementation.
 *
 * In all cases, the keys are sequences of 20 bytes. It is anticipated
 * that callers will compute appropriate SHA-1 signatures for keys,
 * (though nothing in this implementation directly relies on how the
 * names are computed). See mesa-sha1.h and _mesa_sha1_compute for
 * assistance in computing SHA-1 signatures.
