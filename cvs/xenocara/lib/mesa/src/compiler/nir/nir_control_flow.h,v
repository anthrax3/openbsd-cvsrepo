@Revert to Mesa 13.0.6 to hopefully address rendering issues a handful of
people have reported with xpdf/fvwm on ivy bridge with modesetting driver.

/** Control flow motion.
 *
 * These functions let you take a part of a control flow list (basically
 * equivalent to a series of statement in GLSL) and "extract" it from the IR,
 * so that it's a free-floating piece of IR that can be either re-inserted
 * somewhere else or deleted entirely. A few notes on using it:
 *
 * 1. Phi nodes are considered attached to the piece of control flow that
 *    their sources come from. There are three places where phi nodes can
 *    occur, which are the three places where a block can have multiple
 *    predecessors:
 *
 *    1) After an if statement, if neither branch ends in a jump.
 *    2) After a loop, if there are multiple break's.
 *    3) At the beginning of a loop.
 *
 *    For #1, the phi node is considered to be part of the if, and for #2 and
 *    #3 the phi node is considered to be part of the loop. This allows us to
 *    keep phi's intact, but it means that phi nodes cannot be separated from
 *    the control flow they come from. For example, extracting an if without
 *    extracting all the phi nodes after it is not allowed, and neither is
 *    extracting only some of the phi nodes at the beginning of a block. It
 *    also means that extracting from the beginning of a basic block actually
 *    means extracting from the first non-phi instruction, since there's no
 *    situation where extracting phi nodes without extracting what comes
 *    before them makes any sense.
 *
 * 2. Phi node sources are guaranteed to remain valid, meaning that they still
 *    correspond one-to-one with the predecessors of the basic block they're
 *    part of. In addition, the original sources will be preserved unless they
 *    correspond to a break or continue that was deleted. However, no attempt
 *    is made to ensure that SSA form is maintained. In particular, it is
 *    *not* guaranteed that definitions of SSA values will dominate all their
 *    uses after all is said and done. Either the caller must ensure that this
 *    is the case, or it must insert extra phi nodes to restore SSA.
 *
 * 3. It is invalid to move a piece of IR with a break/continue outside of the
 *    loop it references. Doing this will result in invalid
 *    successors/predecessors and phi node sources.
 *
 * 4. It is invalid to move a piece of IR from one function implementation to
 *    another.
 *
 * 5. Extracting a control flow list will leave lots of dangling references to
 *    and from other pieces of the IR. It also leaves things in a not 100%
 *    consistent state. This means that some things (e.g. inserting
 *    instructions) might not work reliably on the extracted control flow. It
 *    also means that extracting control flow without re-inserting it or
 *    deleting it is a Bad Thing (tm).
