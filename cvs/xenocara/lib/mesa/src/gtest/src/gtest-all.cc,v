// Sometimes it's desirable to build Google Test by compiling a single file.
// This file serves this purpose.

// This line ensures that gtest.h can be compiled on its own, even
// when it's fused.
#include "gtest/gtest.h"

// The following lines pull in the real gtest *.cc files.
#include "src/gtest.cc"
