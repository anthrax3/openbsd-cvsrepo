/*
 * Input assembler needs to be able to decompose adjacency primitives
 * into something that can be understood by the rest of the pipeline.
 * The specs say that the adjacency primitives are *only* visible
 * in the geometry shader, for everything else they need to be
 * decomposed. Which in most of the cases is not an issue, because the
 * geometry shader always decomposes them for us, but without geometry
 * shader we were passing unchanged adjacency primitives to the
 * rest of the pipeline and causing crashes everywhere.
 * If geometry shader is missing and the input primitive is one of 
 * the adjacency primitives we use the code from this file to
 * decompose them into something that the rest of the pipeline can 
 * understand.
