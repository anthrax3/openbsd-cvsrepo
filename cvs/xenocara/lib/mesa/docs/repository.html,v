@Revert to Mesa 13.0.6 to hopefully address rendering issues a handful of
people have reported with xpdf/fvwm on ivy bridge with modesetting driver.

<h1>Code Repository</h1>

<p>
Mesa uses <a href="http://git-scm.com">git</a>
as its source code management system.
</p>

<p>
The master git repository is hosted on
<a href="http://www.freedesktop.org">freedesktop.org</a>.
</p>

<p>
You may access the repository either as an
<a href="#anonymous">anonymous user</a> (read-only) or as a
<a href="#developer">developer</a>
(read/write).
</p>

<p>
You may also 
<a href="http://cgit.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/"
>browse the main Mesa git repository</a> and the
<a href="http://cgit.freedesktop.org/mesa/demos"
>Mesa demos and tests git repository</a>.
</p>


<h2 id="anonymous">Anonymous git Access</h2>

<p>
To get the Mesa sources anonymously (read-only):
</p>

<ol>
<li>Install the git software on your computer if needed.<br><br>
<li>Get an initial, local copy of the repository with:
    <pre>
    git clone git://anongit.freedesktop.org/git/mesa/mesa
    </pre>
<li>Later, you can update your tree from the master repository with:
    <pre>
    git pull origin
    </pre>
<li>If you also want the Mesa demos/tests repository:
    <pre>
    git clone git://anongit.freedesktop.org/git/mesa/demos
    </pre>
</ol>


<h2 id="developer">Developer git Access</h2>

<p>
If you wish to become a Mesa developer with git-write privilege, please
follow this procedure:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Subscribe to the
<a href="http://lists.freedesktop.org/mailman/listinfo/mesa-dev">mesa-dev</a>
mailing list.
<li>Start contributing to the project by posting patches / review requests to
the mesa-dev list.  Specifically,
<ul>
<li>Use <code>git send-mail</code> to post your patches to mesa-dev.
<li>Wait for someone to review the code and give you a <code>Reviewed-by</code>
statement.
<li>You'll have to rely on another Mesa developer to push your initial patches
after they've been reviewed.
</ul>
<li>After you've demonstrated the ability to write good code and have had
a dozen or so patches accepted you can apply for an account.
<li>Occasionally, but rarely, someone may be given a git account sooner, but
only if they're being supervised by another Mesa developer at the same
organization and planning to work in a limited area of the code or on a
separate branch.
<li>To apply for an account, follow
<a href="http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/AccountRequests">these directions</a>.
It's also appreciated if you briefly describe what you intend to do (work
on a particular driver, add a new extension, etc.) in the bugzilla record.
</ol>

<p>
Once your account is established:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Get an initial, local copy of the repository with:
    <pre>
    git clone git+ssh://username@@git.freedesktop.org/git/mesa/mesa
    </pre>
    Replace <em>username</em> with your actual login name.<br><br>
<li>Later, you can update your tree from the master repository with:
    <pre>
    git pull origin
    </pre>
<li>If you also want the Mesa demos/tests repository:
    <pre>
    git clone git+ssh://username@@git.freedesktop.org/git/mesa/demos
    </pre>
</ol>


<h2>Windows Users</h2>

<p>
If you're <a href="http://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/WindowsInstall">
using git on Windows</a> you'll want to enable automatic CR/LF conversion in
your local copy of the repository:
</p>
<pre>
   git config --global core.autocrlf true
</pre>

<p>
This will cause git to convert all text files to CR+LF on checkout,
and to LF on commit.
</p>
<p>
Unix users don't need to set this option.
</p>
<br>


<h2>Development Branches</h2>

<p>
At any given time, there may be several active branches in Mesa's
repository.
Generally, the trunk contains the latest development (unstable)
code while a branch has the latest stable code.
</p>

<p>
The command <code>git-branch</code> will list all available branches.
</p>

<p>
Questions about branch status/activity should be posted to the
mesa3d-dev mailing list.
</p>

<h2>Developer Git Tips</h2>

<ol>
<li>Setting up to edit the master branch
<p>
If you try to do a pull by just saying<code> git pull </code>
and git complains that you have not specified a
branch, try:
<pre>
    git config branch.master.remote origin
    git config branch.master.merge master
</pre>
<p>
Otherwise, you have to say<code> git pull origin master </code>
each time you do a pull.
</p>
<li>Small changes to master
<p>
If you are an experienced git user working on substantial modifications,
you are probably
working on a separate branch and would rebase your branch prior to
merging with master.
But for small changes to the master branch itself,
you also need to use the rebase feature in order to avoid an
unnecessary and distracting branch in master.
</p>
<p>
If it has been awhile since you've done the initial clone, try
<pre>
    git pull
</pre>
<p>
to get the latest files before you start working.
</p>
<p>
Make your changes and use
<pre>
    git add &lt;files to commit&gt;
    git commit
</pre>
<p>
to get your changes ready to push back into the fd.o repository.
</p>
<p>
It is possible (and likely) that someone has changed master since
you did your last pull.  Even if your changes do not conflict with
their changes, git will make a fast-forward 
merge branch, branching from the point in time
where you did your last pull and merging it to a point after the other changes.
</p>
<p>
To avoid this, 
<pre>
    git pull --rebase
    git push
</pre>
<p>
If you are familiar with CVS or similar system, this is similar to doing a
<code> cvs update </code> in order to update your source tree to
the current repository state, instead of the time you did the last update.
(CVS doesn't work like git in this respect, but this is easiest way
to explain it.)
<br>
In any case, your repository now looks like you made your changes after
all the other changes.
</p>
<p>
If the rebase resulted in conflicts or changes that could affect
the proper operation of your changes, you'll need to investigate
those before doing the push.
</p>
<p>
If you want the rebase action to be the default action, then
<pre>
    git config branch.master.rebase true
    git config --global branch.autosetuprebase=always
</pre>
<p>
See <a href="http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~cduan/technical/git/">Understanding Git Conceptually</a> for a fairly clear explanation about all of this.
