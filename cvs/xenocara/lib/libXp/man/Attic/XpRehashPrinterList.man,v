.TH XpRehashPrinterList 3Xp __xorgversion__ "XPRINT FUNCTIONS"
.SH NAME
XpRehashPrinterList \- Recomputes the list of available printers.
.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
.I display
Specifies a pointer to the Display structure; returned from XOpenDisplay.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
XpRehashPrinterList causes the X Print Server to recompute (update) its list of 
available printers, and update the attributes for the printers. The intended 
usage of this routine is in a special tool that a system administrator can run 
after changing the printer topology. General applications are encouraged to use 
this call sparingly if at all, and let the system administrator control printer 
topology updates.

Depending on the print facilities underlying the X Print Server, the X Print 
Server may be able to detect changes in the printer topology and dynamically 
update to reflect the changes, or may not be able to detect the changes and will 
have to be notified via XpRehashPrinterList.
Existing print contexts will not be affected by XpRehashPrinterList as long as 
their printer destination remains valid.
