# fully.

# [Note: This script is expected to be called by the shell, which in turn
#  calls perl automatically.  The nifty start-up code above is based on
#  gnulib's `update-copyright' script; it is a more portable replacement for
#  the shebang, using the first `perl' program in the shell's path instead.]

# Usage:
#
#   update-copyright-year file1 [file2 ...]


# This script handles copyright entries like
#
#   Copyright  2000   by
#   foobar
#
# or
#
#   /* Copyright 2000,  2001, 2004-2007 by    */
#   /* foobar                                 */
#
# and replaces them uniformly with
#
#   Copyright 2000-2015
#   foobar
#
# and
#
#   /* Copyright 2000-2015 by                 */
#   /* foobar                                 */
#
# (assuming that the current year is 2015).  As can be seen, the line length
# is retained if there is non-whitespace after the word `by' on the same
# line.
