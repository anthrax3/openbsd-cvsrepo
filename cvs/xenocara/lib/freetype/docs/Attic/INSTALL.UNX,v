@This  document contains  instructions  on how  to  build the  FreeType
library on Unix  systems.  This also works for  emulations like Cygwin
or MSys on Win32:


  1. Ensure that you are using GNU Make
  -------------------------------------

    The FreeType build system  _exclusively_ works with GNU Make.  You
    will  not be  able to  compile the  library with  the instructions
    below using any other alternative (including BSD Make).

    [Well,  this  is not  really  correct.  A  few  years  ago a  perl
    implementation of make called `makepp' has appeared which can also
    build FreeType 2 successfully on Unix platforms.  See

      http://makepp.sourceforge.net

    for more  details; you  need version 1.19  or newer, and  you must
    pass option `--norc-substitution'.]

    Trying  to compile  the library  with a  different Make  tool will
    print a message like:

      Sorry, GNU make is required to build FreeType2.

    and the build  process will be aborted.  If  this happens, install
    GNU Make on your system,  and use the GNUMAKE environment variable
    to name it, if necessary.


  2. Build and install the library
  --------------------------------

    The following  should work  on all Unix  systems where  the `make'
    command invokes GNU Make:

      ./configure [options]
      make
      make install           (as root)

    The default installation path  is `/usr/local'.  It can be changed
    with the `--prefix=<path>' option.  Example:

      ./configure --prefix=/usr

    When using a different command to invoke GNU Make, use the GNUMAKE
    variable.  For example,  if `gmake' is the command  to use on your
    system, do something like:

       GNUMAKE=gmake ./configure [options]
       gmake
       gmake install            (as root)

    If  this still doesn't  work, there  must be  a problem  with your
    system (e.g., you are using a very old version of GNU Make).

    It  is possible  to  compile FreeType  in  a different  directory.
    Assuming the FreeType source  files in directory `/src/freetype' a
    compilation in directory `foo' works as follows:

      cd foo
      /src/freetype/configure [options]
      make
      make install
