Update to FreeType 2.6.3

ok sthen@@, naddy@@, matthieu@@
@
text
@This document contains instructions on how to cross-build the FreeType
library on Unix systems, for example, building binaries for Linux/MIPS
on  FreeBSD/i386.  Before  reading this  document, please  consult the
file  `INSTALL.UNIX' for  required tools  and the  basic self-building
procedure.


  1. Required Tools
  -----------------

    For self-building the FreeType library  on a Unix system, GNU Make
    3.80 or newer  is required.  `INSTALL.UNIX' contains  hints how to
    check the installed `make'.

    The GNU C  compiler to cross-build the target  system is required.
    Currently, using a non-GNU cross  compiler is untested.  The cross
    compiler is  expected to be  installed with a system  prefix.  For
    example, if  your building system  is FreeBSD/i386 and  the target
    system is Linux/MIPS, the cross  compiler should be installed with
    the name `mips-ip22-linuxelf-gcc'.

    A C  compiler for a self-build  is required also, to  build a tool
    (`apinames') that is executed during the build procedure.  Non-GNU
    self compilers are acceptable, but such a setup is untested.


  2. Configuration
  ----------------

    2.1. Building and target system

      To configure  a cross-build,  the options  `--host=<system>' and
      `--build=<system>'  must be  passed to  the `configure'  script.
      For example, if your build system is FreeBSD/i386 and the target
      system is Linux/MIPS, say

        ./configure \
          --build=i386-unknown-freebsd \
          --host=mips-ip22-linuxelf \
          [other options]

      It should  be noted that `--host=<system>'  specifies the system
      where the built binaries will  be executed, not the system where
      the build actually happens.   Older versions of GNU autoconf use
      the option  pair `--host=' and `--target='.  This  is broken and
      doesn't work.  Similarly, an explicit CC specification like

        env CC=mips-ip22-linux-gcc ./configure                 # BAD

      or

        env CC=/usr/local/mips-ip22-linux/bin/gcc ./configure  # BAD

      doesn't   work  either;  such   a  configuration   confuses  the
      `configure' script while  trying to find the cross  and native C
      compilers.


    2.2. The prefix to install FreeType2

      Setting `--prefix=<prefix>'  properly is important.   The prefix
      to  install  FreeType2  is written  into  the  `freetype-config'
      script and `freetype2.pc' configuration file.

      If  the built  FreeType  2 library  is  used as  a  part of  the
      cross-building system,  the prefix  is expected to  be different
      from  the self-building  system.  For  example, a  configuration
      with   `--prefix=/usr/local'   installs    binaries   into   the
      system-wide `/usr/local' directory, which then can't be executed
      due  to the  incorrect architecture.   This causes  confusion in
      configuration of all applications  that use FreeType2.  Instead,
      use a prefix  to install the cross-build into  a separate system
      tree, for example, `--prefix=/usr/local/mips-ip22-linux/'.

      On the other hand, if the built  FreeType 2 library is used as a
      part of the target system,  the prefix to install should reflect
      the file system structure of the target system.


    2.3. Library dependencies

      FreeType normally depends on external libraries like `libpng' or
      `libharfbuzz'.   The  easiest case  is  to  deactivate all  such
      dependencies  using the  `--without-XXX' configuration  options.
      However, if you  want to use those libraries,  you should ensure
      that  they  are available  both  on  the  target system  and  as
      (cross-compiled) libraries on the build system.

      FreeType uses  `pkg-config' to find  most of the  libraries; the
      other libraries it links to  are expected in the standard system
      directories.   Since the  default pkg-config's  meta-information
      files (like `harfbuzz.pc') of the build platform don't work, use
      one of the two possible solutions below.

        o Use pkg-config's meta-information files that are adjusted to
          cross-compile  and  cross-link  with the  target  platform's
          libraries.  Make sure those files are found before the build
          system's default files.  Example:

            ./configure \
              --build=i386-unknown-freebsd \
              --host=mips-ip22-linuxelf \
              PKG_CONFIG_LIBDIR="/usr/local/mips-ip22-linux/lib/pkgconfig" \
              [other options]

          See the manpage of `pkg-config' for more details.

        o Set variables like LIBPNG_LIBS  as additional options to the
          `configure' script, overriding the values `pkg-config' would
          provide.  `configure --help' shows the available environment
          variables.  Example:

            ./configure \
              --build=i386-unknown-freebsd \
              --host=mips-ip22-linuxelf \
              LIBPNG_CFLAGS="-I/usr/local/mips-ip22-linux/include" \
              LIBPNG_LIBS="-L/usr/local/mips-ip22-linux/lib -lpng12" \
              [other options]


  3. Building command
  -------------------

    If  the  configuration  finishes successfully,  invoking  GNU make
    builds FreeType2.  Just say

      make

    or

      gmake

    depending on the name the GNU make binary actually has.


  4. Installation
  ---------------

    Saying

      make install

    as usual to install FreeType2 into the directory tree specified by
    the argument of the `--prefix' option.

    As noted in section 2.2,  FreeType2  is sometimes configured to be
    installed  into the  system directory  of the  target  system, and
    should  not be installed  in the  cross-building system.   In such
    cases, the  make variable `DESTDIR'  is useful to change  the root
    directory in the installation.  For example, after

      make DESTDIR=/mnt/target_system_root/ install

    the built FreeType2 library files are installed into the directory
    `/mnt/target_system_root/<prefix_in_configure>/lib'.


  5. TODO
  -------

    Cross building between Cygwin (or MSys) and Unix must be tested.
