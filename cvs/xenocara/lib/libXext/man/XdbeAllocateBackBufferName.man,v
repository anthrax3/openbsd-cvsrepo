\&#include <X11/extensions/Xdbe.h>

XdbeBackBuffer XdbeAllocateBackBufferName(
    Display        *dpy,
    Window         window,
    XdbeSwapAction swap_action)
.SH DESCRIPTION
This function returns a drawable ID used to refer to the back buffer of the
specified window.  The swap_action is a hint to indicate the swap action that
will likely be used in subsequent calls to

does not have to be the same as the
swap_action passed to this function, though clients are encouraged to provide
accurate information whenever possible.
.SH ERRORS
.IP BadAlloc
.IP BadIDChoice
.IP BadMatch
The specified window is not an InputOutput window or its visual does not
support DBE.
.IP BadValue
An invalid swap action was specified.
.IP BadWindow
An invalid window was specified.

.I XdbeBeginIdiom(),
.I XdbeDeallocateBackBufferName(),
.I XdbeEndIdiom(),
