.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.PP
.ZN XShmQueryExtension
checks to see if the shared memory extensions are available for the
specified display.
.PP
.ZN XShmQueryVersion
returns the version numbers of the extension implementation. Shared
memory pixmaps are supported if the pixmaps argument returns true.
.PP
.ZN XShmAttach
tells the server to attach to your shared memory segment. If all goes
well, you will get a non-zero status, back and your XImage is ready
for use.
.PP
.ZN XShmDetach
tells the server to detach from your shared memory segment.
.PP
.ZN XShmPutImage
combines an image in memory with a shape of the specified drawable. If
XYBitmap format is used, the depth must be one, or a ``BadMatch''
error results. The foreground pixel in the GC defines the source for
the one bits in the image, and the background pixel defines the source
for the zero bits. For XYPixmap and ZPixmap, the depth must match the
depth of the drawable, or a ``BadMatch'' error results.
.PP
.ZN XShmGetImage
reads image data into a shared memory XImage where display is the
display of interest, drawable is the source drawable, image is the
destination XImage, x and y are offsets within the drawable, and
plane_mask defines which planes are to be read.
.PP
.ZN XShmCreateImage
allocates the memory needed for an XImage structure for the specified
display but does not allocate space for the image itself.
.PP
.ZN XShmPixmapFormat
gets the format for the server. If your application can deal with the
server pixmap data format, a shared memory segment and shminfo
structure are created.
.PP
.ZN XShmCreatePixmap
points to a pixmap which you can manipulate in all of the usual ways,
with the added bonus of being able to edit its contents directly
through the shared memory segment.
.PP
.ZN XShmGetEventBase
gets the completion event value.
