.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The
.I DPMSEnable
function enables Display Power Management Signaling (DPMS) on the specified
.I display.
When DPMS is enabled, DPMS will use the currently saved timeout values. It will
trigger the appropriate DPMS power level based on the timeout values. Refer to
.I DPMSSetTimeouts.
All physical screens are affected by
.I DPMSEnable
at the same time.

If
.I DPMSEnable
is invoked on a display which has DPMS already enabled, or on a display which
does not support DPMS, no change is made and no error is returned.
.SH "RETURN VALUES"

TRUE
The
.I DPMSEnable
function always returns TRUE.
