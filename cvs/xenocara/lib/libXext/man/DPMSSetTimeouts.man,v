.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The DPMSSetTimeouts function permits applications to set the timeout values
used by the X server for Display Power Management Signaling (DPMS) timings.
.LP
The value \fIstandby\fP is the amount of inactivity time, in seconds, before
standby mode is invoked. The actual
effects of this mode are dependent on the characteristics of the monitor and
frame buffer card. Standby mode is
implemented by shutting off the horizontal sync signal, and pulsing the vertical
sync signal. Standby mode
provides the quickest monitor recovery time.  Note also that many monitors
implement this mode identical to
suspend mode.  A value of zero disables the standby mode.
.LP
The value \fIsuspend\fP is the amount of time of inactivity, in seconds, before
the second level of power
savings is invoked. Suspend mode's physical and electrical characteristics are
implementation defined. For DPMS
compliant hardware, setting the suspend mode is implemented by pulsing the
horizontal sync signal and
shutting off the vertical sync signal.  In general, suspend mode recovery is
considered to be slower than
standby mode, but faster than off mode. However it may vary from monitor to
monitor.  As noted above, many
monitors implement this mode identical to the standby mode.  A value of zero
disables this mode.
.LP
The value \fIoff\fP is the amount of time of inactivity,in seconds, before the
third and final level of power
savings is invoked. Off mode's physical and electrical characteristics are
implementation defined. In DPMS
compliant hardware, it is implemented by shutting off both horizontal and
vertical sync signals, resulting in
powering down of the monitor.  Recovery time is implementation dependent.
Usually the recovery time is very
close to the power-up time of the monitor. A value of zero disables this mode.
.LP
Chronologically, \fIstandby\fP mode occurs before or simultaneously with
\fIsuspend\fP mode, and
\fIsuspend\fP mode must occur before or simultaneously with \fIoff\fP mode.
Therefore, non-zero mode timeout
values must be greater than or equal to the timeout values of earlier modes.  If
inconsistent values are
supplied, a BadValue error will result.
.SH "RETURN VALUES"

TRUE
The
.I DPMSSetTimeouts
function returns TRUE when the function has succeeded.
