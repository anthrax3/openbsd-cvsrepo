directory information
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B xft\-config

|
.BR \-\-prefix [ =\fIlocal_prefix\fR ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B xft\-config
reports information of interest to users and developers about the installed
version of the X FreeType library,
.BR Xft (3).
Depending on how it is invoked,
.B xft\-config
reports the installed version of Xft, the compiler and linker flags
that are required to successfully compile and link C (or C-compatible) code
that uses the library, and/or the directories used by the GNU Autotools to
install its files.
Note that if the system's installed version of Xft came from an OS vendor
or other third party, the actual location of its files may differ from
those reported by
.BR xft\-config .
The system adminstrator can also relocate Xft's files.
.PP
If invoked without any arguments,
.B xft\-config
will print a usage message on standard error and exit.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-\-cflags

symbols.
.TP
.BR \-\-exec\-prefix [ =\fIlocal_prefix\fR ]
If specified without the parameter
.IR local_prefix ,
report the file specification prefix that Xft uses for installation of
executable files.
If
.I local_prefix
is specified, it is used instead of the file specification prefix used for
installation of executable files by Xft and the value of the option
argument specified with

if any, when compile and linker flags are reported (with
.B \-\-cflags
and
.BR \-\-libs ,
respectively).
.TP
.B \-\-libs
Report the linker flags that are required to link code that uses Xft
symbols.
.TP
.BR \-\-prefix [ =\fIlocal_prefix\fR ]
If specified without the parameter
.IR local_prefix ,
report the file specification prefix that Xft uses for installation of
files.
If
.I local_prefix
is specified, it is used instead of the file specification prefix used for
installation of files by Xft when compile and linker flags are reported
(with
.B \-\-cflags
and
.BR \-\-libs ,
respectively); also see
.BR \-\-exec\-prefix .
.TP
.B \-\-version
Report the version of the Xft library installed on the system and exit.
