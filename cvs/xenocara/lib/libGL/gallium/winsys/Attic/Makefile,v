@Only build the gallium radeon winsys on i386/amd64 as
those are the only archs that currently use gallium radeon drivers.

It should build anywhere that has the libdrm radeon headers
installed.  And while that should really be everywhere it
isn't at the moment and won't be for release.

It isn't clear why the radeon winsys in Mesa 10.4 didn't have
the same problem.

Found the hard way by todd@@ on alpha.
