============================

NAME
----

   XSetDeviceMode - change the mode of a device

SYNOPSIS
--------

   #include <X11/extensions/XInput.h>

   XSetDeviceMode( Display *display,
                   XDevice *device,
                   int mode);

   display
          Specifies the connection to the X server.

   device
          Specifies the device whose mode is to be changed.

   mode
          Specifies the mode.You can pass Absolute,or Relative.

DESCRIPTION
-----------

   The XSetDeviceMode request changes the mode of an input device
   that is capable of reporting either absolute positional
   information or relative motion information. Not all input
   devices are capable of reporting motion data, and not all are
   capable of changing modes from Absolute to Relative.

   XSetDeviceMode can generate a BadDevice or BadMode error.

DIAGNOSTICS
-----------

   BadDevice
          An invalid device was specified. The specified device
          does not exist or has not been opened by this client via
          XOpenInputDevice. This error may also occur if some
          other client has caused the specified device to become
          the X keyboard or X pointer device via the
          XChangeKeyboardDevice or XChangePointerDevice requests.

   BadMatch
          This error may occur if an XSetDeviceMode request is
          made specifying a device that has no valuators and
          reports no axes of motion.

   BadMode
          An invalid mode was specified. This error will also be
          returned if the specified device is not capable of
          supporting the XSetDeviceMode request.
