@XGETDEVICEMODIFIERMAPPING(libmansuffix)
=======================================

NAME
----

   XGetDeviceModifierMapping, XSetDeviceModifierMapping - query or
   change device modifier mappings

SYNOPSIS
--------

   #include <X11/extensions/XInput.h>

   int XSetDeviceModifierMapping( Display *display,
                                  XDevice *device,
                                  XModifierKeymap *modmap);

   XModifierKeymap *XGetDeviceModifierMapping( Display *display,
                                               XDevice *device);

   display
          Specifies the connection to the X server.

   device
          Specifies the device whose modifier mapping is to be
          queried or modified.

   modmap
          Specifies a pointer to the XModifierKeymap structure.

DESCRIPTION
-----------

   The XSetDeviceModifierMapping request specifies the KeyCodes of
   the keys (if any) that are to be used as modifiers for the
   specified device. If it succeeds, the X server generates a
   DeviceMappingNotify event, and XSetDeviceModifierMapping
   returns MappingSuccess. X permits at most eight modifier keys.
   If more than eight are specified in the XModifierKeymap
   structure, a BadLength error results.

   The modifiermap member of the XModifierKeymap structure
   contains eight sets of max_keypermod KeyCodes, one for each
   modifier in the order Shift, Lock, Control, Mod1, Mod2, Mod3,
   Mod4, and Mod5. Only nonzero KeyCodes have meaning in each set,
   and zero KeyCodes are ignored. In addition, all of the nonzero
   KeyCodes must be in the range specified by min_keycode and
   max_keycode as returned by XListInputDevices, or a BadValue
   error results. No KeyCode may appear twice in the entire map,
   or a BadValue error results.

   An X server can impose restrictions on how modifiers can be
   changed, for example, if certain keys do not generate up
   transitions in hardware, if auto-repeat cannot be disabled on
   certain keys, or if multiple modifier keys are not supported.
   If some such restriction is violated, the status reply is
   MappingFailed, and none of the modifiers are changed. If the
   new KeyCodes specified for a modifier differ from those
   currently defined and any (current or new) keys for that
   modifier are in the logically down state,
   XSetDeviceModifierMapping returns MappingBusy, and none of the
   modifiers is changed.

   XSetDeviceModifierMapping can generate BadLength, BadDevice,
   BadMatch, BadAlloc, and BadValue errors.

   The XGetDeviceModifierMapping request returns a pointer to a
   newly created XModifierKeymap structure that contains the keys
   being used as modifiers. The structure should be freed after
   use by calling XFreeModifierMapping . If only zero values
   appear in the set for any modifier, that modifier is disabled.

   XGetDeviceModifierMapping can generate BadDevice and BadMatch
   errors.

Structures

   The XModifierKeymap structure contains:

                typedef struct {
                int max_keypermod;
                KeyCode *modifiermap;
                } XModifierKeymap;

DIAGNOSTICS
-----------

   BadLength
          More than eight keys were specified in the
          XModifierKeymap structure.

   BadAlloc
          The server failed to allocate the requested resource or
          server memory.

   BadDevice
          An invalid device was specified. The specified device
          does not exist or has not been opened by this client via
          XOpenInputDevice. This error may also occur if the
          specified device is the X keyboard or X pointer device.

   BadMatch
          This error may occur if an XGetDeviceModifierMapping or
          XChangeDeviceModifierMapping request was made specifying
          a device that has no keys.

   BadValue
          Some numeric value falls outside the range of values
          accepted by the request. Unless a specific range is
          specified for an argument, the full range defined by the
          argument's type is accepted. Any argument defined as a
          set of alternatives can generate this error.
