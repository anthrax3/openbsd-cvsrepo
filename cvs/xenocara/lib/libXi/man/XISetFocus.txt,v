@XISETFOCUS(libmansuffix)
========================

NAME
----

   XISetFocus, XIGetFocus - set or get the device's focus.

SYNOPSIS
--------

   #include <X11/extensions/XInput2.h>

   Status XISetFocus( Display *display,
                      int deviceid,
                      Window focus,
                      Time time);

   Status XIGetFocus( Display *display,
                      Window *focus_return);

   display
          Specifies the connection to the X server.

   deviceid
          Specifies the device whose focus is to be queried or
          changed.

   focus
          The new focus window.

   focus_return
          Returns the current focus window.

   time
          A valid timestamp or CurrentTime.

DESCRIPTION
-----------

   XISetFocus changes the focus of the specified device ans its
   last-focus-change time. It has no effect if the specified time
   is earlier than the current last-focus-change time or is later
   than the current X server time. Otherwise, the
   last-focus-change time is set to the specified time.
   CurrentTime is replaced by the current X server time).
   XISetFocus causes the X server to generate core, XI and XI2
   focus events.

   If the focus window is None all keyboard events by this device
   are discarded until a new focus window is set. Otherwise, if
   focus is a window, it becomes the device's focus window. If a
   generated device event would normally be reported to this
   window or one of its inferiors, the event is reported as usual.
   Otherwise, the event is reported relative to the focus window.

   The specified focus window must be viewable at the time
   XISetFocus is called, or a BadMatch error results. If the focus
   window later becomes not viewable, the focus reverts to the
   parent (or the closest viewable ancestor. When the focus
   reverts, the X server generates core, XI and XI2 focus events
   but the last-focus-change time is not affected.

   Attempting to set the focus on a master pointer device or an
   attached slave device will result in a BadDevice error.

   XISetFocus can generate BadDevice, BadMatch, BadValue, and
   BadWindow errors.

DIAGNOSTICS
-----------

   BadValue
          A value is outside of the permitted range.

   BadDevice
          An invalid device was specified. The device does not
          exist or is not a appropriate for the type of change.

   BadMatch
          The window is not viewable.

   BadWindow
          A value for a Window argument does not name a defined
          Window.
