@XIQUERYVERSION(libmansuffix)
============================

NAME
----

   XIQueryVersion - announce and query the support XI2 version.

SYNOPSIS
--------

   #include <X11/extensions/XInput2.h>

   Status XIQueryVersion( Display *display,
                          int *major_version_inout,
                          int *minor_version_inout);
   
   display
          Specifies the connection to the X server.

   major_version_inout
          Specifies the client's supported XI2 version, and
          returns the server's supported version.

   minor_version_inout
          Specifies the client's supported XI2 version, and
          returns the server's supported version.

DESCRIPTION
-----------

   XIQueryVersion announces the client's supported XI2 version to
   the server and returns server's supported X Input version. Clients 
   are required to use XIQueryVersion instead of XGetExtensionVersion 
   if they use XI2 calls. The server may treat a client differently 
   depending on the supported version announced by the client.
   The major_version_inout must be 2 or greater, otherwise a BadValue 
   error occurs.

   If the server does not support XI2, XIQueryVersion returns BadRequest 
   to the client. Otherwise, XIQueryVersion returns Success. In both 
   cases major_version_inout and minor_version_inout are set to the 
   server's supported version.

   If the client has previously called XIQueryVersion, then the result
   depends on the previously requested version and the currently
   requested version.

   If either the previous or current requested versions is less than
   2.2, or if the requested major version numbers do not match, then
   consecutive calls to XIQueryVersion by the same client always
   return the first returned major.minor version. If the client
   requests a version lower than the first returned major.minor
   version in a subsequent call, a BadValue error occurs.

   If all of the requested versions are 2.2 or greater, then
   consecutive calls to XIQueryVersion by the same client with the
   same major version will return the requested version, but the server
   will operate according to the highest requested version number or
   the highest supported version, whichever is lower.

   XIQueryVersion can generate a BadValue error.

EXAMPLES
--------

        int rc;
        int major = 2;
        int minor = 0;

        rc = XIQueryVersion(dpy, &major, &minor);
        if (rc == Success)
            printf("XI2 supported. (%d.%d)\n", major, minor);
        else if (rc == BadRequest)
            printf("No XI2 support. (%d.%d only)\n", major, minor);
        else
            printf("Internal error\n");

DIAGNOSTICS
-----------

   BadValue
          A value is outside of the permitted range.
