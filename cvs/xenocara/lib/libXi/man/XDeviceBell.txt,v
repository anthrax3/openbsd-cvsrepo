NAME
----

   XDeviceBell - ring a bell on a device supported through the
   input extension

SYNOPSIS
--------

   #include <X11/extensions/XInput.h>

   Status XDeviceBell( Display *display,
                       XDevice *device,
                       XID feedbackclass,
                       XID feedbackid,
                       int percent);
   display
          Specifies the connection to the X server.

   device
          Specifies the device with which the bell is associated.

   feedbackclass
          Specifies the class of the feedback with which the bell
          is associated.

   feedbackid
          Specifies the id of the feedback with which the bell is
          associated.

   percent
          Specifies the volume in the range -100 to 100 at which
          the bell should be rung.

DESCRIPTION
-----------

   The XDeviceBell request causes the server to ring a bell on the
   specified feedback of the specified device, if possible. The
   specified volume is relative to the base volume for the bell.
   If an invalid device is specified, a BadDevice error will be
   returned. The feedbackclass and feedbackid parameters contain
   values returned by an XGetFeedbackControl request and uniquely
   identify the bell to ring. If a feedbackclass is specified that
   does not support a bell, or if a nonexistent feedbackid is
   specified, or a percent value is specified that is not in the
   range -100 to 100, a BadValue error will be returned.

   The volume at which the bell is rung when the percent argument
   is nonnegative is: base - [(base * percent) / 100] + percent

   The volume at which the bell rings when the percent argument is
   negative is: base + [(base * percent) / 100]

   To change the base volume of the bell, use
   XChangeFeedbackControl.

   XDeviceBell can generate a BadDevice or a BadValue error.

DIAGNOSTICS
-----------

   BadDevice
          An invalid device was specified. The specified device
          does not exist, or has not been opened by this client
          via XOpenInputDevice.

   BadValue
          An invalid feedbackclass, feedbackid, or percent value
          was specified.
