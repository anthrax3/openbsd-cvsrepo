@XISETCLIENTPOINTER(libmansuffix)
================================

NAME
----

   XISetClientPointer, XIGetClientPointer - set or get the
   ClientPointer device.

SYNOPSIS
--------

   #include <X11/extensions/XInput2.h>

   XISetClientPointer( Display *display,
                       Window win,
                       int deviceid);
   
   Bool XIGetClientPointer( Display *display,
                            Window win,
                            int *device);

   display
          Specifies the connection to the X server.

   win
          Specifies a window belonging to the client. May be None.

   deviceid
          Specifies the ClientPointer device.

DESCRIPTION
-----------

   The ClientPointer is the device that is percieved to be the
   core pointer for non-XI protocol requests and replies. Each
   time a protocol message needs device-dependent data and the
   device is not explicitly given, the ClientPointer device is
   used to obtain the data. For example, a XQueryPointer request
   will return the coordinates of the ClientPointer.

   XISetClientPointer request sets the ClientPointer device for
   the client that owns the given window. If win is None, the
   requesting client's ClientPointer is set to the device
   specified with deviceid. Only master pointer devices can be set
   as ClientPointer.

   XISetClientPointer and can generate a BadDevice and a BadWindow
   error.

   The XIGetClientPointer request returns the ClientPointer's
   device ID for the client that owns the given window. If win is
   None, the requesting client's ClientPointer is returned.

   win may be a client ID instead of a window.

   XIGetClientPointer can generate a BadWindow error.

DIAGNOSTICS
-----------

   BadDevice
          An invalid device was specified. The device does not
          exist or is not a master pointer device.

   BadWindow
          A value for a Window argument does not name a defined
          window.
