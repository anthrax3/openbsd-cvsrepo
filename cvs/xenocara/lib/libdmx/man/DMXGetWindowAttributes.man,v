.SH NAME
DMXGetWindowAttributes \- determine back-end window attributes
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <X11/extensions/dmxext.h>
.sp
.nf
.BI "Bool DMXGetWindowAttributes(Display " *dpy ,
.BI "                            Window " window ,
.BI "                            int " *screen_count ,
.BI "                            int " available_count ,
.BI "                            DMXWindowAttributes " *attr );
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
When calling
.BR DMXGetWindowAttributes() ,
.I window
specifies the window ID of a window on the
.BR Xdmx (1)
server and
.I available_count
specifies the length of
.I attr.
.PP
The number of screens for which information is available will be
returned in
.I screen_count
and information about those screen will be returned in
.IR attr .
If
.I screen_count
is less than
.IR available_count ,
then information for all of the screens will be returned.  Otherwise,
information for the first
.I available_count
screens will be returned.
.PP
The
.I DMXWindowAttributes
structure is:
.sp
.nf
typedef struct {
    int          screen;
    Window       window;
    XRectangle   pos, vis;
} DMXWindowAttributes;
.fi
.PP
For each back-end X server that displays a portion of
.IR window ,
this structure contains the physical
.I screen
containing that portion, the
.I window
ID on the back-end X server of the window containing that portion, the
position and dimensions of the window on the back-end
.RI ( pos ,
in screen coordinates), and the visible area of the window on the
back-end
.RI ( vis ,
in window-relative coordinates -- all zeros if the window is not visible
on the backend).
.PP
To obtain more information about the physical screen use the
.BR DMXGetScreenAttributes (__libmansuffix__)
call.
.PP
Note that DMX allows multiple back-end windows to overlap in their
view of the DMX logical window.  Further, a logical window does not
have to be completely covered by back-end windows -- there may be
gaps.
.PP
As an example, consider a 500x500 window that spans the top two
1024x768 back-end displays (A and B) of a 2048x1536 DMX display
composed of 4 1024x768 back-end displays arranged in a cube:
.sp
.nf
    A B
    C D
.fi
.sp
In this case, the DMXGetWindowAttributes call would return the
following information for the 500x500 window:
.sp
.nf
display A: 500x500 window at 1024-250,0 (relative to back end)
           with 250x500 visible at 0,0 (relative to window origin)

display B: 500x500 window at -250,0 (relative to back end)
           with 250x500 visible at 250,0 (relative to window origin)

display C: 500x500 window at 1024-250,-768 with 0x0 visible at 0,0

display D: 500x500 window at -250,-768 with 0x0 visible at 0,0
.fi
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.B DMXGetWindowAttributes()
returns
.B True
unless there is a protocol error.
.PP
.B DMXGetWindowAttributes()
can generate
.B BadWindow
and
.B BadAlloc
errors.
.SH NOTES
Because this call transports a great deal of information over the wire,
please call
.BR DMXGetScreenCount (__libmansuffix__)
first, and make sure
.I attr
is sufficiently large.
.PP
On a particular back-end server, it is possible that the associated
window has not yet been mapped because the
.BR XMapWindow (__libmansuffix__)
call that will eventually map the window had been buffered by Xlib's
normal buffering system.  To avoid this race condition, please call
.BR DMXSync (__libmansuffix__)
before communicating directly with the back-end X server.
