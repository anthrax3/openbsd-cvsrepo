@expat is now in base, xmlwf in ports

		Added rudimentary build procedures for 
		OpenVMS based on work by Martin Vorlaender.


You'll need MMS or its freeware equivalent MMK.  Just go to the 
top-level directory and type

$ MMS/DESCRIPTION=[.vms]
 
  or

$ MMK/DESCRIPTION=[.vms]

You'll end up with the object library expat.olb.  For now, installation
consists merely of copying the object library, include files, and
documentation to a suitable location.  

To-do list:

	-- create a shareable image
	-- build and run the tests and build the xmlwf utility
	-- create an install target
