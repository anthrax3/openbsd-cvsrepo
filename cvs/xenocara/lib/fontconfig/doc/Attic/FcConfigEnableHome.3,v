@Update to fontconfig 2.10.91 + a few local fixes.
Move to a new BSD make based build system since fontconfig's build
system has become too dependant on GNU make.

Requested by ajacoutot@@, tested by many back in january.

If \fIenable\fR is FcTrue, then Fontconfig will use various

notation in the configuration). When \fIenable\fR is
FcFalse, then all use of the home directory in these contexts will be
disabled. The previous setting of the value is returned.
