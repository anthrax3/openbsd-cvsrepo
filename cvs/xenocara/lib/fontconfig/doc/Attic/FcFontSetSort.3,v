@Update to fontconfig 2.10.91 + a few local fixes.
Move to a new BSD make based build system since fontconfig's build
system has become too dependant on GNU make.

Requested by ajacoutot@@, tested by many back in january.

.SH NAME
FcFontSetSort \- Add to a font set
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fB#include <fontconfig.h>
.sp
FcFontSetSort(FcConfig *\fIconfig\fB);
(FcFontSet **\fIsets\fB);
(int\fInsets\fB);
(FcPattern *\fIpattern\fB);
(FcBool \fItrim\fB);
(FcCharSet **\fIcsp\fB);
(FcResult *\fIresult\fB);
\fR.fi
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
Returns the list of fonts from \fIsets\fR
sorted by closeness to \fIpattern\fR\&. 
If \fItrim\fR is FcTrue,
elements in the list which don't include Unicode coverage not provided by
earlier elements in the list are elided. The union of Unicode coverage of
all of the fonts is returned in \fIcsp\fR,
if \fIcsp\fR is not NULL. This function
should be called only after FcConfigSubstitute and FcDefaultSubstitute have
been called for \fIp\fR;
otherwise the results will not be correct.
.PP
The returned FcFontSet references FcPattern structures which may be shared
by the return value from multiple FcFontSort calls, applications cannot
modify these patterns. Instead, they should be passed, along with
\fIpattern\fR to
\fBFcFontRenderPrepare\fR which combines them into a complete pattern.
.PP
The FcFontSet returned by FcFontSetSort is destroyed by caling FcFontSetDestroy.
.SH "VERSION"
.PP
Fontconfig version 2.8.0
