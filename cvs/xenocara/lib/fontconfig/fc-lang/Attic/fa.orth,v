@Update to fontconfig 2.10.91 + a few local fixes.
Move to a new BSD make based build system since fontconfig's build
system has become too dependant on GNU make.

Requested by ajacoutot@@, tested by many back in january.

# We are assuming that:
# * Most fonts that claim to support an Arabic letter actually do so;
# * Most modern text rendering software use OpenType tables, instead of
#   directly using presentation forms.
# * Some good Arabic fonts do not support codepoints for Arabic presentation
#   forms.
# Thus, we are switching to general forms of Arabic letters.

0626-0628
0629 # TEH MARBUTA, implicitly considered mandatory in the official orthography
062a-063a
