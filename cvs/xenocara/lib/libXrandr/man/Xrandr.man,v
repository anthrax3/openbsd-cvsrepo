The
.B XRRScreenSize
structure contains a possible root size in pixels and in millimeters.

A
.B XRRScreenChangeNotifyEvent
is sent to a client that has requested notification whenever the screen
configuration is changed. A client can perform this request by calling
\fBXRRSelectInput\fP, passing the display, the root window, and the
\fBRRScreenChangeNotifyMask\fP mask.

.B XRRScreenConfiguration
is an opaque data type containing the configuration information
for a screen.

.B Timestamps
.PP
Time stamps are included and must be used to ensure the client is playing
with a full deck: the screen may change properties
on the fly and this ensures its knowledge of the configuration is up to date.
This is to help issues when screens may become hot-pluggable in the future.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Xrandr
is a simple library designed to interface the X Resize and Rotate
Extension.  This allows clients to change the size and rotation of the
root window of a screen, along with the ability to reflect the screen
about either axis (if supported by the implementation).  Rotation and
reflection may be implemented by software and may result in slower
performance if rotation and reflection are implemented in this fashion
(as are all implementations as of October 2002).
.PP
The Xrandr library does some minimal caching to avoid roundtrips to
provide clients frequently used information.  See "The X Resize and
Rotate Extension" for a detailed description; also note that depth
switching, as described in the document is not implemented, and may
(or may not) ever be implemented, as display memory is growing rapidly,
and toolkits are already beginning to support migration, mitigating the
need for depth switching.  If it is implemented in the future, we
expect to do so via an upward compatible extension to the
current library/protocol; functionality described here should continue
to work.
.PP
Rotation and reflection and how they interact can be confusing.  In
Randr, the coordinate system is rotated in a counter-clockwise
direction relative to the normal orientation.  Reflection is along the
window system coordinate system, not the physical screen X and Y axis,
so that rotation and reflection do not interact.  The other way to
consider reflection is to treat it as specified in the "normal"
orientation, before rotation.
.PP
The
.B XRRScreenChangeNotify
event is sent to clients that ask to be informed whenever the root window
configuration changes.  Configuration changes may include resolution,
physical size, subpixel order (see XRender(3)), and rotation.  Note
that changes to any or all of these could occur due to external events
(user control in the X server, a different monitor/flat panel display
being hot-plugged) and is not only the result of a protocol/library
request to the X server.
.PP
Additionally, to eliminate a potential race condition,
this event may be generated
immediately upon selecting for notification if the screen has changed
since the client of Xrandr connected to the X server, to enable
reliable screen resolution changing when a user may log in and
change the configuration while one or many clients are starting up.
.PP
.B Xlib notification
.PP
Clients must call back into Xlib using
.B XRRUpdateConfiguration
when screen configuration change notify events are generated
(or root window configuration changes occur, to update Xlib's
view of the resolution, size, rotation, reflection or subpixel order.
Generally, toolkits will perform this operation on behalf of applications;
we did not want to change display structure data behind the back of toolkits,
as in multithreaded clients, various race conditions might occur.
Toolkits should provide clients some mechanism for notification of
screen change, of course.

.SH FUNCTIONS
There are two classes of interfaces: those which can be safely called
even if RandR is not implemented on a screen (to make common idioms not
dependent on the server having support), and those which will return
errors if the extension is not present.
.PP
.B XRRRotations
returns both the possible set of rotations/reflections supported
(as a bitmask) as the value of the function, along with the current
rotation/reflection of the screen.
.PP
.B XRRSizes
returns the size and a pointer to the current sizes supported by
the specified screen.  The first size specified is the default size
of the server. If RandR is not supported, it returns 0 for
the number of sizes.
.PP
.B XRRRates
returns a pointer to the rates supported by the specified size.
If RandR is not supported, it returns 0 for the number of rates.
.PP
.B XRRTimes
returns the time last reported by the server along with the
timestamp the last configuration changed.
If the configuration has changed since the client last updated
its view of the server time, requests to change the configuration
will fail until the client has an up to date timestamp.
.PP
.B XRRRootToScreen
returns the screen number given a root window (for example, from
an \fBXRRScreenChangeNotifyEvent\fP).
.PP
The rest of the functions will fail if applied to screens not
implementing the RandR extension.
.B XRRSetScreenConfig
sets the screen size and rotation and reflection to the desired
values on the screen specified by \fIdraw\fP, or returns a
.B BadValue
error.
\fIsize_index\fP specifies which size configuration is to be used,
\fIrotation\fP specifies which rotation or reflection is to
be used (or a
.B BadValue
error is returned).
The \fItimestamp\fP is used by the server to make sure the client
has up to date configuration information. Status is returned
to indicate success or failure; a client must refresh its configuration
information if it fails and try the call again (by calling
\fBXRRGetScreenInfo\fP).
.PP
.B XRRSetScreenConfigAndRate
is like
.B XRRSetScreenConfig
but also sets the refresh rate. If specified rate is not supported a
.B BadValue
error is returned.
.PP
.B XRRConfigRotations,
.B XRRConfigSizes,
.B XRRConfigCurrentConfiguration,
.B XRRConfigTimes,
.B XRRConfigRates,
and
.B XRRConfigCurrentRate
are used to get specific configuration information out of a screen
configuration.
.PP
.B XRRGetScreenInfo
returns a screen configuration for later use; the information is
private to the library.
Call
.B XRRFreeScreenConfigInfo
to free this information when you are finished with it.
It forces a round trip to the server.

Other functions include:
.B XRRQueryExtension
which returns the event and error base codes,
.B XRRQueryVersion
, which returns the current version of the extension (this information
is cached by the library).
.SH RESTRICTIONS
.B Xrandr
will remain upward compatible after the current 1.0 release.
