      OVERVIEW

/********************************************************************/

     XvMC extends the X-Video extension (Xv) and makes use of the
  familar concept of the XvPort.  Ports have attributes that can be set
  and queried through Xv.  In XvMC ports can also have hardware motion
  compensation contexts created for use with them.  Ports which support
  XvImages (ie. they have an "XV_IMAGE" port encoding as described in
  the Xv version 2.2 API addendum) can be queried for the list of XvMCSurface
  types they support.  If they support any XvMCSurface types an
  XvMCContext can be created for that port.

     An XvMCContext describes the state of the motion compensation
  pipeline.  An individual XvMCContext can be created for use with
  a single port, surface type, motion compensation type, width and
  height combination.  For example, a context might be created for a
  particular port that does MPEG-2 motion compensation on 720 x 480
  4:2:0 surfaces.  Once the context is created, referencing it implies
  the port, surface type, size and the motion compensation type.  Contexts
  may be "direct" or "indirect".  For indirect contexts the X server
  renders all video using the data passed to it by the client.  For
  direct contexts the client libraries render the video with little
  or no interaction with the X server.

     XvMCSurfaces are buffers into which the motion compensation
  hardware can render.  The data in the buffers themselves are not client
  accessible and may be stored in a hardware-specific format.  Any
  number of buffers can be created for use with a particular context
  (resources permitting).

     XvMC provides video acceleration starting at one of two places
  in the video pipeline.  Acceleration starting at the first point,
  which we shall call the "Motion Compensation" level, begins after the
  the inverse quantization and IDCT at the place where motion compensation
  is to be applied.  The second point, which we shall call the "IDCT"
  level, begins before the IDCT just after the inverse quantization.

     Rendering is done by presenting the library with a target XvMCSurface
  and up to two reference XvMCSurfaces for the motion compensation, a
  buffer of 8x8 blocks and a command buffer which describes how to
  use the 8x8 blocks along with motion compensation vectors to construct
  the data in the target XvMCSurface.  When the pipeline starts at the
  IDCT level, Xv will perform the IDCT on the blocks before performing
  the motion compensation. A function is provided to copy/overlay a
  portion of the XvMCSurface to a drawable with arbitrary scaling.

    XvMCSubpictures are separate surfaces that may be blended with the
  target surface.  Any number of XvMCSubpictures may be created for use
  with a context (resources permitting).  Both "backend" and "frontend"
  subpicture behavior are supported.

                                When this is set the client is responsible
                                for painting the colorkey.

	XVMC_BACKEND_SUBPICTURE - The supicture is of the "backend"
                                  variety.  It is "frontend" otherwise.
                                  There is more information on this in the
                                  section on subpictures below.

        XVMC_INTRA_UNSIGNED - When this flag is set, the motion compenstation
                              level Intra macroblock data should be in an

                              present in the mpeg stream.  This flag applies
                              only to motion compensation level acceleration.

    This function renders the macroblocks passed to it.  It will not
    return until it has read all of the macroblocks, however, rendering
    will usually not be completed by that time.  The return of this
    function means it is safe to touch the blocks and macroblock_array.

        The target_surface is required.  If the future and past
      surfaces are NULL, the target_surface is an "Intra" frame.

      	If the past surface is provided but not the future surface,
      the target_surface is a "Predicted Inter" frame.

	If both past and future surfaces are provided, the
      target_surface is a "Bidirectionally-predicted Inter" frame.

        Specifying a future surface without a past surface results
      in a BadMatch.

      All surfaces must belong to the same context.

                                or second in the sequence.

    num_macroblocks -  The number of XvMCMacroBlock structures to execute in
                       the macroblock_array.

    first_macroblock - The index of the first XvMCMacroBlock to process in the

    blocks - The array of XvMCBlocks to be referenced by the XvMCMacroBlocks.
             The data in the individual blocks are in raster scan order and
             should be clamped to the limits specific to the acceleration
             level.  For motion compensation level acceleration this is 8
             bits for Intra and 9 bits for non-Intra data.  At the IDCT level
             this is 12 bits.

)

   The behavior of these two functions is different depending on whether
or not the XVMC_BACKEND_SUBPICTURE flag is set in the XvMCSurfaceInfo.

 XVMC_BACKEND_SUBPICTURE set:

    XvMCBlendSubpicture associates the subpicture with the target_surface.
  Both will be displayed at the next call to XvMCPutSurface.  Additional
  blends before the call to XvMCPutSurface simply overrides the association.
  Both the target_surface and subpicture will query XVMC_DISPLAYING from
  the call to XvMCPutSurface until they are no longer displaying.  It is
  safe to associate the subpicture and target_surface before rendering has
  completed (while they still query XVMC_RENDERING) but it is not safe to
  call XvMCPutSurface at that time.

    XvMCBlendSubpicture2 copies the source_surface to the target_surface
  and associates the subpicture with the target_surface.  This essentially
  calls XvMCBlendSubpicture on the target_surface after the copy.  Both
  the subpicture and target_surface will query XVMC_DISPLAYING from the
  call to XvMCPutSurface until they are no longer displaying.  The
  source_surface will not query XVMC_DISPLAYING as a result of this function.
  The copy is pipelined with the rendering and will cause XVMC_RENDERING
  to be queried until the copy is done.


 XVMC_BACKEND_SUBPICTURE not set ("frontend" behavior):

    XvMCBlendSubpicture is a no-op in this case.

    XvMCBlendSubpicture2 blends the source_surface and subpicture and
  puts it in the target_surface.  This does not effect the status of
  the source surface but will cause the target_surface to query
  XVMC_RENDERING until the blend is completed.


  display - The connection to the server.

  subpicture - The subpicture to be blended into the video.

  target_surface - The surface to be displayed with the blended subpicture.

  source_surface - Source surface prior to blending.

  subx -
  suby -
  subw -
  subh -  The rectangle from the subpicture to be blended.

  surfx -
  surfy -
  surfw -
  surfh - The rectangle in the XvMCSurface to blend the subpicture rectangle
          into.  If XVMC_SUBPICTURE_INDEPENDENT_SCALING is not set in the
          XvMCSurfaceInfo subw must be equal to surfw and subh must be
          equal to surfh height or else a BadValue error occurs.

   Errors:

    XvMCBadSurface - Any of the surfaces are invalid.

    XvMCBadSubpicture - The subpicture is invalid.

    BadMatch - The subpicture or any of the surfaces do not belong to the
               same context.

    BadValue - XVMC_SUBPICTURE_INDEPENDENT_SCALING is set and the source
               and destination rectangles are different sizes.
