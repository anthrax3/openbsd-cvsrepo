.SH NAME
xmkmf \- create a Makefile from an Imakefile
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B xmkmf
[ -a ] [
.I topdir
[
.I curdir
] ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I xmkmf
command is the normal way to create a
.I Makefile
from an
.I Imakefile
shipped with third-party software.
.PP
When invoked with no arguments in a directory containing an
.I Imakefile,
the
.I imake
program is run with arguments appropriate for your system
(configured into
.I imake
when it was built) and generates a
.I Makefile.
.PP
When invoked with the
.I \-a
option,
.I xmkmf
builds the
.I Makefile
in the current directory, and then automatically executes
``make Makefiles'' (in case there are subdirectories),
``make includes'',
and ``make depend'' for you.
.PP
If a
.I topdir
is given,
.I xmkmf
assumes nothing is installed on your system and looks for files in
the build tree instead of using the installed versions.  Optionally,
.I curdir
may be specified as a relative pathname from the top of the build
tree to the current directory.  It is necessary to supply
.I curdir
if the current directory has subdirectories, or the
.I Makefile
will not be able to build the subdirectories.
