@Post-installation instructions for X.Org on OpenBSD/loongson
------------------------------------------------------------

OpenBSD use the X.Org X server on loongson.

Currently, the X server is supported on the Lemote Yeelong and EMTEC
Gdium Liberty netbooks with a smfb(4) frame buffer. The wsfb driver
provides an unaccelerated frame buffer for use with the X server. 

No xorg.conf is needed in this configuration, unless you want to 
change default options.

To start xenodm, the X display manager, activate the xenodm_flags
option in /etc/rc.conf.local(8). You will need to disable the console
getty in /etc/ttys.

Alternatively, you can log in at the console and run `startx'.

The default /etc/X11/xorg.conf which is installed, provides a ready-to-run
configuration. Due to the current lack of dynamic object lazy binding on
OpenBSD/loongson, A few modules modules need to be force loaded.
