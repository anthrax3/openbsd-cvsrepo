@Post-installation instructions for X.Org on OpenBSD/amd64
---------------------------------------------------------

Conventions used in this document:
  - somename(1) implies that "somename" is a program, and there is a
    manual page available in section 1 of the manual pages for further
    reading, viewed by typing "man 1 somename".

1. Start either xenodm(1) or startx(1).

   a. Start xenodm(1), the X display manager by activating xenodm in 
      /etc/rc.conf.local(8):

      # rcctl enable xenodm

   b. Start startx(1) from a console shell.  It is the X script that starts
      the X server and a few X applications, including a window manager.

2. If needed, Create the configuration file for your server.

   For many users of X.Org's servers, an xorg.conf file is not needed,
   X, will automatically detect and use your hardware.

   For the few cases where your hardware is not properly autodetected
   or supported or not supported as you wish, you will have to create
   a configuration file.

   See Xorg(1) and xorg.conf(5) for details.

1. Make sure your system has support for X enabled:

   You must have "option APERTURE" in your kernel configuration and
   uncomment the line that says:

	machdep.allowaperture=2

   in /etc/sysctl.conf.  See xf86(4) for more details about security
   issues related to this.  After changing this variable in sysctl.conf,
   you will need to reboot for the change to take effect.

3.1. Note about Radeon cards.

   OpenBSD provides two versions of the X.Org driver for ATI Radeon cards.

   - radeon(4) is the (almost) current X.Org driver. It has more support for
     recent hardware, but unfortunately also exposes a few regressions,
     leading to screen corruption on some hardware, and is known not
     to work in ZapHod mode. It is selected by default.

   - radeonold(4) is an older version of the driver, which is known to
     work on most of the Radeon cards, except the newer ones. It is
     robust and also works in "ZapHod" mode (one X screen per physical
     screen). It needs to be enabled explicitly by creating a simple
     /etc/X11/xorg.conf file containing:

     Section "Device"
             Identifier "Old Radeon card"
             Driver "radeonold"
     EndSection
