OpenBSD uses the X.Org X server on alpha. 

Currently, only TGA video cards are supported.

The wsfb driver supports the TGA as a dumb framebuffer at 8 or 24 bits
per pixel, depending on the card model. 
A default /etc/X11/xorg.conf is installed that uses this driver. So
you can just use 'startx' or xdm to start X without further
configuration. 

See the tga(4) manual page for instructions on setting
the resolution of a TGA card.

Start either xdm(1) or startx(1).

   a. Start xdm(1), the X display manager by activating the xdm_flags option
      in /etc/rc.conf(8) or /etc/rc.conf.local(8).  You need to disable
      the getty process attached to /dev/ttyC0 if your video card is a TGA.

   b. Start startx(1) from a console shell.  It is the X script that starts
      the X server and a few X applications, including a window manager.

Currently, TGA video hardware as well as a few VGA cards are
supported.
a13 22
VGA cards support is available only on BWX based machines.
The following cards have been successfully tested:

* 3DFX Interactive Banshee
* 3DLabs Permedia 2 (8, 15, 16 and 24 bits depth) 
* ATI Rage Pro (works with 'Option "NoAccel"')
* ATI Rage 128
* Cirrus Logic CL5430 (works with 'Option "NoAccel"')
* Cirrus Logic GD5446 (8, 16 and 24 bits depth)
* Matrox MGA 2064 (8, 16 and 24 bits depth)

Make sure your system has support for X enabled:

You must have 'option APERTURE' in your kernel configuration and
uncomment the line that says:  

	machdep.allowaperture=1

in /etc/sysctl.conf.  See xf86(4) for more details about security
issues related to this.  After changing this variable in sysctl.conf,
you will need to reboot for the change to take effect.

A special driver reproduces the functionality of Xtga in previous
releases:  wsfb. It uses the TGA as a dumb framebuffer at 8 or 24 bits
