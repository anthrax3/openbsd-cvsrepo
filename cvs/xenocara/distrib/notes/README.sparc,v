@Post-installation instructions for X.Org on OpenBSD/sparc
---------------------------------------------------------

1. Seting up X on sparc is easy:

   Typical Xorg use on Sun sparc-based machines requires no configuration
   file.

   However, multi-headed configurations will require a configuration file.
   Create /etc/X11/xorg.conf, with these two sections for each framebuffer:

	Section "Device"
		Identifier	"Wsdisplay0"
		Driver		"wsfb"
		Option		"device"	"/dev/ttyC0"
	EndSection

	Section "Screen"
		Identifier	"Screen0"
		Device		"Wsdisplay0"
	EndSection

   This example is for the first screen. For the others, increment the
   "Wsdisplay" and "Screen" numbers, and change the device to /dev/ttyD0
   for the second display, /dev/ttyE0 for the third, and so on.

   Then, you'll need to create a ServerLayout section describing all the
   displays and their location relative to the first, as in:

	Section "ServerLayout"
		Identifier	"wsfb"
		Screen  0       "Screen0"
		Screen  1       "Screen1" RightOf "Screen0"
	EndSection

   See xorg.conf(5) for more options.

2. Start either xdm(1) or startx(1).

   a. Start xdm(1), the X display manager by activating the xdm_flags
      option in /etc/rc.conf.local(8).  It is necessary to disable
      /dev/console in /etc/ttys, change the 'status' of /dev/console
      to 'off'.

   b. Start startx(1) from a console shell.  It is the X script that starts
      the X server and a few X applications, including a window manager.

   Typical Xorg use on Sun sparc-based machines requires no special
   configuration.  The provided /etc/X11/xorg.conf will work in most
   setups.

   However, multi-headed configurations will require some changes to this
   file. Starting from the existing /etc/X11/xorg.conf, three additional
   sections are added for the second framebuffer:
d13 3
a15 3
		Identifier      "Wsdisplay1"
		Driver          "wsfb"
		Option          "device" "/dev/ttyD0"
d18 3
a20 8
	Section "Monitor"
		Identifier   "Monitor1"
		VendorName   "Unknown"
		ModelName    "Unknown"
	# Adjust those to your monitor before using another device than wsfb
	# or you can destroy it !!
		HorizSync    31.5-60
		VertRefresh  50-70
d23 6
a28 23
	Section "Screen"
		Identifier "Screen1"
		Device     "Wsdisplay1"
		Monitor    "Monitor1"
		SubSection "Display"
			Depth     1
		EndSubSection
		SubSection "Display"
			Depth     8
		EndSubSection
		SubSection "Display"
			Depth     16
		EndSubSection
		SubSection "Display"
			Depth     24
		EndSubSection
		SubSection "Display"
			Depth     32
		EndSubSection
	EndSection
   
   The ServerLayout section is also changed to include the second framebuffer
   and its logical location relative to the first, eg:
a33 2
		InputDevice	"zsmouse0" "CorePointer"
		InputDevice	"Keyboard0" "CoreKeyboard"
d41 2
a42 2
      in /etc/rc.conf(8) or /etc/rc.conf.local(8).  You do not need to disable
      the console getty.
