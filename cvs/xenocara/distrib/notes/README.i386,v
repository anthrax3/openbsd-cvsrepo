@Post-installation instructions for X.Org on OpenBSD/i386
--------------------------------------------------------

Conventions used in this document:
  - somename(1) implies that "somename" is a program, and there is a
    manual page available in section 1 of the manual pages for further
    reading, viewed by typing "man 1 somename".

1. Start either xenodm(1) or startx(1).

   a. Start xenodm(1), the X display manager by activating xenodm in 
      /etc/rc.conf.local(8):

      # rcctl enable xenodm

   b. Start startx(1) from a console shell.  It is the X script that starts
      the X server and a few X applications, including a window manager.

2. If needed, Create the configuration file for your server.

   For many users of X.Org's servers, an xorg.conf file is not needed,
   X, will automatically detect and use your hardware.

   For the few cases where your hardware is not properly autodetected
   or supported or not supported as you wish, you will have to create
   a configuration file.

   See Xorg(1) and xorg.conf(5) for details.

3.1. Note about Radeon cards.

   OpenBSD provides two versions of the X.Org driver for ATI Radeon cards.

   - radeon(4) is the (almost) current X.Org driver. It has more support for
     recent hardware, but unfortunately also exposes a few regressions,
     leading to screen corruption on some hardware, and is known not
     to work in ZapHod mode. It is selected by default.

   - radeonold(4) is an older version of the driver, which is known to
     work on most of the Radeon cards, except the newer ones. It is
     robust and also works in "ZapHod" mode (one X screen per physical
     screen). It needs to be enabled explicitly by creating a simple
     /etc/X11/xorg.conf file containing:

     Section "Device"
             Identifier "Old Radeon card"
             Driver "radeonold"
     EndSection

   What kind of mouse do you have and which port is it connected to?
   The two most common cases are a PS/2 style or USB mouse, for which
   OpenBSD uses the wsmouse(4) protocol with the /dev/wsmouse device.
   If you have a serial mouse, connected to /dev/tty00 (MS Windows

   you will need to reboot for the change to take effect. Most drivers for
   X.Org XOrgVersion servers require this value to be set to 2, while
   drivers for XFree86 3.3.6 require it only to be set to 1.

   You need to decide if you can use the X.Org XOrgVersion server,
   Xorg(1), or if you have some legacy VGA card supported only by
   one of the old XFree86 3.3.6 servers:

        XF86_3DLabs(1) XF86_Mach8(1)  XF86_S3(1)   XF86_VGA16(1)
        XF86_I128(1)   XF86_Mach32(1) XF86_S3V(1)  XF86_SVGA(1)
        XF86_8514(1)   XF86_Mach64(1) XF86_W32(1)  XF86_Mono(1)
        XF86_P9000(1)  XF86_AGX(1)

   If in doubt, try X.Org XOrgVersion first.

d40 2
a41 36
   XFree86 3.3.6 will require an /etc/XF86Config file to be generated.

   Please note the location of the configuration file listed below.
   Both the location and the utilities that generate them are different.
   You will not have great success mixing X.Org XOrgVersion xorg.conf(5)
   files with XFree86 3.3.6 XF86Config files.

    a. For the X.Org XOrgVersion server, run xorgcfg(1) or xorgconfig(1).
       - The text mode of xorgcfg(1) is recommended, by typing
         "xorgcfg -textmode".
       - This will produce the /etc/X11/xorg.conf file.
       - This will create /usr/X11R6/bin/X as a link to Xorg.
       - If "xorgcfg -textmode" doesn't work on your hardware, try
         the alternate program, xorgconfig(1).
       - if neither of these alternatives produce a good file, try
         "X -configure" as root.  This will produce a "best guess"
         xorg.conf.new file, which can be used as a starting point
         for your modifications.

       See the X.Org XOrgVersion documentation available at:

              /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/doc/

       See also Xorg(1), xorg.conf(5).

    b. For the XFree86 3.3.6 server, run XF86Setup(1) or xf86config3(1).

       - This will make the /etc/XF86Config file.
       - This will create /usr/X11R6/bin/X as a link to your XF86_* server,
         one of the XFree86 3.3.6 servers listed in item 2 above.
       - If for some reason XF86Setup(1) doesn't work on your hardware, try
         the alternate program xf86config3(1).

       See the XF86Config user's guide for XFree86 3.3.6 servers at:

              /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/doc/XFree86-3.3.6/QuickStart.doc
