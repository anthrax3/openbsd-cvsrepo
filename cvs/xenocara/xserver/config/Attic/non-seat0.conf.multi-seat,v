@# This is the default configuration for servers on seat-1 and above.
#
# Start the server with -config non-seat0.conf.multi-seat, or alternatively
# rename the file to end in .conf and put it in the standard config
# directory (though it will apply to _all_ seats!).
#
# * Disable VT switching with Ctrl-Alt-F1
# * Force a grab on all input devices to detach them from the VT subsystem
#   to avoid event leakage.
