.SH NAME
exa \- new 2D acceleration architecture for X.Org
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B EXA
provides a simple API for video drivers to implement for 2D acceleration.  It
is a module loaded by drivers, and is not intended to be loaded on its own.
See your driver's manual page for how to enable 
.BR EXA .
.PP
The
.B EXA
architecture is designed to make accelerating the Render extension simple and
efficient, and results in various performance tradeoffs compared to XAA.  Some
__xconfigfile__ options are available for debugging performance issues or
driver rendering problems.  They are not intended for general use.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qEXANoComposite\*q \*q" boolean \*q
Disables acceleration of the Composite operation, which is at the heart of
the Render extension.  Not related to the Composite extension.  Default: No.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qEXANoUploadToScreen\*q \*q" boolean \*q
Disables acceleration of uploading pixmap data to the framebuffer. Default: No.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qEXANoDownloadFromScreen\*q \*q" boolean \*q
Disables acceleration of downloading of pixmap data from the framebuffer. 
.B NOTE:
Not usable with drivers which rely on DownloadFromScreen succeeding.
Default: No.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qMigrationHeuristic\*q \*q" anystr \*q
Chooses an alternate pixmap migration heuristic, for debugging purposes.  The
default is intended to be the best performing one for general use, though others
may help with specific use cases.  Available options include \*qalways\*q,
\*qgreedy\*q, and \*qsmart\*q.  Default: always.

.BI "Option \*qEXAOptimizeMigration\*q \*q" boolean \*q
Enables an additional optimization for migration of destination pixmaps. This
may improve performance in some cases (e.g. when switching virtual desktops with
no compositing manager) but causes corruption in others (e.g. when starting
compiz). Default: No.
