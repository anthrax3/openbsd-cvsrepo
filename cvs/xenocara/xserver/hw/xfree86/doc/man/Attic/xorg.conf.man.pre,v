.SH NAME
__xconfigfile__ and __xconfigdir__ \- configuration files for
__xservername__ X server
.SH INTRODUCTION
.B __xservername__
supports several mechanisms for supplying/obtaining configuration and
run-time parameters: command line options, environment variables, the
__xconfigfile__ and __xconfigdir__ configuration files, auto-detection,
and fallback defaults. When the same information is supplied in more
than one way, the highest precedence mechanism is used. The list of
mechanisms is ordered from highest precedence to lowest. Note that not
all parameters can be supplied via all methods. The available command
line options and environment variables (and some defaults) are
described in the Xserver(__appmansuffix__) and
__xservername__(__appmansuffix__) manual pages. Most configuration file
parameters, with their defaults, are described below. Driver and module
specific configuration parameters are described in the relevant driver
or module manual page.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B __xservername__
uses a configuration file called
.I __xconfigfile__
and files ending in the suffix
.I .conf
from the directory
.I __xconfigdir__
for its initial setup.
The
.I __xconfigfile__
configuration file is searched for in the following places when the
server is started as a normal user:
.PP
.RS 4
.nf
.IR /etc/X11/ <cmdline>
.IR __projectroot__/etc/X11/ <cmdline>
.IB /etc/X11/ $XORGCONFIG
.IB __projectroot__/etc/X11/ $XORGCONFIG
.I /etc/X11/__xconfigfile__\-4
.I /etc/X11/__xconfigfile__
.I /etc/__xconfigfile__
.IR __projectroot__/etc/X11/__xconfigfile__. <hostname>
.I __projectroot__/etc/X11/__xconfigfile__\-4
.I __projectroot__/etc/X11/__xconfigfile__
.IR __projectroot__/lib/X11/__xconfigfile__. <hostname>
.I __projectroot__/lib/X11/__xconfigfile__\-4
.I __projectroot__/lib/X11/__xconfigfile__
.fi
.RE
.PP
where
.I <cmdline>
is a relative path (with no \(lq..\(rq components) specified with the
.B \-config
command line option,
.B $XORGCONFIG
is the relative path (with no \(lq..\(rq components) specified by that
environment variable, and
.I <hostname>
is the machine's hostname as reported by
.BR gethostname (__libmansuffix__).
.PP
When the __xservername__ server is started by the \(lqroot\(rq user, the config file
search locations are as follows:
.PP
.RS 4
.nf
<cmdline>
.IR /etc/X11/ <cmdline>
.IR __projectroot__/etc/X11/ <cmdline>
.B $XORGCONFIG
.IB /etc/X11/ $XORGCONFIG
.IB __projectroot__/etc/X11/ $XORGCONFIG
.I /etc/X11/__xconfigfile__\-4
.I /etc/X11/__xconfigfile__
.I /etc/__xconfigfile__
.IR __projectroot__/etc/X11/__xconfigfile__. <hostname>
.I __projectroot__/etc/X11/__xconfigfile__\-4
.I __projectroot__/etc/X11/__xconfigfile__
.IR __projectroot__/lib/X11/__xconfigfile__. <hostname>
.I __projectroot__/lib/X11/__xconfigfile__\-4
.I __projectroot__/lib/X11/__xconfigfile__
.fi
.RE
.PP
where
.I <cmdline>
is the path specified with the
.B \-config
command line option (which may be absolute or relative),
.B $XORGCONFIG
is the path specified by that
environment variable (absolute or relative),
.B $HOME
is the path specified by that environment variable (usually the home
directory), and
.I <hostname>
is the machine's hostname as reported by
.BR gethostname (__libmansuffix__).
.PP
Additional configuration files are searched for in the following
directories when the server is started as a normal user:
.PP
.RS 4
.nf
.IR /etc/X11/ <cmdline>
.IR __sysconfdir__/X11/ <cmdline>
.I /etc/X11/__xconfigdir__
.I __sysconfdir__/X11/__xconfigdir__
.fi
.RE
.PP
where
.I <cmdline>
is a relative path (with no \(lq..\(rq components) specified with the
.B \-configdir
command line option.
.PP
When the __xservername__ server is started by the \(lqroot\(rq user, the
config directory search locations are as follows:
.PP
.RS 4
.nf
<cmdline>
.IR /etc/X11/ <cmdline>
.IR __sysconfdir__/X11/ <cmdline>
.I /etc/X11/__xconfigdir__
.I __sysconfdir__/X11/__xconfigdir__
.fi
.RE
.PP
where
.I <cmdline>
is the path specified with the
.B \-configdir
command line option (which may be absolute or relative).
.PP
Finally, configuration files will also be searched for in directories
reserved for system use. These are to separate configuration files from
the vendor or 3rd party packages from those of local administration.
These files are found in the following directories:
.PP
.RS 4
.nf
.I /usr/share/X11/__xconfigdir__
.I __datadir__/X11/__xconfigdir__
.fi
.RE
.PP
The
.I __xconfigfile__
and
.I __xconfigdir__
files are composed of a number of sections which may be present in any order,
or omitted to use default configuration values.
Each section has the form:
.PP
.RS 4
.nf
.BI "Section  \*q" SectionName \*q
.RI "    " SectionEntry
    ...
.B EndSection
.fi
.RE
.PP
The section names are:
.PP
.RS 4
.nf
.BR "Files          " "File pathnames"
.BR "ServerFlags    " "Server flags"
.BR "Module         " "Dynamic module loading"
.BR "Extensions     " "Extension enabling"
.BR "InputDevice    " "Input device description"
.BR "InputClass     " "Input class description"
.BR "Device         " "Graphics device description"
.BR "VideoAdaptor   " "Xv video adaptor description"
.BR "Monitor        " "Monitor description"
.BR "Modes          " "Video modes descriptions"
.BR "Screen         " "Screen configuration"
.BR "ServerLayout   " "Overall layout"
.BR "DRI            " "DRI\-specific configuration"
.BR "Vendor         " "Vendor\-specific configuration"
.fi
.RE
.PP
The following obsolete section names are still recognised for compatibility
purposes.
In new config files, the
.B InputDevice
section should be used instead.
.PP
.RS 4
.nf
.BR "Keyboard       " "Keyboard configuration"
.BR "Pointer        " "Pointer/mouse configuration"
.fi
.RE
.PP
The old
.B XInput
section is no longer recognised.
.PP
The
.B ServerLayout
sections are at the highest level.
They bind together the input and output devices that will be used in a session.
The input devices are described in the
.B InputDevice
sections.
Output devices usually consist of multiple independent components (e.g.,
a graphics board and a monitor).
These multiple components are bound together in the
.B Screen
sections, and it is these that are referenced by the
.B ServerLayout
section.
Each
.B Screen
section binds together a graphics board and a monitor.
The graphics boards are described in the
.B Device
sections, and the monitors are described in the
.B Monitor
sections.
.PP
Config file keywords are case\-insensitive, and \(lq_\(rq characters are
ignored.
Most strings (including
.B Option
names) are also case-insensitive, and insensitive to white space and
\(lq_\(rq characters.
.PP
Each config file entry usually takes up a single line in the file.  They
consist of a keyword, which is possibly followed by one or more arguments,
with the number and types of the arguments depending on the keyword.
The argument types are:
.PP
.RS 4
.nf
.BR "Integer     " "an integer number in decimal, hex or octal"
.BR "Real        " "a floating point number"
.BR "String      " "a string enclosed in double quote marks (\*q)"
.fi
.RE
.PP
Note: hex integer values must be prefixed with \(lq0x\(rq, and octal values
with \(lq0\(rq.
.PP
A special keyword called
.B Option
may be used to provide free\-form data to various components of the server.
The
.B Option
keyword takes either one or two string arguments.
The first is the option name, and the optional second argument is the
option value.
Some commonly used option value types include:
.PP
.RS 4
.nf
.BR "Integer     " "an integer number in decimal, hex or octal"
.BR "Real        " "a floating point number"
.BR "String      " "a sequence of characters"
.BR "Boolean     " "a boolean value (see below)"
.BR "Frequency   " "a frequency value (see below)"
.fi
.RE
.PP
Note that
.I all
.B Option
values, not just strings, must be enclosed in quotes.
.PP
Boolean options may optionally have a value specified.
When no value is specified, the option's value is
.BR TRUE .
The following boolean option values are recognised as
.BR TRUE :
.PP
.RS 4
.BR 1 ,
.BR on ,
.BR true ,
.B yes
.RE
.PP
and the following boolean option values are recognised as
.BR FALSE :
.PP
.RS 4
.BR 0 ,
.BR off ,
.BR false ,
.B no
.RE
.PP
If an option name is prefixed with
.RB \*q No \*q,
then the option value is negated.
.PP
Example: the following option entries are equivalent:
.PP
.RS 4
.nf
.B "Option \*qAccel\*q   \*qOff\*q"
.B "Option \*qNoAccel\*q"
.B "Option \*qNoAccel\*q \*qOn\*q"
.B "Option \*qAccel\*q   \*qfalse\*q"
.B "Option \*qAccel\*q   \*qno\*q"
.fi
.RE
.PP
Frequency option values consist of a real number that is optionally
followed by one of the following frequency units:
.PP
.RS 4
.BR Hz ,
.BR k ,
.BR kHz ,
.BR M ,
.B MHz
.RE
.PP
When the unit name is omitted, the correct units will be determined from
the value and the expectations of the appropriate range of the value.
It is recommended that the units always be specified when using frequency
option values to avoid any errors in determining the value.
.SH "FILES SECTION"
The
.B Files
section is used to specify some path names required by the server.
Some of these paths can also be set from the command line (see
.BR Xserver (__appmansuffix__)
and
.BR __xservername__ (__appmansuffix__)).
The command line settings override the values specified in the config
file.
The
.B Files
section is optional, as are all of the entries that may appear in it.
.PP
The entries that can appear in this section are:
.TP 7
.BI "FontPath \*q" path \*q
sets the search path for fonts.
This path is a comma separated list of font path elements which the __xservername__
server searches for font databases.
Multiple
.B FontPath
entries may be specified, and they will be concatenated to build up the
fontpath used by the server.  Font path elements can be absolute
directory paths, catalogue directories or a font server identifier. The
formats of the later two are explained below:
.PP
.RS 7
Catalogue directories:
.PP
.RS 4
Catalogue directories can be specified using the prefix \fBcatalogue:\fR
before the directory name. The directory can then be populated with
symlinks pointing to the real font directories, using the following
syntax in the symlink name:
.PP
.RS 4
.IR <identifier> : [attribute]: pri= <priority>
.RE
.PP
where
.I <identifier>
is an alphanumeric identifier,
.I [attribute]
is an attribute which will be passed to the underlying FPE and
.I <priority>
is a number used to order the fontfile FPEs. Examples:
.PP
.RS 4
.nf
.I 75dpi:unscaled:pri=20  -> /usr/share/X11/fonts/75dpi
.I gscript:pri=60 -> /usr/share/fonts/default/ghostscript
.I misc:unscaled:pri=10 \-> /usr/share/X11/fonts/misc
.fi
.PP
.RE .RE .RE
.PP
.RS 7
Font server identifiers:
.PP
.RS 4
Font server identifiers have the form:
.RS 4
.PP
.IR <trans> / <hostname> : <port\-number>
.RE
.PP
where
.I <trans>
is the transport type to use to connect to the font server (e.g.,
.B unix
for UNIX\-domain sockets or
.B tcp
for a TCP/IP connection),
.I <hostname>
is the hostname of the machine running the font server, and
.I <port\-number>
is the port number that the font server is listening on (usually 7100).
.RE
.PP
When this entry is not specified in the config file, the server falls back
to the compiled\-in default font path, which contains the following
font path elements (which can be set inside a catalogue directory):
.PP
.RS 4
.nf
.I __datadir__/fonts/X11/misc/
.I __datadir__/fonts/X11/TTF/
.I __datadir__/fonts/X11/OTF/
.I __datadir__/fonts/X11/Type1/
.I __datadir__/fonts/X11/100dpi/
.I __datadir__/fonts/X11/75dpi/
.fi
.RE
.PP
Font path elements that are found to be invalid are removed from the
font path when the server starts up.
.RE
.TP 7
.BI "ModulePath \*q" path \*q
sets the search path for loadable __xservername__ server modules.
This path is a comma separated list of directories which the __xservername__ server
searches for loadable modules loading in the order specified.
Multiple
.B ModulePath
entries may be specified, and they will be concatenated to build the
module search path used by the server.  The default module path is
.PP
.RS 11
__modulepath__
.RE
.\" The LogFile keyword is not currently implemented
.ig
.TP 7
.BI "LogFile \*q" path \*q
sets the name of the __xservername__ server log file.
The default log file name is
.PP
.RS 11
.RI __logdir__/__xservername__. <n> .log
.RE
.PP
.RS 7
where
.I <n>
is the display number for the __xservername__ server.
..
.TP 7
.BI "XkbDir \*q" path \*q
sets the base directory for keyboard layout files.  The
.B \-xkbdir
command line option can be used to override this.  The default directory is
.PP
.RS 11
__xkbdir__
.RE
.SH "SERVERFLAGS SECTION"
In addition to options specific to this section (described below), the
.B ServerFlags
section is used to specify some global
__xservername__ server options.
All of the entries in this section are
.BR Options ,
although for compatibility purposes some of the old style entries are
still recognised.
Those old style entries are not documented here, and using them is
discouraged.
The
.B ServerFlags
section is optional, as are the entries that may be specified in it.
.PP
.B Options
specified in this section (with the exception of the
.B \*qDefaultServerLayout\*q
.BR Option )
may be overridden by
.B Options
specified in the active
.B ServerLayout
section.
Options with command line equivalents are overridden when their command
line equivalent is used.
The options recognised by this section are:
.TP 7
.BI "Option \*qDefaultServerLayout\*q  \*q" layout\-id \*q
This specifies the default
.B ServerLayout
section to use in the absence of the
.B \-layout
command line option.
.TP 7
.BI "Option \*qNoTrapSignals\*q  \*q" boolean \*q
This prevents the __xservername__ server from trapping a range of unexpected fatal
signals and exiting cleanly.
Instead, the __xservername__ server will die and drop core where the fault occurred.
The default behaviour is for the __xservername__ server to exit cleanly, but still drop a
core file.
In general you never want to use this option unless you are debugging an __xservername__
server problem and know how to deal with the consequences.
.TP 7
.BI "Option \*qUseSIGIO\*q  \*q" boolean \*q
This controls whether the __xservername__ server requests that events from
input devices be reported via a SIGIO signal handler (also known as SIGPOLL
on some platforms), or only reported via the standard select(3) loop.
The default behaviour is platform specific.   In general you do not want to
use this option unless you are debugging the __xservername__ server, or
working around a specific bug until it is fixed, and understand the
consequences.
.TP 7
.BI "Option \*qDontVTSwitch\*q  \*q" boolean \*q
This disallows the use of the
.BI Ctrl+Alt+F n
sequence (where
.RI F n
refers to one of the numbered function keys).
That sequence is normally used to switch to another \*qvirtual terminal\*q
on operating systems that have this feature.
When this option is enabled, that key sequence has no special meaning and
is passed to clients.
Default: off.
.TP 7
.BI "Option \*qDontZap\*q  \*q" boolean \*q
This disallows the use of the
.B Terminate_Server
XKB action (usually on Ctrl+Alt+Backspace, depending on XKB options).
This action is normally used to terminate the __xservername__ server.
When this option is enabled, the action has no effect.
Default: off.
.TP 7
.BI "Option \*qDontZoom\*q  \*q" boolean \*q
This disallows the use of the
.B Ctrl+Alt+Keypad\-Plus
and
.B Ctrl+Alt+Keypad\-Minus
sequences.
These sequences allows you to switch between video modes.
When this option is enabled, those key sequences have no special meaning
and are passed to clients.
Default: off.
.TP 7
.BI "Option \*qDisableVidModeExtension\*q  \*q" boolean \*q
This disables the parts of the VidMode extension used by the xvidtune client
that can be used to change the video modes.
Default: the VidMode extension is enabled.
.TP 7
.BI "Option \*qAllowNonLocalXvidtune\*q  \*q" boolean \*q
This allows the xvidtune client (and other clients that use the VidMode
extension) to connect from another host.
Default: off.
.TP 7
.BI "Option \*qAllowMouseOpenFail\*q  \*q" boolean \*q
This tells the mousedrv(__drivermansuffix__) and vmmouse(__drivermansuffix__)
drivers to not report failure if the mouse device can't be opened/initialised.
It has no effect on the evdev(__drivermansuffix__) or other drivers.
The previous functionality of allowing the server to start up even if
the mouse device can't be opened/initialised is now handled by the
AllowEmptyInput option.
Default: false.
.TP 7
.BI "Option \*qVTSysReq\*q  \*q" boolean \*q
enables the SYSV\-style VT switch sequence for non\-SYSV systems
which support VT switching.
This sequence is
.B Alt\-SysRq
followed by a function key
.RB ( Fn ).
This prevents the __xservername__ server trapping the
keys used for the default VT switch sequence, which means that clients can
access them.
Default: off.
.TP 7
.BI "Option \*qBlankTime\*q  \*q" time \*q
sets the inactivity timeout for the
.B blank
phase of the screensaver.
.I time
is in minutes.
This is equivalent to the __xservername__ server's
.B \-s
flag, and the value can be changed at run\-time with
.BR xset(__appmansuffix__).
Default: 10 minutes.
.TP 7
.BI "Option \*qStandbyTime\*q  \*q" time \*q
sets the inactivity timeout for the
.B standby
phase of DPMS mode.
.I time
is in minutes, and the value can be changed at run\-time with
.BR xset(__appmansuffix__).
Default: 10 minutes.
This is only suitable for VESA DPMS compatible monitors, and may not be
supported by all video drivers.
It is only enabled for screens that have the
.B \*qDPMS\*q
option set (see the MONITOR section below).
.TP 7
.BI "Option \*qSuspendTime\*q  \*q" time \*q
sets the inactivity timeout for the
.B suspend
phase of DPMS mode.
.I time
is in minutes, and the value can be changed at run\-time with
.BR xset(__appmansuffix__).
Default: 10 minutes.
This is only suitable for VESA DPMS compatible monitors, and may not be
supported by all video drivers.
It is only enabled for screens that have the
.B \*qDPMS\*q
option set (see the MONITOR section below).
.TP 7
.BI "Option \*qOffTime\*q  \*q" time \*q
sets the inactivity timeout for the
.B off
phase of DPMS mode.
.I time
is in minutes, and the value can be changed at run\-time with
.BR xset(__appmansuffix__).
Default: 10 minutes.
This is only suitable for VESA DPMS compatible monitors, and may not be
supported by all video drivers.
It is only enabled for screens that have the
.B \*qDPMS\*q
option set (see the MONITOR section below).
.TP 7
.BI "Option \*qPixmap\*q  \*q" bpp \*q
This sets the pixmap format to use for depth 24.
Allowed values for
.I bpp
are 24 and 32.
Default: 32 unless driver constraints don't allow this (which is rare).
Note: some clients don't behave well when this value is set to 24.
.TP 7
.BI "Option \*qPC98\*q  \*q" boolean \*q
Specify that the machine is a Japanese PC\-98 machine.
This should not be enabled for anything other than the Japanese\-specific
PC\-98 architecture.
Default: auto\-detected.
.TP 7
.BI "Option \*qNoPM\*q  \*q" boolean \*q
Disables something to do with power management events.
Default: PM enabled on platforms that support it.
.TP 7
.BI "Option \*qXinerama\*q  \*q" boolean \*q
enable or disable XINERAMA extension.
Default is disabled.
.TP 7
.BI "Option \*qAIGLX\*q \*q" boolean \*q
enable or disable AIGLX. AIGLX is enabled by default.
.TP 7
.BI "Option \*qDRI2\*q \*q" boolean \*q
enable or disable DRI2. DRI2 is disabled by default.
.TP 7
.BI "Option \*qGlxVisuals\*q \*q" string \*q
This option controls how many GLX visuals the GLX modules sets up.
The default value is
.BR "typical" ,
which will setup up a typical subset of
the GLXFBConfigs provided by the driver as GLX visuals.  Other options are
.BR "minimal" ,
which will set up the minimal set allowed by the GLX specification and
.BR "all"
which will setup GLX visuals for all GLXFBConfigs.
.TP 7
.BI "Option \*qUseDefaultFontPath\*q \*q" boolean \*q
Include the default font path even if other paths are specified in
xorg.conf. If enabled, other font paths are included as well. Enabled by
default.
.TP 7
.BI "Option \*qIgnoreABI\*q \*q" boolean \*q
Allow modules built for a different, potentially incompatible version of
the X server to load. Disabled by default.
.TP 7
.BI "Option \*qAllowEmptyInput\*q \*q" boolean \*q
If enabled, don't add the standard keyboard and mouse drivers, if there are no
input devices in the config file.  Enabled by default if AutoAddDevices and
AutoEnableDevices is enabled, otherwise disabled.
If AllowEmptyInput is on, devices using the kbd, mouse or vmmouse driver are ignored.
.TP 7
.BI "Option \*qAutoAddDevices\*q \*q" boolean \*q
If this option is disabled, then no devices will be added from HAL events.
Enabled by default.
.TP 7
.BI "Option \*qAutoEnableDevices\*q \*q" boolean \*q
If this option is disabled, then the devices will be added (and the
DevicePresenceNotify event sent), but not enabled, thus leaving policy up
to the client.
Enabled by default.
.TP 7
.BI "Option \*qLog\*q \*q" string \*q
This option controls whether the log is flushed and/or synced to disk after
each message.
Possible values are
.B flush
or
.BR sync .
Unset by default.
.SH "MODULE SECTION"
The
.B Module
section is used to specify which __xservername__ server modules should be loaded.
This section is ignored when the __xservername__ server is built in static form.
The type of modules normally loaded in this section are __xservername__ server
extension modules.
Most other module types are loaded automatically when they are needed via
other mechanisms.
The
.B Module
section is optional, as are all of the entries that may be specified in
it.
.PP
Entries in this section may be in two forms.
The first and most commonly used form is an entry that uses the
.B Load
keyword, as described here:
.TP 7
.BI "Load  \*q" modulename \*q
This instructs the server to load the module called
.IR modulename .
The module name given should be the module's standard name, not the
module file name.
The standard name is case\-sensitive, and does not include the \(lqlib\(rq
prefix, or the \(lq.a\(rq, \(lq.o\(rq, or \(lq.so\(rq suffixes.
.PP
.RS 7
Example: the DRI extension module can be loaded with the following entry:
.PP
.RS 4
.B "Load \*qdri\*q"
.RE
.RE
.TP 7
.BI "Disable  \*q" modulename \*q
This instructs the server to not load the module called
.IR modulename .
Some modules are loaded by default in the server, and this overrides that
default. If a
.B Load
instruction is given for the same module, it overrides the
.B Disable
instruction and the module is loaded. The module name given should be the
module's standard name, not the module file name. As with the
.B Load
instruction, the standard name is case-sensitive, and does not include the
"lib" prefix, or the ".a", ".o", or ".so" suffixes.
.PP
The second form of entry is a
.BR SubSection,
with the subsection name being the module name, and the contents of the
.B SubSection
being
.B Options
that are passed to the module when it is loaded.
.PP
Example: the extmod module (which contains a miscellaneous group of
server extensions) can be loaded, with the XFree86\-DGA extension
disabled by using the following entry:
.PP
.RS 4
.nf
.B "SubSection \*qextmod\*q"
.B "   Option  \*qomit XFree86\-DGA\*q"
.B EndSubSection
.fi
.RE
.PP
Modules are searched for in each directory specified in the
.B ModulePath
search path, and in the drivers, extensions, input, internal, and
multimedia subdirectories of each of those directories.
In addition to this, operating system specific subdirectories of all
the above are searched first if they exist.
.PP
To see what extension modules are available, check the extensions
subdirectory under:
.PP
.RS 4
.nf
__modulepath__
.fi
.RE
.PP
The \(lqextmod\(rq, \(lqdbe\(rq, \(lqdri\(rq, \(lqdri2\(rq, \(lqglx\(rq,
and \(lqrecord\(rq extension modules are loaded automatically, if they
are present, unless disabled with \*qDisable\*q entries.
It is recommended
that at very least the \(lqextmod\(rq extension module be loaded.
If it isn't, some commonly used server extensions (like the SHAPE
extension) will not be available.
.SH "EXTENSIONS SECTION"
The
.B Extensions
section is used to specify which X11 protocol extensions should be enabled
or disabled.
The
.B Extensions
section is optional, as are all of the entries that may be specified in
it.
.PP
Entries in this section are listed as Option statements with the name of
the extension as the first argument, and a boolean value as the second.
The extension name is case\-sensitive, and matches the form shown in the output
of \*qXorg -extension ?\*q.
.PP
.RS 7
Example: the MIT-SHM extension can be disabled with the following entry:
.PP
.RS 4
.nf
.B "Section \*qExtensions\*q"
.B "    Option \*qMIT-SHM\*q \*qDisable\*q"
.B "EndSection"
.fi
.RE
.RE
.SH "INPUTDEVICE SECTION"
The config file may have multiple
.B InputDevice
sections.
Recent X servers employ input hotplugging to add input devices, with the HAL
backend being the default backend for X servers since 1.4. It is usually not
necessary to provide
.B InputDevice
sections in the xorg.conf if hotplugging is enabled.
.PP
If hotplugging is disabled, there will normally
be at least two: one for the core (primary) keyboard
and one for the core pointer.
If either of these two is missing, a default configuration for the missing
ones will be used. In the absence of an explicitly specified core input
device, the first
.B InputDevice
marked as
.B CorePointer
(or
.BR CoreKeyboard )
is used.
If there is no match there, the first
.B InputDevice
that uses the \(lqmouse\(rq (or \(lqkbd\(rq) driver is used.
The final fallback is to use built\-in default configurations.
Currently the default configuration may not work as expected on all platforms.
.PP
.B InputDevice
sections have the following format:
.PP
.RS 4
.nf
.B  "Section \*qInputDevice\*q"
.BI "    Identifier \*q" name \*q
.BI "    Driver     \*q" inputdriver \*q
.I  "    options"
.I  "    ..."
.B  "EndSection"
.fi
.RE
.PP
The
.B Identifier
and
.B Driver
entries are required in all
.B InputDevice
sections.
All other entries are optional.
.PP
The
.B Identifier
entry specifies the unique name for this input device.
The
.B Driver
entry specifies the name of the driver to use for this input device.
When using the loadable server, the input driver module
.RI \*q inputdriver \*q
will be loaded for each active
.B InputDevice
section.
An
.B InputDevice
section is considered active if it is referenced by an active
.B ServerLayout
section, if it is referenced by the
.B \-keyboard
or
.B \-pointer
command line options, or if it is selected implicitly as the core pointer
or keyboard device in the absence of such explicit references.
The most commonly used input drivers are
.BR evdev (__drivermansuffix__)
on Linux systems, and
.BR kbd (__drivermansuffix__)
and
.BR mousedrv (__drivermansuffix__)
on other platforms.
.PP
.PP
.B InputDevice
sections recognise some driver\-independent
.BR Options ,
which are described here.
See the individual input driver manual pages for a description of the
device\-specific options.
.TP 7
.BI "Option \*qAutoServerLayout\*q  \*q" boolean \*q
Always add the device to the ServerLayout section used by this instance of
the server. This affects implied layouts as well as explicit layouts
specified in the configuration and/or on the command line.
.TP 7
.BI "Option \*qCorePointer\*q"
Deprecated, use
.B SendCoreEvents
instead.
.TP 7
.BI "Option \*qCoreKeyboard\*q"
Deprecated, use
.B SendCoreEvents
instead.
.TP 7
.BI "Option \*qAlwaysCore\*q  \*q" boolean \*q
.B
Deprecated, use
.B SendCoreEvents
instead.
.TP 7
.BI "Option \*qSendCoreEvents\*q  \*q" boolean \*q
Both of these options are equivalent, and when enabled cause the
input device to report core events through the master device. They are
enabled by default.  Any device configured to send core events will be
attached to the virtual core pointer or keyboard and control the cursor by
default. Devices with
.B SendCoreEvents
disabled will be \*qfloating\*q and only accessible by clients employing the
X Input extension. This option controls the startup behavior only, a device
may be reattached or set floating at runtime.
.TP 7
.BI "Option \*qSendDragEvents\*q  \*q" boolean \*q
Send core events while dragging. Enabled by default.
.PP
For pointing devices, the following options control how the pointer
is accelerated or decelerated with respect to physical device motion. Most of
these can be adjusted at runtime, see the xinput(1) man page for details. Only
the most important acceleration options are discussed here.
.TP 7
.BI "Option \*qAccelerationProfile\*q  \*q" integer \*q
Select the profile. In layman's terms, the profile constitutes the "feeling" of
the acceleration. More formally, it defines how the transfer function (actual
acceleration as a function of current device velocity and acceleration controls)
is constructed. This is mainly a matter of personal preference.
.PP
.RS 6

.fi
.RE
.TP 7
.BI "Option \*qConstantDeceleration\*q  \*q" real \*q
Makes the pointer go
.B deceleration
times slower than normal. Most useful for high-resolution devices.
.TP 7
.BI "Option \*qAdaptiveDeceleration\*q  \*q" real \*q
Allows to actually decelerate the pointer when going slow. At most, it will be
.B adaptive deceleration
times slower. Enables precise pointer placement without sacrificing speed.
.TP 7
.BI "Option \*qAccelerationScheme\*q  \*q" string \*q
Selects the scheme, which is the underlying algorithm.
.PP
.RS 7
.nf
.B  "predictable   default algorithm (behaving more predictable)"

.RE
.TP 7
.BI "Option \*qAccelerationNumerator\*q  \*q" integer \*q
.TP 7
.BI "Option \*qAccelerationDenominator\*q  \*q" integer \*q
Set numerator and denominator of the acceleration factor. The acceleration
factor is a rational which, together with threshold, can be used to tweak
profiles to suit the users needs. The
.B simple
and
.B limited
profiles use it directly (i.e. they accelerate by the factor), for other
profiles it should hold that a higher acceleration factor leads to a faster
pointer. Typically, 1 is unaccelerated and values up to 5 are sensible.
.TP 7
.BI "Option \*qAccelerationThreshold\*q  \*q" integer \*q
Set the threshold, which is roughly the velocity (usually device units per 10
ms) required for acceleration to become effective. The precise effect varies
with the profile however.

.SH "INPUTCLASS SECTION"
The config file may have multiple
.B InputClass
sections.
These sections are optional and are used to provide configuration for a
class of input devices as they are automatically added. An input device can
match more than one
.B InputClass
section. Each class can override settings from a previous class, so it is
best to arrange the sections with the most generic matches first.
.PP
.B InputClass
sections have the following format:
.PP
.RS 4
.nf
.B  "Section \*qInputClass\*q"
.BI "    Identifier  \*q" name \*q
.I  "    entries"
.I  "    ..."
.I  "    options"
.I  "    ..."
.B  "EndSection"
.fi
.RE
.PP
The
.B Identifier
entry is required in all
.B InputClass
sections.
All other entries are optional.
.PP
The
.B Identifier
entry specifies the unique name for this input class.
The
.B Driver
entry specifies the name of the driver to use for this input device.
After all classes have been examined, the
.RI \*q inputdriver \*q
module from the first
.B Driver
entry will be enabled when using the loadable server.
.PP
When an input device is automatically added, its characteristics are
checked against all
.B InputClass
sections. Each section can contain optional entries to narrow the match
of the class. If none of the optional entries appear, the
.B InputClass
section is generic and will match any input device. If more than one of
these entries appear, they all must match for the configuration to apply.
.PP
There are two types of match entries used in
.B InputClass
sections. The first allows various tokens to be matched against attributes
of the device. An entry can be constructed to match attributes from different
devices by separating arguments with a '|' character. Multiple entries of the
same type may be supplied to add multiple matching conditions on the same
attribute. For example:
.PP
.RS 4
.nf
.B  "Section \*qInputClass\*q"
.B  "    Identifier   \*qMy Class\*q"
.B  "    # product string must contain example and

.I  "    ..."
.B  "EndSection"
.fi
.RE
.TP 7
.BI "MatchProduct  \*q" matchproduct \*q
This entry can be used to check if the substring
.RI \*q matchproduct \*q
occurs in the device's product name.
.TP 7
.BI "MatchVendor  \*q" matchvendor \*q
This entry can be used to check if the substring
.RI \*q matchvendor \*q
occurs in the device's vendor name.
.TP 7
.BI "MatchDevicePath \*q" matchdevice \*q
This entry can be used to check if the device file matches the
.RI \*q matchdevice \*q
pathname pattern.
.TP 7
.BI "MatchOS \*q" matchos \*q
This entry can be used to check if the operating system matches the
case-insensitive
.RI \*q matchos \*q
string. This entry is only supported on platforms providing the
.BR uname (2)
system call.
.TP 7
.BI "MatchPnPID \*q" matchpnp \*q
The device's Plug and Play (PnP) ID can be checked against the
.RI \*q matchpnp \*q
shell wildcard pattern.
.TP 7
.BI "MatchUSBID \*q" matchusb \*q
The device's USB ID can be checked against the
.RI \*q matchusb \*q
shell wildcard pattern. The ID is constructed as lowercase hexadecimal numbers
separated by a ':'. This is the same format as the
.BR lsusb (8)
program.
.TP 7
.BI "MatchDriver \*q" matchdriver \*q
Check the case-sensitive string
.RI \*q matchdriver \*q
against the currently configured driver of the device. Ordering of sections
using this entry is important since it will not match unless the driver has
been set by the config backend or a previous
.B InputClass
section.
.TP 7
.BI "MatchTag \*q" matchtag \*q
This entry can be used to check if tags assigned by the config backend
matches the
.RI \*q matchtag \*q
pattern. A match is found if at least one of the tags given in
.RI \*q matchtag \*q
matches at least one of the tags assigned by the backend.
.PP
The second type of entry is used to match device types. These entries take a
boolean argument similar to
.B Option
entries.

When an input device has been matched to the
.B InputClass
section, any
.B Option

.B Option
is recognized. See the
.B InputDevice
section above for a description of the remaining
.B Option
entries.
.TP 7
.BI "Option \*qIgnore\*q \*q" boolean \*q

When using the loadable server, the driver module
.RI \*q driver \*q
will be loaded for each active
.B Device

.PP
.B Device
sections recognise some driver\-independent entries and
.BR Options ,
which are described here.
Not all drivers make use of these
driver\-independent entries, and many of those that do don't require them
to be specified because the information is auto\-detected.
See the individual graphics driver manual pages for further information
about this, and for a description of the device\-specific options.
Note that most of the
.B Options
listed here (but not the other entries) may be specified in the
.B Screen
section instead of here in the
.B Device

.TP 7
.BI "BusID  \*q" bus\-id \*q
This specifies the bus location of the graphics card.
For PCI/AGP cards,
the
.I bus\-id
string has the form
.BI PCI: bus : device : function
(e.g., \(lqPCI:1:0:0\(rq might be appropriate for an AGP card).
This field is usually optional in single-head configurations when using
the primary graphics card.
In multi-head configurations, or when using a secondary graphics card in a
single-head configuration, this entry is mandatory.
Its main purpose is to make an unambiguous connection between the device
section and the hardware it is representing.
This information can usually be found by running the pciaccess tool
scanpci.
.TP 7
.BI "Screen  " number
This option is mandatory for cards where a single PCI entity can drive more
than one display (i.e., multiple CRTCs sharing a single graphics accelerator
and video memory).
One
.B Device
section is required for each head, and this
parameter determines which head each of the
.B Device
sections applies to.
The legal values of
.I number
range from 0 to one less than the total number of heads per entity.
Most drivers require that the primary screen (0) be present.
.TP 7
.BI "Chipset  \*q" chipset \*q
This usually optional entry specifies the chipset used on the graphics
board.
In most cases this entry is not required because the drivers will probe the
hardware to determine the chipset type.
Don't specify it unless the driver-specific documentation recommends that you
do.
.TP 7
.BI "Ramdac  \*q" ramdac\-type \*q
This optional entry specifies the type of RAMDAC used on the graphics
board.
This is only used by a few of the drivers, and in most cases it is not
required because the drivers will probe the hardware to determine the
RAMDAC type where possible.
Don't specify it unless the driver-specific documentation recommends that you
do.
.TP 7
.BI "DacSpeed  " speed
.TP 7
.BI "DacSpeed  " "speed\-8 speed\-16 speed\-24 speed\-32"
This optional entry specifies the RAMDAC speed rating (which is usually
printed on the RAMDAC chip).
The speed is in MHz.
When one value is given, it applies to all framebuffer pixel sizes.
When multiple values are given, they apply to the framebuffer pixel sizes
8, 16, 24 and 32 respectively.
This is not used by many drivers, and only needs to be specified when the
speed rating of the RAMDAC is different from the defaults built in to
driver, or when the driver can't auto-detect the correct defaults.
Don't specify it unless the driver-specific documentation recommends that you
do.
.TP 7
.BI "Clocks  " "clock ..."
specifies the pixel that are on your graphics board.
The clocks are in MHz, and may be specified as a floating point number.
The value is stored internally to the nearest kHz.
The ordering of the clocks is important.
It must match the order in which they are selected on the graphics board.
Multiple
.B Clocks
lines may be specified, and each is concatenated to form the list.
Most drivers do not use this entry, and it is only required for some older
boards with non-programmable clocks.
Don't specify this entry unless the driver-specific documentation explicitly
recommends that you do.
.TP
.BI "ClockChip  \*q" clockchip\-type \*q
This optional entry is used to specify the clock chip type on graphics
boards which have a programmable clock generator.
Only a few __xservername__ drivers support programmable clock chips.
For details, see the appropriate driver manual page.
.TP 7
.BI "VideoRam  " "mem"
This optional entry specifies the amount of video ram that is installed
on the graphics board.
This is measured in kBytes.
In most cases this is not required because the __xservername__ server probes
the graphics board to determine this quantity.
The driver-specific documentation should indicate when it might be needed.
.TP 7
.BI "BiosBase  " "baseaddress"
This optional entry specifies the base address of the video BIOS for
the VGA board.
This address is normally auto-detected, and should only be specified if the
driver-specific documentation recommends it.
.TP 7
.BI "MemBase  " "baseaddress"
This optional entry specifies the memory base address of a graphics
board's linear frame buffer.
This entry is not used by many drivers, and it should only be specified if
the driver-specific documentation recommends it.

.BI "IOBase  " "baseaddress"
This optional entry specifies the IO base address.
This entry is not used by many drivers, and it should only be specified if
the driver-specific documentation recommends it.
.TP 7
.BI "ChipID  " "id"
This optional entry specifies a numerical ID representing the chip type.
For PCI cards, it is usually the device ID.
This can be used to override the auto-detection, but that should only be done
when the driver-specific documentation recommends it.

.PP
The only mandatory entry in a
.B Monitor
section is the
.B Identifier
entry.
.PP
The
.B Identifier
entry specifies the unique name for this monitor.
The
.B Monitor
section may be used to provide information about the specifications of the
monitor, monitor-specific
.BR Options ,
and information about the video modes to use with the monitor.
.PP
With RandR 1.2-enabled drivers, monitor sections may be tied to specific
outputs of the video card.  Using the name of the output defined by the video
driver plus the identifier of a monitor section, one associates a monitor
section with an output by adding an option to the Device section in the
following format:

.B Option \*qMonitor-outputname\*q \*qmonitorsection\*q

(for example,
.B Option \*qMonitor-VGA\*q \*qVGA monitor\*q
for a VGA output)
.PP
In the absence of specific association of monitor sections to outputs, if a
monitor section is present the server will associate it with an output to
preserve compatibility for previous single-head configurations.
.PP
Specifying video modes is optional because the server will use the DDC or other
information provided by the monitor to automatically configure the list of
modes available.
When modes are specified explicitly in the
.B Monitor
section (with the
.BR Modes ,
.BR ModeLine ,
or
.B UseModes
keywords), built-in modes with the same names are not included.
Built-in modes with different names are, however, still implicitly included,
when they meet the requirements of the monitor.

.B Monitor
sections are described below.
.TP 7
.BI "VendorName  \*q" vendor \*q

.TP 7
.BI "ModelName  \*q" model \*q
This optional entry specifies the monitor's model.
.TP 7
.BI "HorizSync  " "horizsync\-range"
gives the range(s) of horizontal sync frequencies supported by the
monitor.
.I horizsync\-range
may be a comma separated list of either discrete values or ranges of

A range of values is two values separated by a dash.
By default the values are in units of kHz.
They may be specified in MHz or Hz
if
.B MHz
or
.B Hz
is added to the end of the line.
The data given here is used by the __xservername__ server to determine if video
modes are within the specifications of the monitor.
This information should be available in the monitor's handbook.
If this entry is omitted, a default range of 28\-33kHz is used.
.TP 7
.BI "VertRefresh  " "vertrefresh\-range"
gives the range(s) of vertical refresh frequencies supported by the
monitor.
.I vertrefresh\-range
may be a comma separated list of either discrete values or ranges of

A range of values is two values separated by a dash.
By default the values are in units of Hz.

Most drivers support 8, 15, 16 and 24.
Some also support 1 and/or 4, and some may support other values (like 30).
Note:
.I depth
means the number of bits in a pixel that are actually used to determine
the pixel colour.
32 is not a valid
.I depth
value.
Most hardware that uses 32 bits per pixel only uses 24 of them to hold the
colour information, which means that the colour depth is 24, not 32.

entries are searched for using the method described above in the
.B INPUTDEVICE
section.  The
.I idev\-id
field is mandatory, and specifies the name of the
.B InputDevice
section being referenced.
Multiple
.I option
fields may be specified, each in double quotes.
The options permitted here are any that may also be given in the
.B InputDevice
sections.
Normally only session\-specific input device options would be used here.
The most commonly used options are:
.PP
.RS 11
.nf
.B \*qCorePointer\*q
.B \*qCoreKeyboard\*q
.B \*qSendCoreEvents\*q
.fi
.RE
.PP
.RS 7
and the first two should normally be used to indicate the core pointer
and core keyboard devices respectively.
.RE
.TP 7
.B Options
In addition to the following, any option permitted in the
.B ServerFlags
section may also be specified here.
When the same option appears in both places, the value given here overrides
the one given in the
.B ServerFlags
section.
.TP 7
.BI "Option \*qIsolateDevice\*q  \*q" bus\-id \*q
Restrict device resets to the specified
.IR bus\-id .
See the
.B BusID
option (described in
.BR "DEVICE SECTION" ,
above) for the format of the
.I bus\-id
parameter.
This option overrides
.BR SingleCard ,
if specified.
At present, only PCI devices can be isolated in this manner.
.TP 7
.BI "Option \*qSingleCard\*q  \*q" boolean \*q
As
.BR IsolateDevice ,

__xconfigfile__ configuration file, auto-detection, and fallback defaults.
When the same information is supplied in more than one way, the highest
precedence mechanism is used.  The list of mechanisms is ordered from
highest precedence to lowest.  Note that not all parameters can be
supplied via all methods.  The available command line options and
environment variables (and some defaults) are described in the Xserver(__appmansuffix__)
and __xservername__(__appmansuffix__) manual pages.  Most configuration file parameters, with
their defaults, are described below.  Driver and module specific
configuration parameters are described in the relevant driver or module
manual page.

a659 20
.BI "Option \*qHandleSpecialKeys\*q \*q" when \*q
This option controls when the server uses the builtin handler to process
special key combinations (such as
.BR Ctrl+Alt+Backspace ).
Normally the XKEYBOARD extension keymaps will provide mappings for each of
the special key combinations, so the builtin handler is not needed unless
the XKEYBOARD extension is disabled.
The value of
.I when
can be
.BR Always ,
.BR Never ,
or
.BR WhenNeeded .
Default: Use the builtin handler only if needed.
The server will scan the keymap for a mapping to the
.B Terminate
action and, if found, use XKEYBOARD for processing actions, otherwise
the builtin handler will be used.

a907 11
In the absence of an explicitly specified core input device, the first
.B InputDevice
marked as
.B CorePointer
(or
.BR CoreKeyboard )
is used.
If there is no match there, the first
.B InputDevice
that uses the \(lqmouse\(rq (or \(lqkbd\(rq) driver is used.
The final fallback is to use built\-in default configurations.
d916 5
d922 3
a924 12
When this is set, the input device is installed as the core (primary)
pointer device.
There must be exactly one core pointer.
If this option is not set here, or in the
.B ServerLayout
section, or from the
.B \-pointer
command line option, then the first input device that is capable of
being used as a core pointer will be selected as the core pointer.
This option is implicitly set when the obsolete
.B Pointer
section is used.
d927 3
a929 12
When this is set, the input device is to be installed as the core
(primary) keyboard device.
There must be exactly one core keyboard.
If this option is not set here, in the
.B ServerLayout
section, or from the
.B \-keyboard

purposes.  In new config files, the
d150 3
a152 3
sections are at the highest level.  They bind together the input and
output devices that will be used in a session.  The input devices
are described in the
d154 4
a157 3
sections.  Output devices usually consist of multiple independent
components (e.g., a graphics board and a monitor).  These multiple
components are bound together in the
d161 2
a162 1
section.  Each
d164 2
a165 2
section binds together a graphics board and a monitor.  The graphics
boards are described in the

Config file keywords are case-insensitive, and "_" characters are
ignored.  Most strings (including

Each config file entry usually takes up a single line in the file.
They consist of a keyword, which is possibly followed by one or
more arguments, with the number and types of the arguments depending
on the keyword.  The argument types are:
d191 2

Note: hex integer values must be prefixed with "0x", and octal values
with "0".

keyword takes either one or two string arguments.  The first is the option
name, and the optional second argument is the option value.  Some commonly
used option value types include:

They bind together the input and output devices that will be used in a session.  
The input devices are described in the
d151 3

sections.  
Output devices usually consist of multiple independent components (e.g.,
a graphics board and a monitor).  
These multiple components are bound together in the

section may be used to provide information about the specifications of the
monitor, monitor-specific
d1010 3
a1012 22
and information about the video modes to use with the monitor.
.PP
With RandR 1.2-enabled drivers, monitor sections may be tied to specific
outputs of the video card.  Using the name of the output defined by the video
driver plus the identifier of a monitor section, one associates a monitor
section with an output by adding an option to the Device section in the
following format:

.B Option \*qMonitor-outputname\*q \*qmonitorsection\*q

(for example, 
.B Option \*qMonitor-VGA\*q \*qVGA monitor\*q
for a VGA output)
.PP
In the absence of specific association of monitor sections to outputs, if a
monitor section is present the server will associate it with an output to
preserve compatibility for previous single-head configurations.
.PP
Specifying video modes is optional because the server will use the DDC or other
information provided by the monitor to automatically configure the list of
modes available.
When modes are specified explicitly in the
d1019 2
a1020 3
keywords), built-in modes with the same names are not included.
Built-in modes with different names are, however, still implicitly included,
when they meet the requirements of the monitor.
