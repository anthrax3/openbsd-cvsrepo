XCOMM To customise the XKB settings to suit your keyboard, modify the

XCOMM keyboard, you will probably want to use one of:
XCOMM
XCOMM    Option	"XkbModel"	"pc102"
XCOMM    Option	"XkbModel"	"pc105"
XCOMM
XCOMM If you have a Microsoft Natural keyboard, you can use:

XCOMM    Option	"XkbModel"	"microsoft"
XCOMM
XCOMM If you have a US "windows" keyboard you will want:
XCOMM
XCOMM    Option	"XkbModel"	"pc104"
XCOMM
XCOMM Then to change the language, change the Layout setting.
XCOMM For example, a german layout can be obtained with:
XCOMM
XCOMM    Option	"XkbLayout"	"de"
XCOMM
XCOMM or:
XCOMM
XCOMM    Option	"XkbLayout"	"de"
