/*
 *     scanfill.h
 *
 *     Written by Brian Kelleher; Jan 1985
 *
 *     This file contains a few macros to help track
 *     the edge of a filled object.  The object is assumed
 *     to be filled in scanline order, and thus the
 *     algorithm used is an extension of Bresenham's line
 *     drawing algorithm which assumes that y is always the
 *     major axis.
 *     Since these pieces of code are the same for any filled shape,
 *     it is more convenient to gather the library in one
 *     place, but since these pieces of code are also in
 *     the inner loops of output primitives, procedure call
 *     overhead is out of the question.
 *     See the author for a derivation if needed.

/*
 *  In scan converting polygons, we want to choose those pixels
 *  which are inside the polygon.  Thus, we add .5 to the starting
 *  x coordinate for both left and right edges.  Now we choose the
 *  first pixel which is inside the pgon for the left edge and the
 *  first pixel which is outside the pgon for the right edge.
 *  Draw the left pixel, but not the right.
 *
 *  How to add .5 to the starting x coordinate:
 *      If the edge is moving to the right, then subtract dy from the
 *  error term from the general form of the algorithm.
 *      If the edge is moving to the left, then add dy to the error term.
 *
 *  The reason for the difference between edges moving to the left
 *  and edges moving to the right is simple:  If an edge is moving
 *  to the right, then we want the algorithm to flip immediately.
 *  If it is moving to the left, then we don't want it to flip until
 *  we traverse an entire pixel.
