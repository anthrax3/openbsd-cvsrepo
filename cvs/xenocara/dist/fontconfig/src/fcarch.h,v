 * Each unique machine architecture needs an entry in this file
 * So far the differences boil down to: endianness, 32 vs 64 bit pointers,
 * and on 32bit ones, whether double is aligned to one word or two words.
 * Those result in the 6 formats listed below.
 *
 * If any of the assertion errors in fcarch.c fail, you need to add a new
 * architecture.  Contact the fontconfig mailing list in that case.
