@// Instructions
//
// 1. Set basic layout by:
//    setxkbmap -rules evdev -model jollasbj -layout cz
//
// 2. Set variant by:
//    setxkbmap -rules evdev -model jollasbj -layout cz -variant qwerty
//    In practice this is equivalent to:
//    setxkbmap -rules evdev -model jollasbj -layout cz_qwerty
//    However, the latter form isn't portable so always use the -variant option.
//
// 3. Set multilayout by:
//    setxkbmap -rules evdev -model jollasbj -layout "us,cz" -variant ",qwerty" -option grp:ctrl_shift_toggle
//    This sets the basic us layout active. You can switch to qwerty
//    variant of cz layout by pressing ctrl+shift.
//
// Pitfalls
//
// 1. Many to one mappings
//
// Higher level input method components don't necessarily handle many to
// one mappings correctly. They may assume that there exists only a one
// to one mapping between a hardware key and a symbol. Therefore you
// should take care not to introduce many to one mappings for keys that
// are going to be reverse mapped from a symbol to a hardware key.
//
// Currently at least the modifier keys are affected. Clients may set
// states, such as autorepeat, for hardware keys by reverse mapping a
// modifier symbol to a hardware key and then setting the state for the
// first hardware key that maps to the symbol. The correct way would be
// to modify the state of all hardware keys mapping to a given symbol.
//
// We are nice and keep the mappings one to one for clients that don't
// choose to handle many to one mappings.
