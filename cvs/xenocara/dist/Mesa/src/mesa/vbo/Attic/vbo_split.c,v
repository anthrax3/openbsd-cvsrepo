/* Deal with hardware and/or swtnl maximums:
 * - maximum number of vertices in buffer
 * - maximum number of elements (maybe zero)
 *
 * The maximums may vary with opengl state (eg if a larger hardware
 * vertex is required in this state, the maximum number of vertices
 * may be smaller than in another state).
 *
 * We want buffer splitting to be a convenience function for the code
 * actually drawing the primitives rather than a system-wide maximum,
 * otherwise it is hard to avoid pessimism.  
 *
 * For instance, if a driver has no hardware limits on vertex buffer
 * dimensions, it would not ordinarily want to split vbos.  But if
 * there is an unexpected fallback, eg memory manager fails to upload
 * textures, it will want to pass the drawing commands onto swtnl,
 * which does have limitations.  A convenience function allows swtnl
 * to split the drawing and vbos internally without imposing its
 * limitations on drivers which want to use it as a fallback path.
