@REMOVE THIS FILE BEFORE MERGING WITH TRUNK
------------------------------------------

OUTSTANDING BUGS

demos/reflect - reading back Z on Voodoo3, image offset to right
	Fixed in latest Glide.

Q3 - some polygons drawn as vertical strips, similar to bug that was
	seen in demos/fire.  Voodoo3 only.  May be related to glDepthMask
	or glColorMask.

book/fog - not fogging
	Fog in orthograph mode still not implemented.  Checking with
	3dfx engineers for ideas.

Q3 demo crashes after changing display settings
	but the full Q3 game version seems OK.



MORE OUTSTANDING BUGS

private context was NULL! causing immediate failure of any glx prog. cant
reproduce after restarting the X server. putting it down as halluc.

texture object image was NULL, causing segmentation failure. happens with
prboom. ive put a check in tdfx_texstate.c but this isn't a fix.

prboom, wall textures near first chainsaw aren't bound properly. sideways
movements causes the wall textures to move with you. prboom busted?

16bpp mode, quake3, windowed, q3dm1, floor under rocketlauncher bands. it
looks like multitexturing gone wrong. i'll disable a tmu and test.

sof, polygons appear at wrong x,y,z positions, intermittent, have not yet
found reliable way of reproducing. culling? sometimes polys disappear.

descent3 is all black in 16bpp mode - FIXED (palette problems)

smeared pixels in quake3 - FIXED (texture memory overlapped FB)



PERFORMANCE COMPARISON  (Brian / Alan)

  V3/16  is Voodoo3 in 16bpp on a P3/500
  V5/16  is Voodoo5 in 16bpp on a P3/600
  V5/32  is Voodoo5 in 32bpp on a P3/600
  V5A/16 is Voodoo5 in 16bpp on an Alpha AXP/600
  V5A/32 is Voodoo5 in 32bpp on an Alpha AXP/600
