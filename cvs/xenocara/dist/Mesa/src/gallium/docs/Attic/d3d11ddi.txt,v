@This document compares the D3D10/D3D11 device driver interface with Gallium.
It is written from the perspective of a developer implementing a D3D10/D3D11 driver as a Gallium state tracker.

Note that naming and other cosmetic differences are not noted, since they don't really matter and would severely clutter the document.
Gallium/OpenGL terminology is used in preference to D3D terminology.

NOTE: this document tries to be complete but most likely isn't fully complete and also not fully correct: please submit patches if you spot anything incorrect

Also note that this is specifically for the DirectX 10/11 Windows Vista/7 DDI interfaces.
DirectX 9 has both user-mode (for Vista) and kernel mode (pre-Vista) interfaces, but they are significantly different from Gallium due to the presence of a lot of fixed function functionality.

The user-visible DirectX 10/11 interfaces are distinct from the kernel DDI, but they match very closely.

* Accessing Microsoft documentation

See http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd445501.aspx ("D3D11DDI_DEVICEFUNCS") for D3D documentation.

Also see http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/d/f2d5ee2c-b7ba-4cd0-9686-b6508b5479a1/direct3d10_web.pdf ("The Direct3D 10 System" by David Blythe) for an introduction to Direct3D 10 and the rationale for its design.

The Windows Driver Kit contains the actual headers, as well as shader bytecode documentation.

To get the headers from Linux, run the following, in a dedicated directory:
wget http://download.microsoft.com/download/4/A/2/4A25C7D5-EFBE-4182-B6A9-AE6850409A78/GRMWDK_EN_7600_1.ISO
sudo mount -o loop GRMWDK_EN_7600_1.ISO /mnt/tmp
cabextract -x /mnt/tmp/wdk/headers_cab001.cab
rename 's/^_(.*)_[0-9]*$/$1/' *
sudo umount /mnt/tmp

d3d10umddi.h contains the DDI interface analyzed in this document: note that it is much easier to read this online on MSDN.
d3d{10,11}TokenizedProgramFormat.hpp contains the shader bytecode definitions: this is not available on MSDN.
d3d9types.h contains DX9 shader bytecode, and DX9 types
d3dumddi.h contains the DirectX 9 DDI interface

* Gallium functions with no direct D3D10/D3D11 equivalent

clear
	+ Gallium supports clearing both render targets and depth/stencil with a single call

fence_signalled
fence_finish
	+ D3D10/D3D11 don't appear to support explicit fencing; queries can often substitute though, and flushing is supported

set_clip_state
	+ Gallium supports fixed function user clip planes, D3D10/D3D11 only support using the vertex shader for them

set_polygon_stipple
	+ Gallium supports polygon stipple

clearRT/clearDS
	+ Gallium supports subrectangle fills of surfaces, D3D10 only supports full clears of views

* DirectX 10/11 DDI functions and Gallium equivalents

AbandonCommandList (D3D11 only)
	- Gallium does not support deferred contexts

CalcPrivateBlendStateSize
CalcPrivateDepthStencilStateSize
CalcPrivateDepthStencilViewSize
CalcPrivateElementLayoutSize
CalcPrivateGeometryShaderWithStreamOutput
CalcPrivateOpenedResourceSize
CalcPrivateQuerySize
CalcPrivateRasterizerStateSize
CalcPrivateRenderTargetViewSize
CalcPrivateResourceSize

CalcDeferredContextHandleSize (D3D11 only)
CalcPrivateCommandListSize (D3D11 only)
CalcPrivateDeferredContextSize (D3D11 only)
CalcPrivateTessellationShaderSize (D3D11 only)
CalcPrivateUnorderedAccessViewSize (D3D11 only)
	! D3D11 allocates private objects itself, using the size computed here
	* Gallium could do something similar to be able to put the private data inline into state tracker objects: this would allow them to fit in the same cacheline and improve performance

CheckDeferredContextHandleSizes (D3D11 only)
	- Gallium does not support deferred contexts

CheckFormatSupport -> screen->is_format_supported
	! Gallium passes usages to this function, D3D11 returns them
	- Gallium does not differentiate between blendable and non-blendable render targets
	! Gallium includes sample count directly, D3D11 uses additional query 

CheckMultisampleQualityLevels
	! is merged with is_format_supported

CommandListExecute (D3D11 only)
	- Gallium does not support command lists

CopyStructureCount (D3D11 only)
	- Gallium does not support unordered access views (views that can be written to arbitrarily from compute shaders)

ClearDepthStencilView -> clear_depth_stencil
ClearRenderTargetView -> clear_render_target
	# D3D11 is not totally clear about whether this applies to any view or only a "currently-bound view"
	+ Gallium allows to clear both depth/stencil and render target(s) in a single operation
	+ Gallium supports double-precision depth values (but not rgba values!)
	* May want to also support double-precision rgba or use "float" for "depth"

ClearUnorderedAccessViewFloat (D3D11 only)
ClearUnorderedAccessViewUint (D3D11 only)
	- Gallium does not support unordered access views (views that can be written to arbitrarily from compute shaders)

CreateBlendState (extended in D3D10.1) -> create_blend_state
	# D3D10 does not support per-RT blend modes (but per-RT blending), only D3D10.1 does
	+ Gallium supports logic ops
	+ Gallium supports dithering
	+ Gallium supports using the broadcast alpha component of the blend constant color

CreateCommandList (D3D11 only)
	- Gallium does not support command lists

CreateComputeShader (D3D11 only)
	- Gallium does not support compute shaders

CreateDeferredContext (D3D11 only)
	- Gallium does not support deferred contexts

CreateDomainShader (D3D11 only)
	- Gallium does not support domain shaders

CreateHullShader (D3D11 only)
	- Gallium does not support hull shaders

CreateUnorderedAccessView (D3D11 only)
	- Gallium does not support unordered access views

CreateDepthStencilState -> create_depth_stencil_alpha_state
	! D3D11 has both a global stencil enable, and front/back enables; Gallium has only front/back enables
	+ Gallium has per-face writemask/valuemasks, D3D11 uses the same value for back and front
	+ Gallium supports the alpha test, which D3D11 lacks

CreateDepthStencilView -> create_surface
CreateRenderTargetView -> create_surface
	! Gallium merges depthstencil and rendertarget views into pipe_surface
	- lack of render-to-buffer support
	+ Gallium supports using 3D texture zslices as a depth/stencil buffer (in theory)

CreateElementLayout -> create_vertex_elements_state
	! D3D11 allows sparse vertex elements (via InputRegister); in Gallium they must be specified sequentially
	! D3D11 has an extra flag (InputSlotClass) that is the same as instance_divisor == 0

CreateGeometryShader -> create_gs_state
CreateGeometryShaderWithStreamOutput -> create_gs_state + create_stream_output_state
CreatePixelShader -> create_fs_state
CreateVertexShader -> create_vs_state
	> bytecode is different (see D3d10tokenizedprogramformat.hpp)
	! D3D11 describes input/outputs separately from bytecode; Gallium has the tgsi_scan.c module to extract it from TGSI
	@@ TODO: look into DirectX 10/11 semantics specification and bytecode

CheckCounter
CheckCounterInfo
CreateQuery -> create_query

	+ Gallium supports D3D9 rasterization rules
	+ Gallium supports fixed line width
	+ Gallium supports fixed point size

CreateResource -> texture_create or buffer_create
	! D3D11 passes the dimensions of all mipmap levels to the create call, while Gallium has an implicit floor(x/2) rule
	# Note that hardware often has the implicit rule, so the D3D11 interface seems to make little sense
	# Also, the D3D11 API does not allow the user to specify mipmap sizes, so this really seems a dubious decision on Microsoft's part
	- D3D11 supports specifying initial data to write in the resource
	- Gallium does not support unordered access buffers
	! D3D11 specifies mapping flags (i.e. read/write/discard);:it's unclear what they are used for here

	! D3D11 sets primitive modes separately with IaSetTopology: it's not obvious which is better

DsSetShaderResources (D3D11 only)
DsSetShaderWithIfaces (D3D11 only)
	- Gallium does not support domain shaders

Flush -> flush
	! Gallium supports fencing, D3D11 just has a dumb glFlush-like function

GenMips
	- Gallium lacks a mipmap generation interface, and does this manually with the 3D engine
	* it may be useful to add a mipmap generation interface, since the hardware (especially older cards) may have a better way than using the 3D engine

GsSetConstantBuffers -> for(i = StartBuffer; i < NumBuffers; ++i) set_constant_buffer(PIPE_SHADER_GEOMETRY, i, phBuffers[i])

HsSetShaderWithIfaces (D3D11 only)
	- Gallium does not support hull shaders

IaSetIndexBuffer -> set_index_buffer
	+ Gallium supports 8-bit indices
	# the D3D11 interface allows index-size-unaligned byte offsets into the index buffer; most drivers will abort with an assertion

IaSetInputLayout -> bind_vertex_elements_state

IaSetTopology
	! Gallium passes the topology = primitive type to the draw calls
	* may want to add an interface for this
	- Gallium lacks support for DirectX 11 tessellated primitives
	+ Gallium supports line loops, triangle fans, quads, quad strips and polygons

IaSetVertexBuffers -> set_vertex_buffers
	- Gallium only allows setting all vertex buffers at once, while D3D11 supports setting a subset

OpenResource -> texture_from_handle

PsSetConstantBuffers -> for(i = StartBuffer; i < NumBuffers; ++i) set_constant_buffer(PIPE_SHADER_FRAGMENT, i, phBuffers[i])

RelocateDeviceFuncs
	- Gallium does not support moving pipe_context, while D3D11 seems to, using this

	# used to do vertex processing on the GPU on Intel G45 chipsets when it is faster this way (see www.intel.com/Assets/PDF/whitepaper/322931.pdf)
	# presumably this resets the primitive id system value
	- Gallium does not support vertex pipeline bypass anymore

ResourceCopyRegion
ResourceConvert (D3D10.1+ only)

SetDepthStencilState -> bind_depth_stencil_alpha_state and set_stencil_ref
	! D3D11 fuses bind_depth_stencil_alpha_state and set_stencil_ref in a single function

SetPredication -> render_condition
	# here both D3D11 and Gallium seem very limited (hardware is too, probably though)
	# ideally, we should support nested conditional rendering, as well as more complex tests (checking for an arbitrary range, after an AND with arbitrary mask )
	# of couse, hardware support is probably as limited as OpenGL/D3D11
	+ Gallium, like NV_conditional_render, supports by-region and wait flags
	- D3D11 supports predication conditional on being equal any value (along with occlusion predicates); Gallium only supports on non-zero

SetRenderTargets (extended in D3D11) -> set_framebuffer_state
	! Gallium passed a width/height here, D3D11 does not
