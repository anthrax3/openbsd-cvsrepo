@Random list of problems with i915g:

- What does this button do? Figure out LIS7 with regards to depth offset.

- Dies with BadDrawable on GLXFBconfig changes/destruction. Makes piglit totally
  unusable :( Upgrading xserver helped here, it doesn't crash anymore. Still
  broken, it doesn't update the viewport/get new buffers.

- Y-tiling is even more fun. i915c doesn't use it, maybe there's a reason?
  Texture sampling from Y-tiled buffers seems to work, though (save above
  problems).
  RESOLVED: Y-tiling works with the render engine, but not with the blitter.
  Use u_blitter and hw clears (PRIM3D_CLEAR_RECT).

- src/xvmc/i915_structs.h in xf86-video-intel has a few more bits of various
  commands defined. Scavenge them and see what's useful.

- Do smarter remapping. Right now we send everything onto tex coords 0-7.
  We could also use diffuse/specular and pack two sets of 2D coords in a single
  4D. Is it a big problem though? We're more limited by the # of texture
  indirections and the # of instructions.

- Finish front/back face. We need to add face support to lp_build_system_values_array and use it in draw_llvm.c.

- More optimizations, like replacing ADD + MUL with MAD or use DP2ADD.

- Replace constants and immediates which are 0,1,-1 or a combination of those with a swizzle.

- Schedule instructions to minimize the number of phases. One way is to replace
  R registers responsible for a boundary with U registers to avoid phase
  boundaries.

- Continue a previous primitive when there are no state changes

- Fix fragment discard

- Check if PIPE_CAP_BLEND_EQUATION_SEPARATE work, the code is there.
  If not fix it! A simple task, good for beginners.

- Add support for PIPE_CAP_POINT_SPRITE either via the draw module or directly
  via the hardware, look at the classic driver, more advanced.

- Kills the chip in 3D_PRIMITIVE LINELIST with mesa-demos/fbotexture in
  wireframe mode. Changing the cullmode to cw from none mitigates the crash. As
  does emitting only one line segment (2 indices) per 3D_PRIMITIVE command in
  the batch.

- Tends to hang the chip after a few minutes of openarena. Looks tiling related,
  at the last frame rendered has tiling corruption over the complete frame.

  wireframe mode.

- Tiling is funny: If unlucky, it renders/samples all black. No clue yet what's
  going on. Seems to depend on tiny details like whethever the sampler
  relocation is fenced/unfenced (broken _with_ fenced reloc using tiling bits!).

- Need to validate buffers before usage. Currently do_exec on the batchbuffer
  can fail with -ENOSPC.
