@Merge Mesa 10.2.9

@This is a mirror of the kernel validation code into the userspace GL library.
It is only built when USE_VC4_SIMULATOR is defined, for compiling the driver
on an x86 system with the simpenrose simulator.  It allows testing of changes
across the kernel and userspace with exposure to most of the software stack,
on a higher-performance and more-debuggable environment than the native
hardware.
