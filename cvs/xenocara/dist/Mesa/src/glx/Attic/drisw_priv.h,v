@Backport support for GLX_MESA_query_renderer for non Intel drivers.
This is desirable as the chromium port now uses this extension to
obtain pci vendor/device ids for use in feature/extension blacklists.

Prompted by a mail from byrnet@@, tested on r600g by krw@@

The newly added os_get_total_physical_memory() was passing the length of
a pointer rather than the type which made the sysctl call fail on
non 64 bit archs.  And it was passing the wrong pointer for the result.
Fixes for these problems have been submitted back upstream.
