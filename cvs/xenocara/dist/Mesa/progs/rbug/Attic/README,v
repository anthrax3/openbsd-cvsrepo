@                        REMOTE DEBUGGING CLI APPLICATIONS


= About =

This directory contains a Gallium3D remote debugging cli applications.


= Build Instructions =

To build, build a normal gallium build and from this directory do the following.

 make

= Usage =

Make sure that you driver has trace integration, see
src/gallium/driver/trace/README for more information about that. Then from on
the computer that you want to debug do:

 export GALLIUM_RBUG=true

 <launch app>

From the debugging computer launch apps form this directory. Currently ip
addresses are hardcoded and you need to edit the application, but that will
change in the future.

= Testing =

The two apps simple_client and simple_server. Are unit testing of the
connection and (de)marsheler. Just run the server first and then the client:

 ./simple_server &
 ./simple_client
