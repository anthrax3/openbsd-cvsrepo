			Mesa 6.5 Release Notes



Introduction
------------

Mesa uses an even/odd version number scheme like the Linux kernel.
Odd numbered versions (such as 6.5) designate new developmental releases.
Even numbered versions (such as 6.4) designate stable releases.



New Features
------------

OpenGL Shading language support
   This includes the GL_ARB_shader_objects, GL_ARB_shading_language_100,
   GL_ARB_vertex_shader and GL_ARB_fragment_shader extensions.  Most of
   the work was done by Michal Krol.
   There's probably a fair number of bugs since this is a pretty large,
   complicated body of code.

   The OpenGL 2.0 interface to these features will be implemented in a
   future version of Mesa,

GL_EXT_timer_query
   Used to measure the time of OpenGL operations at high precision.
   Only supported in the software/Xlib driver at this time.

GL_EXT_packed_depth_stencil
   Defines a new GL_DEPTH_STENCIL_EXT pixel format.

GL_EXT_framebuffer_blit
   A simplified glCopyPixels-like feature for copying pixel rectangles.

GL_ARB_half_float_pixel
   Adds a new half-precision floating point format for image transfers,
   such as for glDrawPixels, glReadPixels, glTexImage, etc.



Removed Extensions
------------------

The following extensions have been removed:

  GL_HP_occlusion_test - this is superceded by GL_ARB_occlusion_query.



Known Issues
------------

Rendering to depth textures will not work.  Rendering to GL_DEPTH_STENCIL
textures should work.



Driver Interface Changes
------------------------

Stencil: The Driver.StencilOp/Func/Mask() functions have been replaced by
the two-sided versions: Driver.Stencil*Separate().

Render-to-texture: The functions for rendering to textures have changed.



To Do (someday) items
---------------------
 Switch to freeglut
 Increase MAX_DRAWBUFFERS
 Fix linux-glide target/driver.
 Fix lambda calculation for frag progs.



Driver			Status
----------------------	----------------------
DRI drivers		varies with the driver
XMesa/GLX (on Xlib)	implements OpenGL 1.5
OSMesa (off-screen)	implements OpenGL 1.5
Glide (3dfx Voodoo1/2)	implements OpenGL 1.3
SVGA			implements OpenGL 1.3
Wind River UGL		implements OpenGL 1.3
Windows/Win32		implements OpenGL 1.5
DJGPP			implements OpenGL 1.5
GGI			implements OpenGL 1.3
BeOS			implements OpenGL 1.5
Allegro			needs updating
D3D			needs updating
