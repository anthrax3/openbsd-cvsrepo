<H1>Conformance</H1>

<p>
The SGI OpenGL conformance tests verify correct operation of OpenGL
implementations.  I, Brian Paul, have been given a copy of the tests
for testing Mesa.  The tests are not publically available.
</p>
<p>
This file has the latest results of testing Mesa with the OpenGL 1.2
conformance tests.  Testing with the preliminary OpenGL 1.3 tests has
also been done.  Mesa passes all the 1.3 tests.
</p>
<p>
The tests were run using the software X11 device driver on 24-bpp
and 16-bpp displays.
</p>
<p>
Mesa 4.0 and later pass all conformance tests at all path levels.
Note that this says nothing about the conformance of hardware drivers
based upon Mesa.
</p>
