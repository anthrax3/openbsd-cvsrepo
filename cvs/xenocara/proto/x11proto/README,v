@		X Window System Core Protocol

This package provides the headers and specification documents defining
the X Window System Core Protocol, Version 11.

It also includes a number of headers that aren't purely protocol related,
but are depended upon by many other X Window System packages to provide
common definitions and porting layer.

All questions regarding this software should be directed at the
Xorg mailing list:

        http://lists.freedesktop.org/mailman/listinfo/xorg

Please submit bug reports to the Xorg bugzilla:

        https://bugs.freedesktop.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=xorg
