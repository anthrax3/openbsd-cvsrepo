@Update to xf86-video-openchrome 0.2.906
@
text
@xf86-video-openchrome
---------------------
(http://www.openchrome.org)

SUPPORTED CHIPSETS :
--------------------
- CLE266 (VT3122)
- KM400/P4M800 (VT3205)
- K8M800 (VT3204)
- PM800/PM880/CN400 (VT3259)
- VM800/CN700/P4M800Pro (VT3314)
- CX700 (VT3324)
- P4M890 (VT3327)
- K8M890 (VT3336)
- P4M900/VN896 (VT3364)
- VX800 (VT3353)
- VX855 (VT3409)
- VX900 (VT3410)


SUPPORTED FEATURES :
--------------------
- Free modesetting for Unichrome, Unichrome Pro and Chrome9 chipsets.
- VBE modesetting for everything not natively supported.
- TV-out support.
- EXA acceleration.
- Hardware MPEG2 acceleration.


KNOWN BUGS/LIMITATIONS :
------------------------
* Laptop panel
- Laptop displays for anything other than CLE266 and KM400/P4M800 are only
  supported thru VBE calls.
- Virtual terminal is broken on some laptop displays. Use a vesa framebuffer to
  work around that (append vga=791 to your kernel command line, for example).

* XvMC
- The hardware MPEG4 acceleration that is present on some chipsets is not
  implemented.
- No XvMC support for CX700 and newer (new, unsupported engine).
- No XvMC support for K8M890, P4M890 and P4M900/VN896 (need to get dri working
  for them first).

* TV output
- TV modes are hardcoded and must be choosen inside a list depending on the TV
  encoder.
- Outputs are dependent on each other and will use the least common
  denominator. If you're using both VGA/LCD output and TV output, the VGA/LCD
  output will be limited by the TV encoder (720x576@@50Hz for example).
  In other words, there is no dual screen support.

* Misc.
- Add-on TMDS encoders are not supported, except thru VBE.
- CX700, VX800 and VX855 integrated TMDS is supported.

* Chrome9
- Chrome9 chipsets' family (P4M900, K8M890, VX800, VX855, VX900) currently
  doesn't support neither AGP DMA nor 3D acceleration. 


Please note that 3D acceleration is provided by Mesa (http://mesa3d.org) and is
not directly related to openchrome.

IMPORTANT NOTE :
----------------
- The driver name is now 'openchrome', and this is what you need to use in
  your xorg.conf now (instead of 'via'). The XvMC libraries have also been
  renamed, to 'libchromeXvMC.so' and 'libchromeXvMCPro.so'.
