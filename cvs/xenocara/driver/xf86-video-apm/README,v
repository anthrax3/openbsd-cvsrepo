  ______________________________________________________________________

  1.  Support chipsets

  The apm driver in the SVGA server is for Alliance Promotion graphics
  chipsets. The following chipsets are supported:


  o  6422

     Old chipset. The driver is still very unstable and has computer
     crashes. You should use XFree86 3.3.x for this chipset.


  o  AT24

     As found in Diamond Stealth Video 2500. Quite similar to AT3D.

  o  AT25, AT3D

     AT3D is found in Hercules Stingray 128/3D. Most other Voodoo Rush
     based cards use the AT25 which is identical except it doesn't have
     the 3D stuff in it.


  2.  Acceleration

  The apm driver uses the XAA in the SVGA server. It has support for the
  following acceleration:


  o  Bitblts (rectangle copy operation)

  o  Lines (solid, single pixel)

  o  Filled rectangles

  o  CPU->Screen image transfers.

  o  CPU->Screen colour expansion (text accel).

  o  Screen->Screen colour expansion (cached text accel).

  o  Mono 8x8 pattern fill. Not for 6422.

  o  Colour 8x8 pattern fill (in 8bpp). Not for 6422.

  o  Hardware cursor.

  o  Pixmap caching.

  All in 8, 16 and 32 bpp modes. In 24bpp mode only Bitblts and Filled
  rectangles is supported. Also VESA DPMS power save mode is fully
  supported with "standby", "suspend" and "off" modes (set with with the
  "xset dpms" command).


  3.  DGA

  Full DGA 2.0 support with framebuffer access and drawing acceleration.


  4.  Video

  It has limited hardware support for video decoding on the AT24 and
  AT25/3D. It can also display an image in YUV colours inside the
  desktop. There are some more exotic formats such as YUV 4.1.1, YUV
  4.0.0 and RGB 8,16.32bpp.


  5.  Shadow framebuffer

  There is a mode, called shadow framebuffer, where the graphics are
  used to display the images. All rendering is done in memory in a so-
  called shadow framebuffer. This mode is useful if you need lots of
  reading in the video memory and to use it you will have to put

    Option "ShadowFB"



  in your xorg.conf file.


  6.  Configuration

  You can turn off hardware cursor by inserting the following line in
  the Device section of the xorg.conf file:

    Option "SWcursor"



  Or turn off hardware acceleration:

    Option "noaccel"



  Or turn off MMIO


    Option "nolinear"



  Do not specify either the amount of video RAM or which chipset in the
  config file. It is better to let the driver probe for this. Also don't
  put any "clocks" line in the device section since these chips have a
  fully programmable clock that can almost take any modeline you throw
  at it. It might though fail at some specific clock values but in that
  case you should just try a slightly different clock and it should
  work.


  7.  glide2x

  There is support for the XF86Rush extension for use with the glide2x
  library.


  8.  Questions

  Any questions regarding this driver should be sent to Loic Grenie. It
  should be possible to add support for the 3210 chipset if someone
  needs it.

Note 1: This driver is work in progress. It might not work at all.
Want to help? Docs are at 
ftp://beta.xfree86.org/pub/xf86/devel/Documentation/apm

This is the Alliance Promotion driver for XFree86 4.0+. It currently only
supports the AT3D, AT25 chipsets (found on various Voodoo-Rush cards) and AT24.
There is incomplete support for the 6422. The 6422 chips are supported in the
XFree86 3.3.x series.

What has worked on my computer :
    - XAA for 8/16/24/32 bpp
    - DGA and DGA2
    - DPMS
    - glide2x
    - using as a module
    - shadow framebuffer
    - AT3D
    - AT24
    - AP6422 (although with problems, including locks)
    - multi card setup (with and without Xinerama)
    - Xv images, even with (slightly modified) glide2x ; note that there is
      still a little problem with vertical offset.

There is some support for PC-98 with the help of Isao Ohishi
(ohishi@@aero.rim.or.jp). It's still under development. I hope that 8bpp
works correctly.

What has not worked :
    - I2C (I'm not sure my card, Hercules 128/3D, has proper cabling)

What is untested :

What should be done :
    - overlays (with the video engine, everything should be overlayable
      with everything)
    - (why not) 3210 support

Kent Hamilton    Initial creation.
Henrik Harmsen   Lots of additions and fixes.  <hch@@cd.chalmers.se>
Loic Grenie      Conversion to 4.0.            <grenie@@lami.univ-evry.fr>
		 Additions and fixes.


History:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Created by Kent Hamilton for Xfree86 from source from Alliance

Modified 1997-06 by Henrik Harmsen
  - Added support for AT3D
  - Acceleration added for 8,16,32bpp: (for AT3D and AT24)
    - Filled rectangles
    - Screen-screen bitblts
    - Host-screen color expansion bitblts for text
  - DPMS support
  - Enabled hardware cursor code (also in 8bpp)
  - Set to programmable VCLK clock
  - Set MCLK to 57.3 MHz on AT3D.
  - Various bugfixes and cleanups

Modified 1997-07-06 by Henrik Harmsen
  - Fixed bug that made the HW cursor screw up on VT switches
  - Probably fixed bug that screwed up the screen when using
    screen-screen bitblts. This forced me to put an ApmSync() at 
    the end of ApmSubsequentScreenToScreenCopy() which makes
    me unhappy... But: Better it works than not...

Modified 1997-10-19 by Henrik Harmsen
  - HW line drawing.
  - HW clipping.
  - Added support for ROP's.
  - Text acceleration now lots faster and support for accelerated
    proportional text. (Uses SCANLINE_PAD_DWORD + clipping).
  - Combined write for many register writes gives good 
    general speedup. (write x+y as a single 32 bit entity, rather
    obvious, really...:-)
  - Now waits for correct number of free slots in FIFO before
    issuing writes to the card.
    This seems to have eliminated the last instances of dropped
    interrupts from serial IO and no more lost packets in PPP :-)
  - Converted cursor support to use XAA interface.
  - Fixed ApmSync(). Finally removed call to ApmSync at end of
    ApmSubsequentScreenToScreenCopy() :-)

Modified 1998-03-29 by Henrik Harmsen
  - Added DGA support.
  - Added accel support for AP6422. Fixed AT24 accel support.
  - Fixed clock register calculation for AP6422 and AT24.
  - DPMS support for AT24 & AP6422.
  - 2% faster text accel for AT24/AT3D :-)

Modified 1998-12-18 by Loic Grenie
  - Converted to Xfree86 4.0 driver interface. (Only support for 
    AT25/AT3D chips).

Modified 1999-03-14 by Henrik Harmsen
  - Various fixes to bring it up to 3.9Pd.
  - Added preliminary (completely untested) support for dynamic 
    loading.

Modified 1999-07-07 by Loïc Grenié
  - Converted to new RAC. Support for DGA and DGA2, I2C, Rush extension.

Modified 2000-02-10 by Loïc Grenié
  - Bug fixes
  - AP6422 (bugged !)
  - Xv driver
