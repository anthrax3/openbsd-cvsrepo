.SH DESCRIPTION
.B wildcatfb
is an __xservername__ driver for the Sun Expert3D framebuffer family,
relying upon the OpenBSD console mode framebuffer driver of the same name.
This driver is not accelerated yet, and only supports a 7-bit framebuffer
depth.
.br
All visual types are supported.
Multi-head configurations are supported.
.SH CONFIGURATION DETAILS
Please refer to __xconfigfile__(__filemansuffix__) for general configuration
details.
This section only covers configuration details specific to this driver.
.PP
For this driver it is not required to specify modes in the 
.B Screen
section of the configuration file.
The
.B wildcatfb
driver picks up the currently used video mode from the framebuffer
driver and uses it.
Video modes specifications in the configuration file are ignored.
