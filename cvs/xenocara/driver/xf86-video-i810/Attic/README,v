  [1m1.  Introduction[0m

  This document provides a brief summary of the i810/i815 support
  provided by the i810 driver.  Support for later chipsets is not
  covered here.  More up to date information about the i810 driver can
  be found in the i810(4) manual page.


  [1m2.  Supported Hardware[0m


  +o  Intel 810 motherboards:

     +o  i810,

     +o  i810-dc100,

     +o  i810e

     +o  i815



  [1m3.  Features[0m


  +o  Full support for 8, 15, 16, and 24 bit pixel depths.

  +o  Hardware cursor support to reduce sprite flicker.

  +o  Hardware accelerated 2D drawing engine support for 8, 15, 16 and 24
     bit pixel depths.

  +o  Support for high resolution video modes up to 1600x1200.

  +o  Fully programmable clock supported.

  +o  Robust text mode restore for VT switching.



  [1m4.  Technical Notes[0m


  +o  Hardware acceleration is not possible when using the framebuffer in
     32 bit per pixel format, and this mode is not supported by this
     driver.

  +o  Interlace modes cannot be supported.

  +o  This driver currently only works for Linux/ix86 and recent versions
     of FreeBSD.  It requires the agpgart kernel support, which is
     included in Linux kernels 2.3.42 and higher, and FreeBSD 4.1 and
     higher.



  [1m5.  Reported Working Video Cards[0m


  +o  Intel evaluation hardware - i810, i810-dc100, i810e and i815.

  +o  Tyan Tomcat Motherboard.

  +o  HappyPC set-top box.



  [1m6.  Configuration[0m

  The driver auto-detects all device information necessary to initialize
  the card.  The only lines you need in the "Device" section of your
  xorg.conf file are:

         Section "Device"
             Identifier "Intel i810"
             Driver     "i810"
         EndSection


  or let xorgconfig do this for you.

  However, if you have problems with auto-detection, you can specify:

  +o  DacSpeed - in MHz

  +o  MemBase  - physical address of the linear framebuffer

  +o  IOBase   - physical address of the memory mapped IO registers

  In order to use most resolutions, it is necessary to install the (see
  the notes in the module).

  Note: the i810 driver detects whether your motherboard has display
  cache video memory.  This memory is has reduced bandwidth compared to
  normal system memory, and isn't used by the server.  The main function
  of this memory is for ancillary buffers (eg. z buffer) in a
  forthcoming 3d capable server.



  [1m7.  Driver Options[0m


  +o  "NoAccel"  - Turn off hardware acceleration


  +o  "SWCursor" - Request a software cursor (hardware is default)

  +o  "Dac6Bit"  - Force the use of a 6 Bit Dac (8 Bit is the default)


  [1m8.  Known Limitations[0m


  +o  No 3D support in this release.

  +o  Running two X servers on different VTs is not supported at this
     time.

@Import the i810 driver version 1.4.1 plus OpenBSD patches,
that shipped with OpenBSD 3.9/4.0 and that actually works.
