.SH NAME
wsfb \- video driver for wsdisplay framebuffer device
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B "Section \*qDevice\*q"
.BI "  Identifier \*q"  devname \*q
.B  "  Driver \*qwsfb\*q"
\ \ ...
.B EndSection
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B wsfb
is an __xservername__ driver for OpenBSD and NetBSD
wsdisplay framebuffer devices.
This is a non-accelerated driver. 
The following framebuffer depths are supported: 1, 8, 16 and 24, given
that the wsdisplay device underneath supports them.
.br
A StaticGray monochrome visual is provided for depth 1,
all visual types are supported for depth 8 and a TrueColor visual is
supported for the other depths.
Multi-head configurations are supported.
.SH SUPPORTED HARDWARE
The
.B wsfb
driver supports all hardware where a wsdisplay framebuffer driver
is available on OpenBSD and NetBSD.
On OpenBSD, currently this includes OpenBSD/macppc, OpenBSD/sgi,
OpenBSD/sparc, OpenBSD/sparc64 and OpenBSD/alpha on TGA graphics cards.
It also supports NetBSD/i386 using wsdisplay on vesafb(4).
.SH CONFIGURATION DETAILS
Please refer to __xconfigfile__(__filemansuffix__) for general configuration
details.
This section only covers configuration details specific to this driver.
.PP
For this driver it is not required to specify modes in the 
.B Screen
section of the configuration file.
The
.B wsfb
driver picks up the currently used video mode from the framebuffer
driver and uses it.
Video modes specifications in the configuration file are ignored.
.PP
The following driver options are supported in the 
.B Device
section:
.TP
.BI "Option \*qdevice\*q \*q" string \*q
The wsdisplay framebuffer device to use.
Default for OpenBSD: \fI/dev/ttyC0\fP.
Default for NetBSD: \fI/dev/ttyE0\fP.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qShadowFB\*q \*q" boolean \*q
Enable or disable use of the shadow framebuffer layer.
See shadowfb(__drivermansuffix__) for further information.
Default: on for depths were it is supported, off otherwise.
.br
ShadowFB is currently not supported on monochrome displays.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qRotate\*q \*q" string \*q
Enable rotation of the display. The supported values are "CW" (clockwise,
90 degrees), "UD" (upside down, 180 degrees) and "CCW" (counter clockwise,
270 degrees).
Implies use of the shadow framebuffer layer.
Default: off.
