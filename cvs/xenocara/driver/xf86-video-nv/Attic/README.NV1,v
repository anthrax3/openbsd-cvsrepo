@           Information for NVidia NV1 / SGS-Thomson STG2000 Users

                                 David McKay

                               20th March 1997

1.  XFree driver for NVidia NV1 / SGS-Thomson STG2000 v1.0

This driver now accelerates bitblits and filled rectangles. It also support a
hardware cursor.  More graphic acceleration is planned. There is no plan to
support the audio functionality of the chip.

1.1  Notes

   o THE DRIVER DOES NOT SUPPORT THE VIRTUAL DESKTOP FEATURES OF XFREE86 This
     is because the NV1 does not have the necessary hardware to support this
     feature. If you want to change resolutions, you will have to modify your
     config file. Comment out all but the mode you wish to use.

   o The generic VGA16 server will not work with the NV1.  For this reason
     XF86Setup cannot be used to configure the server.  Use xf86config
     instead.  Select `Diamond Edge 3D' as your board, and select only ONE
     mode for each of 8bpp and 16bpp.  Do not select a virtual desktop.
     Also, make sure you don't select a RAMDAC or clock chip.

   o The NV1 only supports a 555 RGB Weight in 16 bpp, the hardware does not
     do 565. You must put a Weight 555 in the Display section.

   o 24/32 bpp mode is not yet supported.

1.2  Known Bugs

   o The driver should force Weight 555 in 16 bpp mode

   o The hardware cursor doesn't work if an doublescan mode is selected.

   o Screen blanking doesn't work, nor does DPMS.
