@Update the intel driver to (mostly) a backport of 2.12.

It is missing a few commits that I have yet to verify (ones that try and
continue if we lock the gpu rendering engine and can't reset it, for
example) taht will be verified and sent out for extra testing soon.

Should contain a bunch of speedups and some correctness improvements
(though rendercheck still gives some errors that I am looking into).

This has been in snaps since the first day of c2k10, any known issues
with just this driver have (to my knowledge) been fixed since. A problem
with macbooks pointed out by otto happens with both this and the in-tree
driver and thus doesn't stop this moving forward.

As well as the 2.12 improvements, this driver also has a backport
(partially aided by the backports in RHEL 5 kindly provided by Dave
Airlie) from the kms code of modesetting support for ironlake (arrandale
and clarkdale: the IGDs build into intel nehalem cpu dies) which has
been tested on a number of chipsets. Note that Display port and eDP
displays have not yet been worked on (and probably won't until I can
find a displayport monitor), but VGA and lvds at least are known to
work, sure beats vesa.

"no objection on my side" matthieu@@, prodding (as always) from princess
marco.
