@Update to xf86-video-intel 2.99.916
Fixes a display bug seenby ajacoutot@@, ok jsg@@ and kettenis@@.
newer X.Org (2.99.917 or master) version cause corruption on older
machines (X40, i965), probably caused by a bug in our kernel,
under investigation by kettenis@@.

.SH REPORTING BUGS

The xf86-video-intel driver is part of the X.Org and Freedesktop.org
umbrella projects.  Details on bug reporting can be found at
https://01.org/linuxgraphics/documentation/how-report-bugs.  Mailing
lists are also commonly used to report experiences and ask questions
about configuration and other topics.  See lists.freedesktop.org for
more information (the xorg@@lists.freedesktop.org mailing list is the
most appropriate place to ask X.Org and driver related questions).
