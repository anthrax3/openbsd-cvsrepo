1.1
log
@Update the intel driver to a more recent version based on more recent
upsteam code.

Backporting keeping UMS changes by me, some bugfixes from kettenis@@.

Has been in snapshots for a while, committed on request so we can be
sure what people are running. This is a prerequesite for sandybridge
support but has those chipsets disabled for now until the correct code
has been added.
