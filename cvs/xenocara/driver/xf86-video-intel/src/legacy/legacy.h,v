1.2
log
@- sync the "legacy" i810 driver, used only on true i810 and i815
  chipsets to the one in recent intel driver from X.Org.

- remove one of the output probe method in i830PreInit(). This method is
  calling functions that are normally forbidden in PreInit(). With
  xserver 1.13 this causes a fatal error at run time.

Tested by bluhm@@, nick@@ and shadchin@@ back in september.

1.1
log
@Update the intel driver to a more recent version based on more recent
upsteam code.

Backporting keeping UMS changes by me, some bugfixes from kettenis@@.

Has been in snapshots for a while, committed on request so we can be
sure what people are running. This is a prerequesite for sandybridge
support but has those chipsets disabled for now until the correct code
has been added.
