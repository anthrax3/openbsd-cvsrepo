@Pull in the changes in rendering that I skipped when i backported
changes from later intel versions (after the UMS removal). 95% of this
is the xvmc reworks that makes that code even halfway sane. xvmc is now
enabled by default on 965+.

Tested by many on tech@@, thanks!

@Update the intel driver to 2.9.1 plus backports.

2.9.1 is the last version of the intel DDX that supports UMS (User
modesetting), with 2.10 onwards being purely KMS only. As such, this
driver contains backports of almost every correctness or performance
related fix to the rendering layer in later intel drivers. This driver
*REQUIRES* a GEM enabled kernel. it claims to support non-gem mode but
this is essentially unmaintained and due to the way the abstraciton
works is slow, if it works at all (it often does not). You have been
warned.

tested by many many people on tech over the last few weeks.
