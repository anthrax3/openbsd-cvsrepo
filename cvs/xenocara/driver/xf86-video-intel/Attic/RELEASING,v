@Update to xf86-video-intel 2.99.909
Tested by jsg@@, kettenis@@ and myself on a wide range of intel cards.
@
text
@The process for releasing a new tarball is as follows:

1. Make sure you have the latest build requirements installed:

	git://git.freedesktop.org/git/util/macros
	git://git.freedesktop.org/git/util/modular

2. Add relevant release notes to the NEWS files

	Skim the git log since the last release, and add notes in a
	similar style to previous releases.

	For major releases list added features and known limitations.

	For minor releases indicate which bugs were fixed and which
	are still present.


3. Update your module version (usually found in configure.ac)

	$ vi configure.ac # bump version
	$ git commit
	$ git push origin # make sure you're on the release branch

4. Verify your module builds

	$ make distcheck

5. Tag the release

	$ git tag -m "Intel <ver> release" <ver>

6. Run the release script (this should push the tag)

	$ <path_to>/util/modular/release.sh driver <last_ver> <ver>

7. Edit and send the generated release message.

	At the very least, add the release notes from the NEWS file.

	The message is generated as xf86-video-intel-<version>.announce

	For snapshots and release candidates, mail to:

		intel-gfx@@lists.freedesktop.org

	For major releases also send to:

		xorg@@lists.freedesktop.org
		xorg-announce@@lists.freedesktop.org

8. Throw a release party, you're done! :)

@Update the intel driver to 2.9.1 plus backports.

2.9.1 is the last version of the intel DDX that supports UMS (User
modesetting), with 2.10 onwards being purely KMS only. As such, this
driver contains backports of almost every correctness or performance
related fix to the rendering layer in later intel drivers. This driver
*REQUIRES* a GEM enabled kernel. it claims to support non-gem mode but
this is essentially unmaintained and due to the way the abstraciton
works is slow, if it works at all (it often does not). You have been
warned.

tested by many many people on tech over the last few weeks.
