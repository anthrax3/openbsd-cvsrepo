.SH CONFIGURATION DETAILS
Please refer to __xconfigfile__(__filemansuffix__) for general configuration
details.  This section only covers configuration details specific to this
driver.
.PP
The following driver
.B Options
are supported:
.TP
.BI "Option \*qSWcursor\*q \*q" boolean \*q
Selects software cursor.  The default is
.B off.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qAccel\*q \*q" boolean \*q
Enables or disables all hardware acceleration.
.br
The default is
.B on.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qZaphodHeads\*q \*q" string \*q
Specify the RandR output(s) to use with zaphod mode for a particular driver
instance.  If you use this option you must use this option for all instances
of the driver.
.br
For example:
.B
Option \*qZaphodHeads\*q \*qLVDS,VGA-0\*q
will assign xrandr outputs LVDS and VGA-0 to this instance of the driver.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qColorTiling\*q \*q" "boolean" \*q
The framebuffer can be addressed either in linear or tiled mode. Tiled mode can provide
significant performance benefits with 3D applications.  Tiling will be disabled if the drm
module is too old or if the current display configuration does not support it.  On R600+
this enables 1D tiling mode.
.br
The default value is
.B on
for R/RV3XX, R/RV4XX, R/RV5XX, RS6XX, RS740, R/RV6XX, R/RV7XX, RS780, RS880,
EVERGREEN, CAYMAN, ARUBA, Southern Islands, and Sea Islands and
.B off
for R/RV/RS1XX, R/RV/RS2XX, RS3XX, and RS690/RS780/RS880 when fast fb feature is enabled.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qColorTiling2D\*q \*q" "boolean" \*q
The framebuffer can be addressed either in linear, 1D, or 2D tiled modes. 2D tiled mode can
provide significant performance benefits over 1D tiling with 3D applications.  Tiling
will be disabled if the drm module is too old or if the current display configuration
does not support it. KMS ColorTiling2D is only supported on R600 and newer chips and requires
Mesa 9.0 or newer for R6xx-ARUBA, Mesa 9.2 or newer for Southern Islands, and Mesa
10.1 or newer for Sea Islands.
.br
The default value is
.B on
for R/RV6XX, R/RV7XX, RS780, RS880, EVERGREEN, CAYMAN, ARUBA, Southern Islands, and
Sea Islands.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qDRI\*q \*q" integer \*q
Define the maximum level of DRI to enable. Valid values are 2 for DRI2 or 3 for DRI3.
The default is
.B 2 for DRI2.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qEnablePageFlip\*q \*q" boolean \*q
Enable DRI2 page flipping.  The default is
.B on.
Pageflipping is supported on all radeon hardware.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qTearFree\*q \*q" boolean \*q
Enable tearing prevention using the hardware page flipping mechanism. This
option currently doesn't have any effect for CRTCs using transforms other than
rotation or reflection. It requires allocating two separate scanout buffers for
each supported CRTC. Enabling this option currently disables Option
\*qEnablePageFlip\*q. The default is
.B off.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qAccelMethod\*q \*q" "string" \*q
Chooses between available acceleration architectures.  Valid values are
.B EXA
(for pre-TAHITI GPUs) and
.B glamor
(for R300 or higher). The default is
.B glamor
as of TAHITI, otherwise
.B EXA.

.PP
The following driver
.B Options
are supported for
.B glamor
:
.TP
.BI "Option \*qShadowPrimary\*q \*q" boolean \*q
This option enables a so-called "shadow primary" buffer for fast CPU access to
pixel data, and separate scanout buffers for each display controller (CRTC).
This may improve performance for some 2D workloads, potentially at the expense
of other (e.g. 3D, video) workloads.
Note in particular that enabling this option currently disables page flipping.
The default is
.B off.

.PP
The following driver
.B Options
are supported for
.B EXA
:
.TP
.BI "Option \*qEXAVSync\*q \*q" boolean \*q
This option attempts to avoid tearing by stalling the engine until the display
controller has passed the destination region.  It reduces tearing at the cost
of performance and has been known to cause instability on some chips.
The default is
.B off.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qEXAPixmaps\*q \*q" boolean \*q
Under KMS, to avoid thrashing pixmaps in/out of VRAM on low memory cards,
we use a heuristic based on VRAM amount to determine whether to allow EXA
to use VRAM for non-essential pixmaps.  This option allows us to override the
heuristic.  The default is
.B on
with > 32MB VRAM, off with < 32MB or when fast fb feature is enabled for RS690/RS780/RS880.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qSwapbuffersWait\*q \*q" boolean \*q
This option controls the behavior of glXSwapBuffers and glXCopySubBufferMESA
calls by GL applications.  If enabled, the calls will avoid tearing by making
sure the display scanline is outside of the area to be copied before the copy
occurs.  If disabled, no scanline synchronization is performed, meaning tearing
will likely occur.  Note that when enabled, this option can adversely affect
the framerate of applications that render frames at less than refresh rate.
.IP
The default value is
.B on.

.SH TEXTURED VIDEO ATTRIBUTES
The driver supports the following X11 Xv attributes for Textured Video.
You can use the "xvattr" tool to query/set those attributes at runtime.

.TP
.BI "XV_VSYNC"
XV_VSYNC is used to control whether textured adapter synchronizes
the screen update to the monitor vertical refresh to eliminate tearing.
It has two values: 'off'(0) and 'on'(1). The default is
.B 'on'(1).

.TP
.BI "XV_CRTC"
XV_CRTC is used to control which display controller (crtc) the textured
adapter synchronizes the screen update with when XV_VSYNC is enabled.
The default, 'auto'(-1), will sync to the display controller that more
of the video is on; when this is ambiguous, the display controller associated
with the RandR primary output is preferred.  This attribute is useful for
things like clone mode where the user can best decide which display should be
synced.
The default is
.B 'auto'(-1).

.TP
.BI "XV_BICUBIC"
XV_BICUBIC is used to control whether textured adapter should apply
a bicubic filter to smooth the output. It has three values: 'off'(0), 'on'(1)
and 'auto'(2). 'off' means never apply the filter, 'on' means always apply
the filter and 'auto' means apply the filter only if the X and Y
sizes are scaled to more than double to avoid blurred output.  Bicubic
filtering is not currently compatible with other Xv attributes like hue,
contrast, and brightness, and must be disabled to use those attributes.
The default is
.B 'off'(0).

This option attempts to avoid tearing by stalling the engine until the display
controller has passed the destination region.  It reduces tearing at the cost
of performance and has been known to cause instability on some chips.

Pageflipping is supported on all radeon hardware.
.PP
The following driver
.B Options
are supported for
.B UMS
(Userspace Modesetting):
.TP
.BI "Option \*qDac6Bit\*q \*q" boolean \*q
Enables or disables the use of 6 bits per color component when in 8 bpp
mode (emulates VGA mode).  By default, all 8 bits per color component
are used.
.br
The default is
.B off.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qVideoKey\*q \*q" integer \*q
This overrides the default pixel value for the YUV video overlay key.
.br
The default value is
.B 0x1E.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qScalerWidth\*q \*q" integer \*q
This sets the overlay scaler buffer width. Accepted values range from
1024 to 2048, divisible by 64.  Values other than 1536 and 1920 may
not make sense.  This should be set automatically, but no one knows
what the limit is for which chip. If you think quality is not optimal
when playing back HD video (with horizontal resolution larger than
this setting), increase this value.  If you get an empty area at the
right (usually pink), decrease it. Note that this only affects the "true"
overlay via Xv, and won't affect things like textured video.
.br
The default value is either 1536 (for most chips) or 1920.
.TP

.br
The default is to
.B leave it unchanged.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qAGPFastWrite\*q \*q" boolean \*q
Enable AGP fast writes.  Enabling this is frequently the cause of
instability. Used only when the DRI is enabled. If you enable
this option you will get *NO* support from developers.
.br
The default is
.B off.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qBusType\*q \*q" string \*q
Used to replace previous ForcePCIMode option.
Should only be used when driver's bus detection is incorrect
or you want to force an AGP card to PCI mode. You should NEVER force
a PCI card to AGP bus.
.br
PCI    \-\- PCI bus
.br
AGP    \-\- AGP bus
.br
PCIE   \-\- PCI Express bus
.br
(used only when DRI is enabled)
.br
The default is
.B auto detect.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qDisplayPriority\*q \*q" string \*q
.br
Used to prevent flickering or tearing problem caused by display buffer underflow.
.br
AUTO   \-\- Driver calculated (default).
.br
BIOS   \-\- Remain unchanged from BIOS setting.
          Use this if the calculation is not correct
          for your card.
.br
HIGH   \-\- Force to the highest priority.
          Use this if you have problem with above options.
          This may affect performance slightly.
.br
The default value is
.B AUTO.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qColorTiling\*q \*q" "boolean" \*q
The framebuffer can be addressed either in linear or tiled mode. Tiled mode can provide
significant performance benefits with 3D applications.  For 2D it shouldn't matter
much. Tiling will be disabled if the virtual x resolution exceeds 2048 (3968 for R300 
and above), or if DRI is enabled and the drm module is too old.
.br
If this option is enabled, a new DRI driver is required for direct rendering.
.br
Color tiling will be automatically disabled in interlaced or doublescan screen modes.
.br
The default value is
.B on.
.TP 
.BI "Option \*qIgnoreEDID\*q \*q" boolean \*q
Do not use EDID data for mode validation.  DDC is still used
for monitor detection. This is different from NoDDC option.
.br
The default value is
.B off.
.TP 
.BI "Option \*qCustomEDID\*q \*q" string \*q
Forces the X driver to use the EDID data specified in a file rather
than the display's EDID. Also overrides DDC monitor detection.
.br
You may specify a semicolon-separated list of output name and filename pairs
with an optional flag, "digital" or "analog", to override the digital bit in
the EDID which is used by the driver to determine whether to use the
analog or digital encoder associated with a DVI-I port.
The output name is the RandR output name, e.g., "VGA-0" or "DVI-0";
consult the Xorg log for the supported output names of any given system.
.br
The file must contain a raw 128-byte EDID block, as captured by
.B
get-edid.
.br
For example:
.B
Option \*qCustomEDID\*q \*qVGA-0:/tmp/edid1.bin; DVI-0:/tmp/edid2.bin:digital\*q
will assign the EDID from the file /tmp/edid1.bin to the output device
VGA-0, and the EDID from the file /tmp/edid2.bin to the output device
DVI-0 and force the DVI port to use the digital encoder.
.br
Note that an output name must always be specified,
even if only one EDID is specified.
.br
.B
Caution:
Specifying an EDID that doesn't exactly match your display may
damage your hardware, as it allows the driver to specify timings beyond
the capabilities of your display. Use with care.
.TP 
.BI "Option \*qPanelSize\*q \*q" "string" \*q
Should only be used when driver cannot detect the correct panel size.
Apply to both desktop (TMDS) and laptop (LVDS) digital panels.
When a valid panel size is specified, the timings collected from
DDC and BIOS will not be used. If you have a panel with timings
different from that of a standard VESA mode, you have to provide
this information through the Modeline.
.br
For example, Option "PanelSize" "1400x1050"
.br
The default value is
.B none.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qEnablePageFlip\*q \*q" boolean \*q
Enable page flipping for 3D acceleration. This will increase performance
but not work correctly in some rare cases, hence the default is
.B off.
It is currently only supported on R/RV/RS4xx and older hardware.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qForceMinDotClock\*q \*q" frequency \*q
Override minimum dot clock. Some Radeon BIOSes report a minimum dot
clock unsuitable (too high) for use with television sets even when they
actually can produce lower dot clocks. If this is the case you can
override the value here.
.B Note that using this option may damage your hardware.
You have been warned. The
.B frequency
parameter may be specified as a float value with standard suffixes like
"k", "kHz", "M", "MHz".
.TP
.BI "Option \*qRenderAccel\*q \*q" boolean \*q
Enables or disables hardware Render acceleration.  It is supported on all
Radeon cards when using EXA acceleration and on Radeon R/RV/RS1xx,
R/RV/RS2xx and RS3xx when using XAA.  The default is to
.B enable
Render acceleration.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qAccelMethod\*q \*q" "string" \*q
Chooses between available acceleration architectures.  Valid options are
.B XAA
and
.B EXA.
XAA is the traditional acceleration architecture and support for it is very
stable.  EXA is a newer acceleration architecture with better performance for
the Render and Composite extensions.  The default is
.B EXA.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qAccelDFS\*q \*q" boolean \*q
Use or don't use accelerated EXA DownloadFromScreen hook when possible (only
when Direct Rendering is enabled, e.g.).
Default:
.B off
with AGP due to issues with GPU->host transfers with some AGP bridges,
.B on
otherwise.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qFBTexPercent\*q \*q" integer \*q
Amount of video RAM to reserve for OpenGL textures, in percent. With EXA, the
remainder of video RAM is reserved for EXA offscreen management. Specifying 0
results in all offscreen video RAM being reserved for EXA and only GART memory
being available for OpenGL textures. This may improve EXA performance, but
beware that it may cause problems with OpenGL drivers from Mesa versions older
than 6.4. With XAA, specifying lower percentage than what gets reserved without
this option has no effect, but the driver tries to increase the video RAM
reserved for textures to the amount specified roughly.
Default:
.B 50.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qDepthBits\*q \*q" integer \*q
Precision in bits per pixel of the shared depth buffer used for 3D acceleration.
Valid values are 16 and 24. When this is 24, there will also be a hardware
accelerated stencil buffer, but the combined depth/stencil buffer will take up
twice as much video RAM as when it's 16.
Default:
.B The same as the screen depth.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qDMAForXv\*q \*q" boolean \*q
Try or don't try to use DMA for Xv image transfers. This will reduce CPU
usage when playing big videos like DVDs, but may cause instabilities.
Default:
.B on.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qSubPixelOrder\*q \*q" "string" \*q
Force subpixel order to specified order.
Subpixel order is used for subpixel decimation on flat panels.
.br
NONE   \-\- No subpixel (CRT like displays)
.br
RGB    \-\- in horizontal RGB order (most flat panels)
.br
BGR    \-\- in horizontal BGR order (some flat panels)

.br
This option is intended to be used in following cases:
.br
1. The default subpixel order is incorrect for your panel.
.br
2. Enable subpixel decimation on analog panels.
.br
3. Adjust to one display type in dual-head clone mode setup.
.br
4. Get better performance with Render acceleration on
digital panels (use NONE setting).
.br
The default is 
.B NONE 
for CRT, 
.B RGB 
for digital panels
.TP
.BI "Option \*qClockGating\*q \*q" boolean \*q
Enable dynamic clock gating.  This can help reduce heat and increase battery
life by reducing power usage.  Some users report reduced 3D performance
with this enabled.  The default is
.B off.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qForceLowPowerMode\*q \*q" boolean \*q
Enable a static low power mode.  This can help reduce heat and increase battery
life by reducing power usage at the expense of performance. The default is
.B off.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qDynamicPM\*q \*q" boolean \*q
Enable dynamic power mode switching.  This can help reduce heat and increase battery
life by reducing power usage when the system is idle (DPMS active). The default is
.B off.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qVGAAccess\*q \*q" boolean \*q
Tell the driver if it can do legacy VGA IOs to the card. This is
necessary for properly resuming consoles when in VGA text mode, but
shouldn't be if the console is using radeonfb or some other graphic
mode driver. Some platforms like PowerPC have issues with those, and they aren't
necessary unless you have a real text mode in console. The default is
.B off
on PowerPC and SPARC and
.B on
on other architectures.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qReverseDDC\*q \*q" boolean \*q
When BIOS connector information isn't available, use this option to
reverse the mapping of the two main DDC ports. Use this if the X server
obviously detects the wrong display for each connector. This is
typically needed on the Radeon 9600 cards bundled with Apple G5s. The
default is
.B off.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qLVDSProbePLL\*q \*q" boolean \*q
When BIOS panel information isn't available (like on PowerBooks), it
may still be necessary to use the firmware-provided PLL values for the
panel or flickering will happen. This option will force probing of
the current value programmed in the chip when X is launched in that
case.  This is only useful for LVDS panels (laptop internal panels).
The default is
.B on.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qTVDACLoadDetect\*q \*q" boolean \*q
Enable load detection on the TV DAC.  The TV DAC is used to drive both
TV-out and analog monitors. Load detection is often unreliable in the
TV DAC so it is disabled by default.
The default is
.B off.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qDefaultTMDSPLL\*q \*q" boolean \*q
Use the default driver provided TMDS PLL values rather than the ones
provided by the BIOS. This option has no effect on Mac cards.  Enable
this option if you are having problems with a DVI monitor using the
internal TMDS controller.
The default is
.B off.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qDefaultTVDACAdj\*q \*q" boolean \*q
Use the default driver provided TVDAC Adj values rather than the ones
provided by the BIOS. This option has no effect on Mac cards.  Enable
this option if you are having problems with a washed out display on
the secondary DAC.
The default is
.B off.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qDRI\*q \*q" boolean \*q
Enable DRI support.  This option allows you to enable to disable the DRI.
The default is
.B off 
for RN50/ES1000 and
.B on 
for others.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qDefaultConnectorTable\*q \*q" boolean \*q
Enable this option to skip the BIOS connector table parsing and use the
driver defaults for each chip.
The default is
.B off 
.TP
.BI "Option \*qMacModel\*q \*q" string \*q
.br
Used to specify Mac models for connector tables and quirks.  If you have
a PowerBook or Mini with DVI that does not work properly, try the alternate
options as Apple does not seem to provide a good way of knowing whether
they use internal or external TMDS for DVI.  Only valid on PowerPC.
On Linux, the driver will attempt to detect the MacModel automatically.
.br
ibook                \-\- ibooks
.br
powerbook-external   \-\- Powerbooks with external DVI
.br

.br
The default value is
.B undefined.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qTVStandard\*q \*q" string \*q
.br
Used to specify the default TV standard if you want to use something other than
the BIOS default. Valid options are:
.br
ntsc
.br
pal
.br
pal-m
.br
pal-60
.br
ntsc-j
.br
scart-pal
.br
The default value is
.B undefined.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qForceTVOut\*q \*q" boolean \*q
Enable this option to force TV-out to always be detected as attached.
The default is
.B off 
.TP
.BI "Option \*qIgnoreLidStatus\*q \*q" boolean \*q
Enable this option to ignore lid status on laptops and always detect
LVDS as attached.
The default is
.B on. 
.TP
.BI "Option \*qInt10\*q \*q" boolean \*q
This option allows you to disable INT10 initialization.  Set this to
False if you are experiencing a hang when initializing a secondary card.
The default is
.B on.
.TP 
.BI "Option \*qATOMTvOut\*q \*q" boolean \*q
This option enables experimental TV-out support for R/RV5xx, R/RV6xx, and R/RV7xx
AtomBIOS chips. TV-out is experimental and may not function on these chips as
well as hoped for.
The default is
.B off.
.TP 
.BI "Option \*qR4xxATOM\*q \*q" boolean \*q
This option enables modesetting on R/RV4xx chips using AtomBIOS.
The default is
.B off.

Specify the RandR output(s) to use with zaphod mode for a particular driver
instance.  If you use this option you must use this option for all instances
of the driver.

For example:

Option \*qZaphodHeads\*q \*qLVDS,VGA-0\*q
will assign xrandr outputs LVDS and VGA-0 to this instance of the driver.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qEXAVSync\*q \*q" boolean \*q
This option attempts to avoid tearing by stalling the engine until the display
controller has passed the destination region.  It reduces tearing at the cost
of performance and has been known to cause instability on some chips.
The default is
.B off.

.PP
The following driver
.B Options
are supported for
.B KMS
(Kernel Modesetting):
.TP
.BI "Option \*qColorTiling\*q \*q" "boolean" \*q
The framebuffer can be addressed either in linear or tiled mode. Tiled mode can provide
significant performance benefits with 3D applications.  Tiling will be disabled if the drm
module is too old or if the current display configuration does not support it. KMS
ColorTiling is not currently supported on R/RV/RS1XX, R/RV/RS2XX, and RS3XX.
.br
The default value is
.B on
for R/RV3XX, R/RV4XX, R/RV5XX, RS6XX, RS740, R/RV6XX, R/RV7XX, RS780, RS880,
EVERGREEN, and CAYMAN.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qEXAPixmaps\*q \*q" boolean \*q
Under KMS, to avoid thrashing pixmaps in/out of VRAM on low memory cards,
we use a heuristic based on VRAM amount to determine whether to allow EXA
to use VRAM for non-essential pixmaps.  This option allows us to override the
heuristic.  The default is
.B on
with > 32MB VRAM, off with < 32MB.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qSwapbuffersWait\*q \*q" boolean \*q
This option controls the behavior of glXSwapBuffers and glXCopySubBufferMESA
calls by GL applications.  If enabled, the calls will avoid tearing by making
sure the display scanline is outside of the area to be copied before the copy
occurs.  If disabled, no scanline synchronization is performed, meaning tearing
will likely occur.  Note that when enabled, this option can adversely affect
the framerate of applications that render frames at less than refresh rate.
.IP
The default value is
.B on.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qEnablePageFlip\*q \*q" boolean \*q
Enable DRI2 page flipping.  The default is

Pageflipping is supported on all radeon hardware.

This sets the overlay scaler buffer width. Accepted values range from
1024 to 2048, divisible by 64.  Values other than 1536 and 1920 may
not make sense.  This should be set automatically, but no one knows
what the limit is for which chip. If you think quality is not optimal
when playing back HD video (with horizontal resolution larger than
this setting), increase this value.  If you get an empty area at the
right (usually pink), decrease it. Note that this only affects the "true"
overlay via Xv, and won't affect things like textured video.

.BI "Option \*qCustomEDID\*q \*q" string \*q
Forces the X driver to use the EDID data specified in a file rather
than the display's EDID. Also overrides DDC monitor detection.
.br
You may specify a semicolon-separated list of output name and filename pairs
with an optional flag, "digital" or "analog", to override the digital bit in
the EDID which is used by the driver to determine whether to use the
analog or digital encoder associated with a DVI-I port.
The output name is the RandR output name, e.g., "VGA-0" or "DVI-0";
consult the Xorg log for the supported output names of any given system.
.br
The file must contain a raw 128-byte EDID block, as captured by
.B
get-edid.
.br
For example:
.B
Option \*qCustomEDID\*q \*qVGA-0:/tmp/edid1.bin; DVI-0:/tmp/edid2.bin:digital\*q
will assign the EDID from the file /tmp/edid1.bin to the output device
VGA-0, and the EDID from the file /tmp/edid2.bin to the output device
DVI-0 and force the DVI port to use the digital encoder.
.br
Note that an output name must always be specified,
even if only one EDID is specified.
.br
.B
Caution:
Specifying an EDID that doesn't exactly match your display may
damage your hardware, as it allows the driver to specify timings beyond
the capabilities of your display. Use with care.

.BI "Option \*qMergedFB\*q \*q" boolean \*q
This enables merged framebuffer mode.  In this mode you have a single 
shared framebuffer with two viewports looking into it.  It is similar
to Xinerama, but has some advantages.  It is faster than Xinerama, the
DRI works on both heads, and it supports clone modes.  
.br
Merged framebuffer mode provides two linked viewports looking into a
single large shared framebuffer.  The size of the framebuffer is 
determined by the
.B Virtual
keyword defined on the
.B Screen
section of your __xconfigfile__ file.  It works just like regular virtual
desktop except you have two viewports looking into it instead of one.
.br
For example, if you wanted a desktop composed of two 1024x768 viewports
looking into a single desktop you would create a virtual desktop of 
2048x768 (left/right) or 1024x1536 (above/below), e.g.,
.br
.B Virtual 2048 768
or
.B Virtual 1024 1536
.br
The virtual desktop can be larger than larger than the size of the viewports
looking into it.  In this case the linked viewports will scroll around in the 
virtual desktop.  Viewports with different sizes are also supported (e.g., one
that is 1024x768 and one that is 640x480).  In this case the smaller viewport
will scroll relative to the larger one such that none of the virtual desktop 
is inaccessible.  If you do not define a virtual desktop the driver will create
one based on the orientation of the heads and size of the largest defined mode in 
the display section that is supported on each head.
.br
The relation of the viewports in specified by the
.B CRT2Position
Option.  The options are
.B Clone
,
.B LeftOf
,
.B RightOf
,
.B Above
, and
.B Below.  
MergedFB is enabled by default if a monitor is detected on each output.  If 
no position is given it defaults to clone mode (the old clone options are now 
deprecated, also, the option OverlayOnCRTC2 has been replaced by the Xv 
attribute XV_SWITCHCRT; the overlay can be switched to CRT1 or CRT2 on the fly 
in clone mode).
.br
The maximum framebuffer size that the 2D acceleration engine can handle is 
8192x8192.  The maximum framebuffer size that the 3D engine can handle is 
2048x2048.
.br

Page flipping does not work well in certain configurations with MergedFB.  If you 
see rendering errors or other strange behavior, disable page flipping. Also MergedFB

.br
For example, Option "CRT2VRefresh" "50.0-120.0"
.br
The default value is
.B undefined.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qCRT2Position\*q \*q" "string" \*q
Set the relationship of CRT2 relative to CRT1. Valid options are: 
.B Clone
,
.B LeftOf
,
.B RightOf
,
.B Above
, and
.B Below
.
.br
For example, Option "CRT2Position" "RightOf"
.br
This option also supports an offset.  This is most useful when
.B MergedNonRectangular 
is enabled.  For example if you want CRT2 to be offset 100 pixels down from 
the start of CRT1, you'd type:
.br
Option "CRT2Position" "LeftOf 100"
.br
The offset is vertical for LeftOf and RightOf and horizontal for Above and 
Below.  Offsets can be positive or negative.
.br
The default value is
.B Clone.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qMetaModes\*q \*q" "string" \*q
MetaModes are mode combinations for CRT1 and CRT2.  If you are using merged
frame buffer mode and want to change modes (CTRL-ALT-+/-), these define which
modes will be switched to on CRT1 and CRT2.  The MetaModes are defined as 
CRT1Mode-CRT2Mode (800x600-1024x768).  Modes listed individually (800x600) 
define clone modes, that way you can mix clone modes with non-clone modes. 
Also some programs require "standard" modes.  If you want to add clone modes 
of different refreshes or sizes to the mix, they are defined as CRT1Mode+CRT2Mode 
(800x600+1024x768).
.br
Note:  Any mode you use in the MetaModes must be defined in the
.B Screen 
section of your __xconfigfile__ file.  Modes not defined there will be ignored when
the MetaModes are parsed since the driver uses them to make sure the monitors can 
handle those modes.  If you do not define a MetaMode the driver will create
one based on the orientation of the heads and size of the largest defined mode in 
the display section that is supported on each head.
.br
.B Modes "1024x768" "800x600" "640x480"
.br
For example, Option "MetaModes" "1024x768-1024x768 800x600-1024x768 640x480-800x600 800x600"
.br
The default value is
.B undefined.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qMergedXinerama\*q \*q" boolean \*q
Since merged framebuffer mode does not use Xinerama, apps are not able to intelligently
place windows.  Merged framebuffer mode provides its own pseudo-Xinerama.  This allows
Xinerama compliant applications to place windows appropriately.  There are some caveats.
Since merged framebuffer mode is able to change relative screen sizes and orientations on
the fly, as well has having overlapping viewports, pseudo-Xinerama, might not always 
provide the right hints.  Also many Xinerama compliant applications only query Xinerama
once at startup; if the information changes, they may not be aware of the change.  If
you are already using Xinerama (e.g., a single head card and a dualhead card providing
three heads), pseudo-Xinerama will be disabled.
.br
This option allows you turn off the driver provided pseudo-Xinerama extension.
.br
The default value is
.B TRUE.
.TP 
.BI "Option \*qMergedXineramaCRT2IsScreen0\*q \*q" boolean \*q
By default the pseudo-Xinerama provided by the driver makes the left-most or bottom
head Xinerama screen 0.  Certain Xinerama-aware applications do special things with 
screen 0.  To change that behavior, use this option.
.br
The default value is
.B undefined.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qMergedDPI\*q \*q" "string" \*q
The driver will attempt to figure out an appropriate DPI based on the DDC information
and the orientation of the heads when in merged framebuffer mode.  If this value does 
not suit you, you can manually set the DPI using this option.
.br
For example, Option "MergedDPI" "100 100"
.br
The default value is
.B undefined.
.TP
.BI "Option \*qMergedNonRectangular\*q \*q" boolean \*q
If you are using MergedFB with two modes of different sizes, turn this option on to 
keep the smaller head from scrolling within the larger virtual desktop and to keep 
the mouse from moving into that area.  Applications that are not Xinerama aware can 
potentially end up stranded in this area.
.br
The default value is
.B FALSE.

.BI "Option \*qBIOSHotkeys\*q \*q" boolean \*q
Enable BIOS hotkey output switching. This allows the BIOS to toggle outputs
using hotkeys (e.g., fn-f7, etc.).  Since the driver does not support ACPI, 
there is no way to validate modes on an output switch and the BIOS can 
potentially change things behind the driver's back.  The default is
.B off.
