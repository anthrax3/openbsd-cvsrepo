@Update to xf86-video-ati 7.2.0, requested by jsg@@

It fixes an endianess problem with kms and the in tree x86-video-ati
among other things.
It has been tested on various i386/amd64/sparc64/macppc machines
on a range of hardware from r100->northern islands.

@Long awaited update of xf86-video-ati to 6.9.0.

the rage128 and mach64 drivers were split out of this driver just after
the 6.8.0 release, these drivers will be commited separately.

MergedFb mode is gone, so please use xrandr if you used to use it.

ok matthieu@@.
