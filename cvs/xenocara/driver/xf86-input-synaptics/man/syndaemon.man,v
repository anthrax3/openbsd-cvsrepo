.TH syndaemon __appmansuffix__ __vendorversion__
.SH NAME
.LP
syndaemon \- a program that monitors keyboard activity and disables
the touchpad when the keyboard is being used.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.LP
syndaemon [\fI\-i idle\-time\fP] [\fI\-m poll-inverval\fP] [\fI\-d\fP] [\fI\-p pid\-file\fP]
[\fI\-t\fP] [\fI\-k\fP] [\fI\-K\fP] [\fI\-R\fP]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.LP
Disabling the touchpad while typing avoids unwanted movements of the
pointer that could lead to giving focus to the wrong window.
.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.LP
.TP
\fB\-i\fR <\fIidle\-time\fP>
How many seconds to wait after the last key press before enabling the
touchpad.
.
(default is 2.0s). 
.LP
.TP
\fB\-m\fR <\fIpoll\-interval\fP>
How many milliseconds to wait between two polling intervals. If this value is
too low, it will cause unnecessary wake-ups. If this value is too high,
some key presses (press and release happen between two intervals) may not
be noticed. This switch has no effect when running with
\fB-R\fP.
.
Default is 200ms.
.LP
.TP
\fB\-d\fP
Start as a daemon, ie in the background.
.LP
.TP
\fB\-p\fR <\fIpid\-file\fP>
Create a pid file with the specified filename.
.
A pid file will only be created if the program is started in daemon
mode.
.LP
.TP
\fB\-t\fP
Only disable tapping and scrolling, not mouse movements, in response
to keyboard activity.
.LP
.TP
\fB\-k\fP
Ignore modifier keys when monitoring keyboard activity.
.LP
.TP
\fB\-K\fP
Like \-k but also ignore Modifier+Key combos.
.LP
.TP
\fB\-R\fP
Use the XRecord extension for detecting keyboard activity instead of polling
the keyboard state.
.LP
.TP
\fB\-?\fP
Show the help message.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
.LP
.TP
\fBDISPLAY\fP
Specifies the X server to contact.
.SH EXIT CODES
If syndaemon exists with a return code other than 0, the error encountered
is as below.
.LP
.TP
\fBExit code 1
Invalid commandline argument.
.LP
.TP
\fBExit code 2
The connection to the X sever could not be established or no touchpad device
could be found.
.LP
.TP
\fBExit code 3
The fork into daemon mode failed or the pid file could not be created.
.LP
.TP
\fBExit code 4
XRECORD requested but not available or usable on the server.
.SH "CAVEATS"
.LP
It doesn't make much sense to connect to a remote X server, because
the daemon will then monitor the remote server for keyboard activity,
but will disable the touchpad on the local machine.
.SH "AUTHORS"
.LP
Peter Osterlund <petero2@@telia.com>.
.TP
This man page was written by Mattia Dongili <malattia@@debian.org>
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.LP

\fB\-s\fP
Use a shared memory area to enable/disable the touchpad instead of device
properties. WARNING: The SHM mechanism is not secure if you are in an untrusted multiuser
environment. All local users can change the parameters at any time. This
option requires the driver Option "SHMConfig" to be enabled.
