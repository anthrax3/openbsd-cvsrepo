For the -m and -h options, SHM must be enabled by setting the option SHMConfig
"on" in your XOrg/XFree86 configuration.

\fB\-m interval\fR
monitor changes to the touchpad state.
.
Interval specifies how often (in ms) to poll the touchpad state.
.
Whenever a change in the touchpad state is detected, one line of
output is generated that describes the current state of the touchpad.
This option is only available in SHM mode.
.
The following data is included in the output.
.RS
.TP
\fBtime\fR
Time in seconds since the logging was started.
.TP
\fBx,y\fR
The x/y coordinates of the finger on the touchpad.
.
The origin is in the upper left corner.
.TP
\fBz\fR
The "pressure" value.
.
Pressing the finger harder on the touchpad typically produces a larger
value.
.
Note that most touchpads don't measure the real pressure though.
.
Instead, capacitance is usually measured, which is correlated to the
contact area between the finger and the touchpad.
.
Since more pressure usually means a larger contact area, the reported
pressure value is at least indirectly related to the real pressure.
.TP
\fBf\fR
The number of fingers currently touching the touchpad.
.
Note that only some touchpads can report more than one finger.
.
Generally, synaptics touchpads can, but ALPS touchpads can't.
.TP
\fBw\fR
The w value is a measurement of the finger width.
.
This is only supported by some synaptics touchpads.
.
Touchpads that can't measure the finger width typically report a faked
constant value when a finger is touching the touchpad.
.TP
\fBl,r,u,d,m,multi\fR
The state of the left, right, up, down, middle and multi buttons.
.
Zero means not pressed, one means pressed.
.
Not all touchpads have all these buttons.
.
If a button doesn't exist, the value is always reported as 0.
