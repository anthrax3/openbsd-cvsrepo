This is a 100dpi, 24 point (approximately) font that is meant to act as
an example of what glyphs are needed to minimally support (almost) all
of the Arabic characters available in Unicode.

The encoding of this font is the encoding of Arabic from Unicode 2.0
with the addition of some contextual forms and some other convenient
glyphs that do not exist in Unicode.  An additional file, "uniarab.txt",
has been provided to describe the encoding of the extra contextual
glyphs.
