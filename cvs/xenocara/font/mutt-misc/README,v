Version: 1.9

This set of fonts provides a 12pt, 100dpi proportional font with many of
the glyphs needed for Unicode text.  I call the typeface "ClearlyU" and
it was influenced by Donald Knuth's Computer Modern.
d7 1
a7 3
The fonts together contain 9538 glyphs at the moment.  This does not include
cuarabic12.bdf and cudevnag12.bdf which contain glyphs from cu12.bdf and and
cu-pua12.bdf.
