.Dt XIDLE 1
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm xidle
.Nd run a program on X inactivity
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm xidle
.Bk -words
.Op Fl area Ar pixels
.Op Fl delay Ar secs
.Op Fl display Ar display
.Op Fl nw | ne | sw | se
.Op Fl program Ar path
.Op Fl timeout Ar secs
.Ek
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
uses the
.Xr XScreenSaver 3
extension to receive inactivity events when a timeout is specified, running
a specific program after the elapsed time.
.Nm
will also run the program if it is sent a
.Dv SIGUSR1
signal, or if the pointer sits in a corner of the screen for
an amount of time.
Signal and corner locking are always enabled, whether
.Fl timeout
is specified or not.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl area Ar pixels
Specify the size, in pixels, of the corner area.
The default is 2 pixels.
.It Fl delay Ar secs
Specify the number of seconds the pointer has to be in the given position
before running the program.
The default is 2 seconds.
.It Fl display Ar display
This argument allows you to specify the server to connect to; see
.Xr X 7 .
.It Fl nw | ne | sw | se
Set the position to one of northwest, northeast, southwest, or southeast,
respectively.
If no position is specified,
the default is northwest.
.It Fl program Ar path
Specify the full pathname of the program to run on any of the
aforementioned events.
Arguments to the program may also be specified, separated by whitespace.
If
.Fl program
is not specified, the default is
.Xr xlock 1 .
.It Fl timeout Ar secs
Set the timeout to the specified number of seconds.
If
.Fl timeout
is not specified,
.Nm
won't run any program on inactivity.
.El
.Sh RESOURCES
A few sets of application specific resources are supported and their values
can be overriden by the command line options:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Sy area No (class Sy Area )
Specify the size, in pixels, of the corner area; see the
.Fl area
option.
.It Sy delay No (class Sy Delay )
Specify the number of seconds to wait before running the program; see the
.Fl delay
option.
.It Sy position No (class Sy Position )
Set the position to one of: "nw", "ne", "sw", or "se"; see descriptions of the
.Fl nw ,
.Fl ne ,
.Fl sw ,
and
.Fl se
options.
.It Sy program No (class Sy Program )
Specify the full pathname of the program to run; see the
.Fl program
option.
.It Sy timeout No (class Sy Timeout )
Set the timeout to the specified number of seconds; see the
.Fl timeout
option.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
program resource class is
.Sy XIdle .
.Sh EXAMPLES
Run
.Xr xlock 1
using the flying bats mode if no activity is detected in 300 seconds or the
pointer sits in the southwest corner for more than 5 seconds:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ xidle -delay 5 -sw -program "/usr/X11R6/bin/xlock -mode bat" \e
	-timeout 300
.Ed
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr xlock 1 ,
.Xr XScreenSaver 3 ,
.Xr X 7
.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Nm
program was written by Federico Schwindt as an xautolock replacement.
.Sh BUGS
The maximum number of arguments for
.Fl program ,
including the executable file, is currently set to 9.
