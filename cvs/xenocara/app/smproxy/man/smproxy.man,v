.SH NAME
smproxy \- Session Manager Proxy
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B smproxy
[-clientId id] [-restore saveFile] [-version]
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 8
.B \-clientId \fIid\fP
Specifies the session ID used by \fIsmproxy\fP in the previous session.
.TP 8
.B \-restore \fIsaveFile\fP
Specifies the file used by \fIsmproxy\fP to save state in the previous session.
.TP 8
.B \-version
Prints the program version and exits.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fIsmproxy\fP allows X applications that do not support X11R6 session
management to participate in an X11R6 session.
.br
.sp
In order for \fIsmproxy\fP to act as a proxy for an X application, one of
the following must be true:
.br
.sp
- The application maps a top level window containing the
\fBWM_CLIENT_LEADER\fR property.  This property provides a pointer to
the client leader window which contains the \fBWM_CLASS\fR, \fBWM_NAME\fR,
\fBWM_COMMAND\fR, and \fBWM_CLIENT_MACHINE\fR properties.
.br
.sp
or ...
.br
.sp
- The application maps a top level window which does not contain the
\fBWM_CLIENT_LEADER\fR property.  However, this top level window
contains the \fBWM_CLASS\fR, \fBWM_NAME\fR, \fBWM_COMMAND\fR, and
\fBWM_CLIENT_MACHINE\fR properties.
.PP
An application that support the \fBWM_SAVE_YOURSELF\fR protocol will receive
a \fBWM_SAVE_YOURSELF\fR client message each time the session manager issues
a checkpoint or shutdown.  This allows the application to save state.  If
an application does not support the \fBWM_SAVE_YOURSELF\fR protocol, then
the proxy will provide enough information to the session manager to restart
the application (using \fBWM_COMMAND\fR), but no state will be restored.
