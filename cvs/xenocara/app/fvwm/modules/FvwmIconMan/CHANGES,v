@6/17/98		Version 1.3:
			Added case sensitive sorting: *sort: namewithcase
			Fixed bug where the manager window wouldn't get redrawn
				in some cases.
			

4/14/98		Version 1.2:
			Changed default color scheme to be black on grey.
			Various bugfixes
			Fixed bug where the selected window would be wrong
				after the manager got resorted.
			Changed sort option to accept either 'name' or 'id'

12/31/97	Version 1.1:
			When drawicons option is set to "always", always draw
				the miniicons, regardless of whether the
				windows are iconifed (from Neil Moore). A sad
				result of setting this is that there is no
				visual indication of which windows are
				iconified. Since that code is due for cleanup
				anyway, I'll handle that later.
			sort option now takes one of these values: name, id,
				or none.


7/16/97		Version 1.0:
			Force complete draw of manager window when it gets
				mapped.

6/9/97		Version 0.9.9a:
			Fixed bug which led to compile error.

6/7/97		Version 0.9.9:
			Fixed bug where manager window wouldn't get
				properly cleared when it became empty.
			Changed function lookup to use bsearch
			Added 'label <string>' function, to provide named
				labels to jump to with bif, bifn and jmp.
			Altered	get_current_man to always return the manager
				if there is only one.

4/19/97		Version 0.9.8:
			Changed hash table size to 257.
			Fixed bug where followfocus was ignored.
			Hopefully fixed bug where some buttons wouldn't get
				drawn when window shape changed.
			MiniIcons should work on mono displays.
			
3/9/97		Version 0.9.7a:
			maximum width changed from 1000 to screen width.

2/11/97		Version 0.9.7:
			When FvwmIconMan was started without a managergeometry
			string, it would have an "Internal Error."
			Added titlebutton option.
			Added raisededge and sunkedge button styles.
			Manager no longer unmaps when empty, drawing the
				titlebutton instead.
			Added builtin function "warp"

2/10/97		Version 0.9.6:
			Added call to XSync() after setting window shape,
				otherwise, will get blank regions on next
				redraw.

2/7/97		Version 0.9.5:
			Fixed bug which caused buttons to change size
				when switching pages under high load.

2/6/97		Version 0.9.4:
			Added new action functions: bif, bifn, jmp, ret, print
				so now you can have simple if statements
			Fixed bug which caused manager to appear in surprising
				places when moving from one page to another.

2/5/97		Version 0.9.3
			Fixed bug where if a window moves from one manager
				to another (which can happen while FvwmIconMan
				is receiving the window list from fvwm), it 
				can end up using the format string of the 
				wrong manager.
			Fixed bug where if a window's name changes and
				that causes it to be removed from manager,
				it core dumps.
			Fixed bug which could cause FvwmIconMan to deadlock.
			Fixed window gravity bug which would cause corrupted
				window contents for managers which grow upward
				or leftward.
			other minor bugs.

2/4/97		Version 0.9.2:
			Silly me, I forgot that realloc (NULL, ...) isn't
				portable.

2/3/97		Version 0.9.1:
			rewrote almost all of the X code.
			can have multiple columns now.
			use shape extension if configured to.
			added shape option.
			added ButtonGeometry option.
			renamed Geometry option to ManGeometry, which works
				in units of buttons, not pixels.
			junked the old actions and redid all that.

12/8/96         Version 0.9:
			added usewinlist option.
			possibly fixed a bug.

9/27/96		Version 0.8:
			added miniicons.
			should update windows less when page changes.

			grab pointer when in transient mode.

			made an Imakefile
			including a patch to fvwm's focus function
			many bug fixes
