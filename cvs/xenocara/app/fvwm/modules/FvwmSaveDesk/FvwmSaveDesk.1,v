.SH NAME
FvwmSaveDesk \- another FVWM desktop-layout saving module
.SH SYNOPSIS
FvwmSaveDesk is spawned by fvwm, so no command line invocation will work.

.SH DESCRIPTION
When called, this module will attempt to save your current desktop
layout as a definition of extra lines for the function InitFunction
into the file
.I .fvwm2desk
in your home directory. As explain in the other documation, this
function is called at startup of fvwm2.
You have to include this file in
.I .fvwmrc
after the definition of the Function Initfunction.
You can do this by using the module
.I FvwmM4
or 
.I FvwmCpp.

Your applications must supply certain hints to the X window system.
.I Emacs
and
.I Netscape
, for example, does not, so FvwmSaveDesk can't get any
information from it.  
 
Also, FvwmSaveDesk assumes that certain command line options are
globally accepted by applications, which may not be the case.

.SH SETUP USING FVWMM4 MODULE
The M4 Macro processor substitutes its macros even in the middle of a 
word. Because of that you may have problems with predefined macros
such as include or define. To avoid this the GNU M4 has an extra
option to prefix all builtins with 'm4_'. FvwmM4 can be called with
option -m4-prefix and then will provide the option -P to M4.
I personally use the FvwmM4 module this way.

fvwm2 -f "FvwmM4 -m4-prefix -m4opt -I$HOME $HOME/.fvwmrc"

Simply add the following line to the end of .fvwmrc:

m4_include(`.fvwm2desk') .

.SH SETUP USING FVWMCPP MODULE
With the FVWMCPP you may have the problem that the preprocessor
directives starts with the comment charakter '#' and will
complain about unknown directives, if you have comments in your .fvwmrc.

fvwm2 -f "FvwmCpp -C-I$HOME $HOME/.fvwmrc"

Simply add the following line to the end of .fvwmrc:

#include ".fvwm2desk"

.SH INVOCATION
FvwmSaveDesk can be invoked by adding it to a menu or binding it to a 
mouse button or keystoke in
the 
.I .fvwmrc
file.
Fvwm2 will search directory specified in the ModulePath
configuration option to locate FvwmSaveDesk.

To insert it to a menu, add the line

+	"Save Desktop" Module FvwmSaveDesk

to the menu definition.
I thing binding it to a mouse button is not very useful, but you can
do that, by adding for example this line.

Mouse 3		R	CS	Module FvwmSaveDesk

Than FvwmSaveDesk will be called if you hit the right mouse button
on the root window while holding the shift and control button down.

You can bind FvwmSaveDesk to a function key F10 for example you have
to insert the following line:

Key	F10	A	Module FvwmSaveDesk

I personally add it as a Button to the module FvwmButtons:

*FvwmButtons SaveDesc desk.xpm   Module FvwmSaveDesk
