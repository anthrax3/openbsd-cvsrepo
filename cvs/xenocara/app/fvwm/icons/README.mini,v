@Mini XPM icon package (for fvwm).
Version 1
Free (F) by Ludvig A. Norin 1995
emph@@ludd.luth.se


This package contains 14x14 pixel icons
for use with the FVWM 2.x distribution.
The icons might of course be used in just
about any other purpose you can think of,
but since FVWM is such a great wm, I
really suggest that you use them in it,
rather than putting them in your private
.JPG/.GIF pictures just for the fun of it.

The icons are small enough to give the
FVWM menus a spiffy outlook. The icons
are optimized to use as few colors as
possible, and they will totally occypy
14 entrys of the colormap.

These files are included with this package:

mini.audiovol.xpm - For audiocontrol programs
mini.destroy.xpm  - For the 'destroy' command
mini.excl.xpm     - I use this in the 'Exit fvwm ->'
                    menu entry.
mini.exit.xpm     - For the 'close' command
mini.fvwm.xpm     - For the FVWM modules
mini.lower.xpm    - For the 'lower' command
mini.move.xpm     - For the 'move' command
mini.netscape.xpm - For Netscape Navigator (poor)
mini.raise.xpm    - For the 'raise' command
mini.resize.xpm   - For the 'resize' command
mini.xarchie.xpm  - For the Xarchie application (poor) 
mini.xboing.xpm   - For the Xboing game (poor)
mini.xlock.xpm    - For XLock
mini.xpm          - 14x14 pixels XPM template
mini.zircon.xpm   - For the Zircon application
README            - You guess!

I am right now too busy to create any more icons,
although I would like to have icons for several
applications. If you (YOU!) feel like being artistic,
you can view the icons with a plain text editor to
find out how the XPM format works, and then use the
template to create your own. You might then uuencode
them and mail them to me, and I will include them in
this package. (If I like them). Note that it's important
to use as few colors as possible, and prefferably those
that are already used in the other icons. Personally,
I feel it importand to keep the size down to 14x14, even
though the x axis (the width) migh be extended if 
required (like in mini.exit.xpm).

It would be nice to have icons for, among others, these
applications/functions:

(De)Iconify
Refresh Screen
Xv (A picture viewer)
Knews (a news reader for X)
MirrorMagic (a game)
Emacs (Great invention.)
Xterm


Hope you like'em;
Sincerly,
Ludvig A. Norin
