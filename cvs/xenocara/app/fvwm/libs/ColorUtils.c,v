@/*
 * The following GPL code from scwm  implements a good, fast 3D-shadowing
 * algorithm. It   converts  the color  from  RGB   to  HLS  space,  then
 * multiplies both the  luminosity   and the saturation by  a   specified
 * factor (clipping at the  extremes). Then it  converts back to  RGB and
 * creates a color. The guts of it, i.e.  the `color_mult' routine, looks
 * a bit longish, but this  is only because  there are 6-way conditionals
 * at the begining and end; it actually runs quite fast. The algorithm is
 * the same  as Gtk's,  but  the  implemenation  is independent and  more
 * streamlined.
 *
 * Calling `adjust_pixel_brightness' with  a `factor' of 1.3 for hilights
 * and 0.7 for  shadows exactly emulates  Gtk's shadowing, which is,  IMO
 * the most visually pleasing shadowing of any widget  set; using 1.2 and
 * 0.5  respectively gives something closer to  the "classic" fvwm effect
 * with deeper shadows and more subtle hilights, but still (IMO) smoother
 * and more attractive than fvwm.
 *
 * The only color these  routines do not  usefully handle is black; black
 * will be returned even  for a factor  greater than 1.0, when  optimally
 * one  would like  to  see a  very dark  gray.  This could   possibly be
 * addressed by  adding   a  small   additive factor  when    brightening
 * colors. If anyone adds that feature, please feed it upstream to me.
 *
 * Feel free to use this code in fvwm2, of course.
 *
 * - Maciej Stachowiak
 *
 * And, of course, history shows, we took him up on the offer.
 * Integrated into fvwm2 by Dan Espen, 11/13/98.

 *
 * The  input  pixel,   is normally  the  background   color used in  the

 * with a multi-color pixmap, they will have the insight to also assign a
 * background color to the pixmaped  area  that approximates the  average

 *
 * Currently callers handle monochrome before calling  this routine.  The

 * a  new   API   that  deals   with  foreground/background/hilite/shadow
 * allocation all in 1 call is the next logical extenstion.
 *
 * Color  allocation  is also a  good   candidate for becoming  a library
 * routine.  The color   allocation  logic in FvwmButtons using   the XPM
 * library closeness stuff may be the ideal model.
