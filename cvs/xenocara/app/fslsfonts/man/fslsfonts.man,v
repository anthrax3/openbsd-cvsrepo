.TH FSLSFONTS 1 __xorgversion__
.SH NAME
fslsfonts \- list fonts served by X font server
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B fslsfonts
[\-options ...] [\-fn pattern]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I fslsfonts
lists the fonts that match the given \fIpattern\fP.
The wildcard character "*" may be used to match any sequence of
characters (including none), and "?" to match any single character.
If no pattern is given, "*" is assumed.
.PP
The "*" and "?" characters must be quoted to prevent them from
being expanded by the shell.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
.TP 8
.B \-server \fIservername\fP
This option specifies the X font server to contact.
.I servername
must be specified in one of the formats defined in the
.I Font Server Names
section of X(__miscmansuffix__).   If not specified, the server name in the
.B FONTSERVER
environment variable is used.
.PP
.TP 8
.B \-l
Lists some attributes of the font on one line in addition to its name.
.TP 8
.B \-ll
Lists font properties in addition to \fB\-l\fP output.
.TP 8
.B \-lll
Supported for compatibility with \fIxlsfonts\fP, but output is the
same as for \fB\-ll\fP.
.TP 8
.B \-m
This option indicates that long listings should also print the minimum and
maximum bounds of each font.
.TP 8
.B \-C
This option indicates that listings should use multiple columns.  This is the
same as \fB\-n 0\fP.
.TP 8
.B \-1
This option indicates that listings should use a single column.  This is the
same as \fB\-n 1\fP.
.TP 8
.B \-w \fIwidth\fP
This option specifies the width in characters that should be used in
figuring out how many columns to print.  The default is 79.
.TP 8
.B \-n \fIcolumns\fP
This option specifies the number of columns to use in displaying the output.
The default is 0, which
will attempt to fit as many columns of font names into the
number of character specified by \fB\-w\fP \fIwidth\fP.
.TP 8
.B \-u
This option indicates that the output should be left unsorted.
.TP 8
.B \-version
This option prints the program version and exits.
.PP
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP 8
.B FONTSERVER
To get the default fontserver.  The server name must
be specified in one of the formats defined in the
.I Font Server Names
section of X(__miscmansuffix__).
.SH "SEE ALSO"
xfs(__appmansuffix__), showfont(__appmansuffix__), xlsfonts(__appmansuffix__),
X(__miscmansuffix__).
.SH BUGS
Doing ``fslsfonts \-l'' can tie up your server for a very long time.
This is really a bug with single-threaded non-preemptable servers, not with
this program.
