.Sh NAME
.Nm video
.Nd record or display images from
.Xr video 4
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Bk -words
.Op Fl \&gqRv
.Op Fl a Ar adaptor
.Op Fl e Ar encoding
.Op Fl f Ar file
.Op Fl i Ar input
.Op Fl O Ar output
.Op Fl o Ar output
.Op Fl r Ar rate
.Op Fl s Ar size
.Ek
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a utility for reading, writing and displaying streams of raw video frames.
By default frames are read from
.Ar file
and displayed via
.Xr Xv 3 .
The default
.Ar file
is
.Pa /dev/video .
If the
.Fl o
option is used frames are read from
.Ar file
and written to
.Ar output .
If the
.Fl i
option is used frames are read from
.Ar input
and displayed via
.Xr Xv 3 .
If the
.Fl O
option is used frames are read from
.Ar file ,
written to
.Ar output
and displayed via
.Xr Xv 3 .
The acutance, brightness, contrast, gain, gamma, hue and saturation
controls of
.Ar file
can also be adjusted if
.Ar file
supports these controls.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width "-a adaptor"
.It Fl a Ar adaptor
Index of
.Xr Xv 3
adaptor to use.
The default is 0, the first adaptor reported by
.Xr X 7 .
.It Fl e Ar encoding
Lowercase FOURCC name of video encoding to use.
Valid arguments are
.Ql uyvy
and
.Ql yuy2 .
The default is
.Ql yuy2
unless
.Ar file
is being used and only supports
.Ql uyvy ,
in which case
.Ql uyvy
will be used by default.
.It Fl f Ar file
.Xr video 4
device from which frames will be read.
The default is
.Pa /dev/video .
.It Fl g
Use
.Xr read 2
to grab frames instead of
.Xr mmap 2 .
.It Fl i Ar input
File from which frames will be read.
If
.Ar input
is
.Ql - ,
frames will be read from standard input.
.It Fl O Ar output
File to which frames will be written.
If
.Ar output
is
.Ql - ,
frames will be written to standard output.
In contrast to
.Fl o ,
if this option is used,
.Nm
will also display the frames via
.Xr Xv 3 .
.It Fl o Ar output
File to which frames will be written.
If
.Ar output
is
.Ql - ,
frames will be written to standard output.
.It Fl q
Query for encodings, frame sizes/rates, and controls.
Display them and quit.
.It Fl R
Disable frame rate adjustment.
.It Fl r Ar rate
Rate in frames per second at which to read.
Must be an integer greater than 0.
If the
.Fl r
option is not specified, frames will be read as quickly as possible.
If reading from a
.Xr video 4
device, the device's frame rate will be set to the frame rate the device
supports that is closest to
.Ar rate .
Frames will be read as quickly as they are available from the device, but
will be displayed and/or written to
.Ar output
at the rate specified, unless the
.Fl R
option is used.
.It Fl s Ar size
Size of frames to read.
The format of
.Ar size
is WxH, where W represents width and H represents height, both expressed
as number of pixels.
The default is 640x480.
If
.Ar size
does not contain
.Ql x ,
.Ar size
is interpreted as only the width.
If
.Ql x
is the first character of
.Ar size ,
the characters following
.Ql x
are interpreted as the height.
If only one of width or height is specified, the other will be calculated
using a 4:3 width:height ratio.
For example, if given
.Ql -s 640
.Nm
will use a size of
.Ql 640x480 .
When reading from a
.Xr video 4
device and displaying the frames on an
.Xr Xv 3
display, this option also accepts two special strings,
.Ql half
and
.Ql full.
If either
.Ql half
or
.Ql full
are specified,
.Nm
will read frames that are no larger than 2/3 the display width and
2/3 the display height.
If
.Ql full
is specified,
.Nm
will stretch the frame to the full size of the display using
.Xr Xv 3
scaling.
If
.Nm
is reading frames from a
.Xr video 4
device and the frame size does not match a frame size the device supports,
.Nm
will use the largest frame size supported by the device that is smaller
than the specified size.
.It Fl v
Verbose mode.
Multiple instances of this option are allowed.
Each instance increases the level of informational output printed to
.Ar stderr .
.El
.Pp
.Nm
will quit reading frames and exit nicely if it receives any of
the following signals: SIGHUP, SIGINT, SIGKILL, SIGTERM, SIGPIPE.
.Pp
.Nm
responds to certain key presses while it is displaying frames.
The keypresses are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width "aXX"
.It Ic A
Increase acutance (sharpness) control of
.Ar file .
.It Ic a
Decrease acutance (sharpness) control of
.Ar file .
.It Ic B
Increase brightness control of
.Ar file .
.It Ic b
Decrease brightness control of
.Ar file .
.It Ic C
Increase contrast control of
.Ar file .
.It Ic c
Decrease contrast control of
.Ar file .
.It Ic f
Toggle full-screen display.
.It Ic G
Increase gain control of
.Ar file .
.It Ic g
Decrease gain control of
.Ar file .
.It Ic H
Increase hue control of
.Ar file .
.It Ic h
Decrease hue control of
.Ar file .
.It Ic M
Increase gamma control of
.Ar file .
.It Ic m
Decrease gamma control of
.Ar file .
.It Ic O
Start writing to
.Ar output .
Only meaningful when the
.Fl O
option is used.
.It Ic o
Stop writing to
.Ar output .
Only meaningful when the
.Fl O
option is used.
.It Ic p
Toggle new frame display.
.It Ic q
Quit
.Nm .
.It Ic r
Reset all supported controls of
.Ar file
to their default value.
.It Ic S
Increase saturation control of
.Ar file .
.It Ic s
Decrease saturation control of
.Ar file .
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following command will read YUY2 encoded, 640 pixel wide and 480 pixel
high video frames from
.Ar /dev/video
and display them using the default
.Xr Xv 3
adaptor:
.Pp
.Dl "$ video"
.Pp
The following command will read YUY2 encoded, 640 pixel wide and 480 pixel
high video frames from
.Ar /dev/video
and write them to
.Ar video.raw
at a rate of 15 frames per second:
.Pp
.Dl "$ video -r 15 -o video.raw"
.Pp
The following command will read YUY2 encoded, 640 pixel wide and 480 pixel
high video frames from
.Ar /dev/video ,
write them to
.Ar video.raw
and display them using the default
.Xr Xv 3
adaptor at a rate of 15 frames per second:
.Pp
.Dl "$ video -r 15 -O video.raw"
.Pp
The following command will read YUY2 encoded, 640 pixel wide and 480 pixel
high video frames from
.Ar video.raw
and display them on the default
.Xr Xv 3
adaptor at a rate of 15 frames per second:
.Pp
.Dl "$ video -r 15 -i video.raw"
.Pp
Note that with the first three commands, if
.Ar /dev/video
does not support 640x480 pixels sized frames, the largest frame size
smaller than 640x480 will be used, and if
.Ar /dev/video
does not support yuy2 encoding, uyvy will be used.

* add new option -R which dsables frame rate adjustment.  only really
useful for video(4) devices, to see the difference between the frame
rate the device generates and what it says it's configured for ...
many devices don't generate the rate they are configured if they
aren't getting enough light ...
* poll(2) input with INFTIM instead of 0 timeout, and handle the poll(2)
call being interrupted by the frame timer.
* only use usleep(3) to wait for frames if the input is a file, and
in that case, sleep for a full frame interval or until interrupted
by the frame timer.
* update the manual to describe the new -R option, that -r now sets
video(4) frame rate, and that at least one -v will display supported
properties of the hardware.
