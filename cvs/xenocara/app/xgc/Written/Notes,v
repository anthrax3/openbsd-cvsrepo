ClearArea
---------
Basically a special case of PolyFillRect.  Put up some sort of image first
so we can clear it away.  Try both small areas and big areas, to give
credit to servers for optimizing small ones.

Data: Pixels per second.
      Breaking that down into large and small areas would probably not
        be userful.
      
GC Fields: None.


CopyArea
--------
Putting up some image and then repeatedly copying from one part of it
to another would do the right thing and could look neat if done right.

We probably want to see what happens when the source area is clipped,
as that as mentioned specifically in the protocol document.

Data: Pixels per second.
      
GC Fields: function             (*)
           plane-mask
	   subwindow-mode
	   graphics-exposures
	   clip-x-origin
	   clip-y-origin
	   clip-mask


CopyPlane
---------
Special case of CopyArea again.


PolyPoint
---------
Draw lots of points.
Either start out with an image that's 50/50 black and white
(preferred) or draw enough points that some points will get drawn at
least twice (to test functions other than copy).

Data: Points per second.

GC fields: function             (*)
           plane-mask
           foreground
           subwindow-mode
           clip-x-origin
           clip-y-origin
	   clip-mask


PolyLine
--------
Circular test like there is now.
Try clipping at window boundaries?

Data: Lines per second.
      Pixels per second (is this valid - do lines that are twice as
        long take twice as long to draw? Also, is it valid to compare
        thin lines and fat lines?)
 
GC fields: function             (*)
           plane-mask
           line-width           (*)
           line-style		(*)

           clip-x-origin
           clip-y-origin

Possibly   foreground

           tile			(*)

           tile-stipple-x-origin
	   tile-stipple-y-origin
	   dash-offset
	   dashes		(*)


PolySegment
-----------
Just like PolyLine but lines don't have to be connected. Crosshatching?

Data: Lines per second, pixels per second(?)

GC fields: function
	plane-mask
	line-width
	line-style
	cap-style
	fill-style
	subwindow-mode
	clip-x-origin
	clip-y-origin
	clip-mask
Possibly  foreground
	background
	tile
	stipple
	tile-stipple-x-origin
	tile-stipple-y-origin
	dash-offset
	dashes


PolyRectangle
-------------
Lots of five point PolyLines.  Partly concentric ones would look nice; we
also need overlap for testing different functions.

Data: Rectangles per second.
	Pixels per second? (divide by perimeter)

GC fields: function
	plane-mask
	line-width
	line-style
	join-style
	fill-style
	subwindow-mode
	clip-x-origin
	clip-y-origin
	clip-mask
Possibly foreground
	background
	tile
	stipple
	tile-stipple-x-origin
	tile-stipple-y-origin
	dash-offset
	dashes


PolyArc
-------
Overlapping concentric things (ripples) would look cool.
Is it possible to special-case circles?  Test for this?

Data: Arcs per second?  If we had the same test each time this might
        be OK.
      Pixels per second?  Finding the length of an arc could be
        annoying.

GC fields: function
	plane-mask
	line-width
	line-style
	cap-style
	join-style
	fill-style
	subwindow-mode
	clip-x-origin
	clip-y-origin
	clip-mask
Possibly foreground
	background
	tile
	stipple
	tile-stipple-x-origin
	tile-stipple-y-origin
	dash-offset
	dashes


FillPoly
--------
Use the same test as PolyLine?
Overlapping is a must to test functions.
Convex vs. Concave polygons.

Data: Pixels per second, I guess.
      Data for convex vs. concave could be interesting.

GC fields: function
	plane-mask
	fill-style
	fill-rule
	subwindow-mode
	clip-x-origin
	clip-y-origin
	clip-mask
Possibly foreground
	background
	tile
	stipple
	tile-stipple-x-origin
	tile-stipple-y-origin


PolyFillRectangle
-----------------
Use same test as PolyRectangle?
Perhaps give FillPoly some of these too, see if it special cases them.
Fill Rectangle vs. Fill Poly for same size areas would be an
  interesting comparison.

Data: Pixels per second.

GC fields: function
	plane-mask
	fill-style
	subwindow-mode
	clip-x-origin
	clip-y-origin
	clip-mask
Possibly foreground
	background
	tile
	stipple
	tile-stipple-x-origin
	tile-stipple-y-origin


PolyFillArc
-----------
Use same test as PolyArc?

Data: Pixels per second would be hard to compute, but what else is there?

GC fields: function
	plane-mask
	fill-style
	arc-mode
	subwindow-mode
	clip-x-origin
	clip-y-origin
	clip-mask
Possibly foreground
	background
	tile
	stipple
	tile-stipple-x-origin
	tile-stipple-y-origin


PutImage
--------

GC fields: function
	plane-mask
	subwindow-mode
	clip-x-origin
	clip-y-origin
	clip-mask
Possibly foreground
	background


GetImage
--------

PolyText8
---------

GC fields: function
	plane-mask
	fill-style
	font
	subwindow-mode
	clip-x-origin
	clip-y-origin
	clip-mask
Possibly foreground
	background
	tile
	stipple
	tile-stipple-x-origin
	tile-stipple-y-origin


PolyText16
----------

ImageText8
----------

GC fields: plane-mask
	foreground
	background
	font
	subwindow-mode
	clip-x-origin
	clip-y-origin
	clip-mask
