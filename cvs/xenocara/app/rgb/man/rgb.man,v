.SH NAME
rgb \- build the color name database
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B rgb
[
.I dbname
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B rgb
reads from standard input lines of the form:
.PP
.nf
.I
	red\ \ green\ \ blue\ \ \ \ \ \ name
.fi
.PP
where
.I red
/
.I green
/
.I blue
are decimal values between the range 0 to 255, and
.I name
is a description of the color.
.B rgb
then builds a color name database in
.B __RGB_DB_TYPE__
format.  The color name database provides a mapping between ASCII color
names and RGB color values.  It is useful for increasing the
portability of color programs.  The input source for the database is
in \fI__RGB_DB__.txt\fP.  \fIrgb.txt\fP
is compiled into the __RGB_DB_TYPE__ files
.IR "__RGB_DB_FILES__" .
When the server first starts up, it consults the contents of these
files to build an internal representation of their contents.  This
internal representation is consulted to map color names to color
values.
.PP
.B rgb
uses the default color name database of \fI__RGB_DB__.txt\fP.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "\fIdbname" 1i
Color name database.
.SH EXAMPLES
example% rgb rgb < __RGB_DB__.txt
.PP

.SH FILES
