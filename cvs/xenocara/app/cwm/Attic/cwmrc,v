log
@Replace the symlink configuration scheme with a simple yacc parser as
found in other places of the tree.  Remove sticky and font commandline
options and add another one for alternative config locations.
Split off cwmrc(5) from cwm(1), nuke #ifdef __OpenBSD__ while there.

tested by various kind people, feedback from oga@@ and okan@@ - thanks!
