 * The original code for this mode was written by Mark J. Kilgard

 *
 * Porting it to xlock  was possible by comparing the original Mesa's morph3d
 * demo with it's ported version to xlock, so thanks for Marcelo F. Vianna
 * (look at morph3d.c) for his indirect help.
 *
 * Thanks goes also to Brian Paul for making it possible and inexpensive
 * to use OpenGL at home.
