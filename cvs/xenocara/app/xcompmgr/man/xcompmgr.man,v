.SH NAME
xcompmgr \- sample X compositing manager
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BI "xcompmgr [\-d " display "] [\-r " radius "]"
.BI "[\-o " opacity "] [\-l " left-offset "]"
.BI "[\-t " top-offset "] [\-acCfFnsS]"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B xcompmgr
is a sample compositing manager for X servers supporting the XFIXES, DAMAGE,
and COMPOSITE extensions.  It enables basic eye-candy effects.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI \-d\  display
Specifies the display to manage.
.TP
.BI \-r\  radius
Specifies the blur radius for client-side shadows.
.TP
.BI \-o\  opacity
Specifies the opacity for client-side shadows.
.TP
.BI \-l\  left-offset
Specifies the left offset for client-side shadows.
.TP
.BI \-t\  top-offset
Specifies the top offset for client-side shadows.
.TP
.BI \-I\  fade-in-step
Specifies the opacity change between steps while fading in.
.TP
.BI \-O\  fade-out-step
Specifies the opacity change between steps while fading out.
.TP
.BI \-D\  fade-delta
Specifies the time (in milliseconds) between steps in a fade.
.TP
.BI \-a
Automatic server-side compositing.  This instructs the server to use the
standard composition rules.  Useful for debugging.
.TP
.BI \-c
Client-side compositing with soft shadows and translucency support.
.TP
.BI \-f
When \-c is specified, enables a smooth fade effect for transient windows like
menus, and for all windows on hide and restore events.
.TP
.BI \-n
Simple client-side compositing. This is the default mode.
.TP
.BI \-s
Server-side compositing with hard-edged shadows.
.TP
.BI \-C
When \-c is specified, attempts to avoid painting shadows on panels and docks.
.TP
.BI \-F
When \-f is specified, also enables the fade effect when windows change their
opacity, as with transset(1).
.TP
.BI \-S
Enables synchronous operation.  Useful for debugging.
.SH BUGS
Probably.  Please report any you find to http://bugs.freedesktop.org/.
