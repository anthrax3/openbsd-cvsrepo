@Update to xterm 287. tested by mpi@@ and krw@@.

text
@================================================================================
You installed xterm with wide chars support. This introduces some limitations
comparing to the plain single chars version: this version of xterm will use
UTF-8 charset for selection buffers, breaking 8-bit copy/paste support unless
you are using UTF-8 or ISO8859-1 locale. If you want 8-bit charset selections to
work as before, use "eightBitSelectTypes" XTerm resource setting.

For further information refer to the SELECT/PASTE section of xterm(1) manual
page.
