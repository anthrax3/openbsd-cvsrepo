/*
 * This module provides test support for curses applications that must work
 * with terminals that have the xmc (magic cookie) glitch.  The xmc_glitch
 * resource denotes the number of spaces that are emitted when switching to or
 * from standout (reverse) mode.  Some terminals implement this by storing the
 * attribute controls in the character cell that is skipped.  So if the cell is
 * overwritten by text, then the attribute change in the cell is cancelled,
 * causing attributes to the left of the change to propagate.
 *
 * We implement the glitch by writing a character that won't be mistaken for
 * other normal characters (and mapping normal writes to that character to a
 * different one).
 *
 * Since xmc isn't normally part of xterm, we document it here rather than in
 * the man-page.  This module is driven by resources rather than by the
 * termcap/terminfo description to make it a little more flexible for testing
 * purposes.
 *
 * Resources:
 *
 * xmcGlitch (class XmcGlitch)
 *	When true, enables this extension.  The default is `0', which disables
 *	the module.  (termcap sg, terminfo xmc).
 *
 * xmcAttributes (class XmcAttributes)
 *	The attributes for which we'll generate a glitch, as a bitmask.
 *
 *		INVERSE		1
 *		UNDERLINE	2
 *		BOLD		4
 *		BLINK		8
 *
 *	The default is `1' (INVERSE).  Some terminals emit glitches for
 *	underline.  Just for completeness, we recognize all of the video
 *	attributes.
 *
 * xmcInline (class XmcInline)
 *	When true, limits the extent of an SGR change to the current line.
 *	The default is `false'.  (No termcap or terminfo equivalent, though
 *	there are comments in some entries relating to this issue).
 *
 * xmcMoveSGR (class XmcMoveSGR)
 *	When false, a cursor movement will leave a glitch when SGR's are
 *	active.  The default is `true'.  (termcap ms, terminfo msgr).
 *
 * TODO:
 *	When xmc is active, the terminfo max_attributes (ma) capability is
 *	assumed to be 1.
 *
 *	The xmcAttributes resource should also apply to alternate character
 *	sets and to color.
