@Update to xauth 1.0.10
@

    I. OVERVIEW

The xauth program is used to edit and display the authorization
information used in connecting to the X server.
The underlying "Authorization Protocol for X" is described in the
README file of the libXau module of X11.

    II. BUILDING

Use "./autogen.sh" to configure the package and "make" to compile it.
A black box check for the correctness of the package can be initiated
by "make check" (make sure to install "cmdtest" from
http://liw.fi/cmdtest/). The installation is done by "make install".

   III. COMMUNICATION

All questions regarding this software should be directed at the
Xorg mailing list:

        http://lists.freedesktop.org/mailman/listinfo/xorg

Please submit bug reports to the Xorg bugzilla:

        https://bugs.freedesktop.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=xorg

The master development code repository can be found at:

        git://anongit.freedesktop.org/git/xorg/app/xauth

        http://cgit.freedesktop.org/xorg/app/xauth

For patch submission instructions, see:

	http://www.x.org/wiki/Development/Documentation/SubmittingPatches

For more information on the git code manager, see:

        http://wiki.x.org/wiki/GitPage


   IV. RELEASING

This section describes how to release a new version of xauth to the
public. A detailed description of this process can be found at
http://www.x.org/wiki/Development/Documentation/ReleaseHOWTO with a
few clarification below.

Remember, that the last commit _must_ include the version string in
its diff (not the commit message). This is typically done by
incrementing the version string in configure.ac.

For releasing under Fedora make sure, that
/usr/share/util-macros/INSTALL exists. If not, then please create that
file.

To release a new version of xauth, please follow this steps:

 * git clone ssh://git.freedesktop.org/git/xorg/app/xauth
 * cd xauth ; ./autogen.sh ; make ; make check
 * follow ReleaseHowto inside this directory.

Ignore these errors shown during release.sh:

   /bin/sh: ../.changelog.tmp: Permission denied
   git directory not found: installing possibly empty changelog.

   cp: cannot create regular file '../.INSTALL.tmp': Permission denied
   util-macros "pkgdatadir" from xorg-macros.pc not found: installing possibly empty INSTALL.

   V. GARBAGE

Please ignore this paragraph. It is only used to satisfying
release.sh, which wants to see the version number to the last version
in the diff, which is 1.0.9 in our case.  This paragraph can be
deleted on the next release of xauth.
