@Remove fastercsv.  This became the official ruby csv library starting in
ruby 1.9.

OK sthen@@
@
text
@FasterCSV is intended as a replacement to Ruby's standard CSV
library. It was designed to address concerns users of that library
had and it has three primary goals:

1. Be significantly faster than CSV while remaining a pure Ruby
   library.
2. Use a smaller and easier to maintain code base.  (FasterCSV is
   larger now, but considerably richer in features.  The parsing
   core remains quite small.)
3. Improve on the CSV interface.
