@- more gtk1/gnome1 stuff to go

discussed with and ok ajacoutot@@ landry@@

@The configure script never actually checks for string.h so the
macro tested in ifdef is never defined. Other source files in
this software unconditionally include string.h so this patch
follows suit.

A more correct fix would be to adjust the autoconf input file
(configure.in) to check for string.h, and wrap the #include in
ifdef for the other 19 source files. The expedient option was
chosen since this software is long out of maintenance and
the patches would make no difference to building on OpenBSD.

@Patch to #include more headers to fix missing prototypes, which
resulted in pointer truncation on LP64 arch.

patch-debugXML_c - string.h is wrapped in #ifdef, but the macro is
never set by autoconf. Most other source here unconditionally includes
string.h, so follow suit - fgsch@@ would prefer mending configure.in.
Explanatory notes added to patch. ok martynas@@.

patch-xmlmemory_h - stdlib.h missing. ok fgsch@@ martynas@@.
