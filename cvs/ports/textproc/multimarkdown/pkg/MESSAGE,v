@If you want to use either the memoir or beamer LaTeX classes
with multimarkdown it is recommended you grab the author's
LaTeX support files:

https://github.com/fletcher/peg-multimarkdown-latex-support

They are usually installed under your ~/texmf directory, e.g.
~/texmf/tex/latex/mmd.

MultiMarkdown is a derivative of Markdown that adds new syntax
features, such as footnotes, tables, and metadata. Additionally, it
offers mechanisms to convert plain text into LaTeX in addition to
HTML.
