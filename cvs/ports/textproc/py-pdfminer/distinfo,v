@Import PDFMiner 20140328

PDFMiner is a tool for extracting information from PDF documents. Unlike other
PDF-related tools, it focuses entirely on getting and analyzing text data.
PDFMiner allows one to obtain the exact location of text in a page, as well as
other information such as fonts or lines. It includes a PDF converter that can
transform PDF files into other text formats (such as HTML). It has an
extensible PDF parser that can be used for other purposes than text analysis.
