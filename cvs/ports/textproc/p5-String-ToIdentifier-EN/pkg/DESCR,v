@This module provides a utility method, "to_identifier" for converting
an arbitrary string into a readable representation using the ASCII
subset of "\w" for use as an identifier in a computer program. The
intent is to make unique identifier names from which the content
of the original string can be easily inferred by a human just by
reading the identifier.

If you need the full set of "\w" including Unicode, see the subclass
String::ToIdentifier::EN::Unicode.

Currently, this process is one way only, and will likely remain
this way.

The default is to create camelCase identifiers, or you may pass in
a separator char of your choice such as "_".

Binary char groups will be separated by "_" even in camelCase
identifiers to make them easier to read, e.g.: "foo_2_0xFF_Bar".
