@update to MuPDF-1.8
- many fixes and improvements to EPUB support
- mudraw moves to the multi-purpose mutool binary
- add new OpenGL-based viewer, mupdf-gl
- add an optional flavour to enable the javascript support (wasn't
on by default before in our package, and still isn't)

@MuPDF is a lightweight PDF and XPS viewer.

The renderer in MuPDF is tailored for high quality anti-aliased
graphics. It renders text with metrics and spacing accurate to within
fractions of a pixel for the highest fidelity in reproducing the look of
a printed page on screen.

MuPDF is also small, fast, and yet complete. It supports PDF 1.7 with
transparency, encryption, hyperlinks, annotations, searching and more.
It also reads OpenXPS documents.

We don't support interactive features such as form filling, javascript
and transitions. MuPDF is written modularly, so such features can be
added on by integrators if they so desire.

The mutool command line tool supports multiple arguments, including
"show" to print and examine objects in a PDF file, "clean" to decompress
and pretty-print the streams and objects in PDF files and also to
extract individual pages, "info" to display information about objects,
"extract" to extract individual objects, and "poster" to split a large
page into many tiles.

The mudraw command line tool renders pages and outputs PGM/PPM/PAM/PNG
image files.

Flavors:
	js - build with JavaScript support (using the MuJS interpreter)

@update to MuPDF 0.8.165, now also supporting XPS documents.

- drop fontres.c and switch to upstream's standard method of embedding fonts;
with gcc4 this is now able to build on arm without running out of RAM (this is
fortunate because it avoids reworking fontres for changes to MuPDF).

MuPDF has a small footprint.  A binary that includes the standard Roman
fonts is only one megabyte.  A build with full CJK support (including an
Asian font) is approximately five megabytes.

@- update MuPDF to 0.6. (various improvements including copying text
from PDFs with the ight mouse button. no search yet though).
note that the command-line options have changed slightly and there
are new keybindings - see mupdf(1).

- only pdfinfo conflicts with other packages, so switch to the
standard names for the other tools

- install the new manpages from upstream (replacing our mupdf manpage),
library, headers, .pc and desktop integration files

thanks ajacoutot@@ for checking and improvements for the desktop
integration files, and Roberto Fernandez for looking over the
fontres parts.

Fitz is a project to create a new and modern graphics library.
At the core of Fitz is the display tree: a scene graph of vector
graphics, images and text making up the contents of a page.
d3 18
a20 22
The standard components of Fitz are:

    * Base runtime (thin memory and error handling layer)
    * Streams and filters (standard postscript, pdf and tiff filters)
    * World model (display trees and resources)
    * Drawing (draw the tree to a bitmap raster) 

MuPDF is a PDF parser that reads PDF files and creates Fitz trees.

MuPDF also has an API to modify internal objects in the PDF files
and write PDF files. For instance, it is possible to use the MuPDF
library to encrypt existing PDF files, or to rearrange the pages.

pdftool is a commandline demo of this functionality; it is a portable
pdf swiss army knife for fixing broken pdf files, changing permissions,
merging and extracting pages, and examining the internal object
structure of a PDF file.

The mupdf binary (aka pdfview) is a bare bones PDF viewer. 

The optional no_cjk flavor disables CJK font metrics, giving a
smaller binary.
