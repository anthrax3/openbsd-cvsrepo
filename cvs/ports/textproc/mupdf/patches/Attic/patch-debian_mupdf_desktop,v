@Update to MuPDF 1.3, and enable cURL support (separate binary, not subpackaged
here as cURL is a fairly common package).

Earlier version without cURL support ok rpe@@, additional tests on various
arch from brett@@, Florian Stinglmayr and Donovan Watteau (who also reminded
me about a change of name for mubusy needed in DESCR).

log
@update mupdf (a nice fast lightweight pdf viewer with its own codebase
rather than yet-another-xpdf-derivative) to 0.8.15.

various improvements and fixes, notably now supports AESv3 encrypted
PDFs and, very welcome, search now operates over all pages and is thus
actually useful.

log
@update mupdf to 0.7

Note: key bindings changed slightly; notably /=search (currently
only within a page), n=next search hit, N=last search hit.
A few others were removed to make room and consistency. See
manpage for more (or hit ? while running and look at stdout).

1.1
log
@- update MuPDF to 0.6. (various improvements including copying text
from PDFs with the ight mouse button. no search yet though).
note that the command-line options have changed slightly and there
are new keybindings - see mupdf(1).

- only pdfinfo conflicts with other packages, so switch to the
standard names for the other tools

- install the new manpages from upstream (replacing our mupdf manpage),
library, headers, .pc and desktop integration files

thanks ajacoutot@@ for checking and improvements for the desktop
integration files, and Roberto Fernandez for looking over the
fontres parts.
