@update mupdf to 0.7

Note: key bindings changed slightly; notably /=search (currently
only within a page), n=next search hit, N=last search hit.
A few others were removed to make room and consistency. See
manpage for more (or hit ? while running and look at stdout).

@- update MuPDF to 0.6. (various improvements including copying text
from PDFs with the ight mouse button. no search yet though).
note that the command-line options have changed slightly and there
are new keybindings - see mupdf(1).

- only pdfinfo conflicts with other packages, so switch to the
standard names for the other tools

- install the new manpages from upstream (replacing our mupdf manpage),
library, headers, .pc and desktop integration files

thanks ajacoutot@@ for checking and improvements for the desktop
integration files, and Roberto Fernandez for looking over the
fontres parts.
