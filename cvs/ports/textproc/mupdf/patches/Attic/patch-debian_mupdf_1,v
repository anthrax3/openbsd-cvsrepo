@update mupdf (a nice fast lightweight pdf viewer with its own codebase
rather than yet-another-xpdf-derivative) to 0.8.15.

various improvements and fixes, notably now supports AESv3 encrypted
PDFs and, very welcome, search now operates over all pages and is thus
actually useful.

log
@update mupdf to 0.7

Note: key bindings changed slightly; notably /=search (currently
only within a page), n=next search hit, N=last search hit.
A few others were removed to make room and consistency. See
manpage for more (or hit ? while running and look at stdout).
