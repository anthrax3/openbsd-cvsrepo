@- update MuPDF to 0.6. (various improvements including copying text
from PDFs with the ight mouse button. no search yet though).
note that the command-line options have changed slightly and there
are new keybindings - see mupdf(1).

- only pdfinfo conflicts with other packages, so switch to the
standard names for the other tools

- install the new manpages from upstream (replacing our mupdf manpage),
library, headers, .pc and desktop integration files

thanks ajacoutot@@ for checking and improvements for the desktop
integration files, and Roberto Fernandez for looking over the
fontres parts.

@import Fitz/MuPDF. incomplete copyright notices so PERMIT_* are
disabled for now. "i'm stunned by the quality and that it doesn't
choke on a recent document[0] where xpdf had issues with" simon@@
(who also helped tracking down the key bindings, thanks!).


Fitz is a project to create a new and modern graphics library.
At the core of Fitz is the display tree: a scene graph of vector
graphics, images and text making up the contents of a page.

The standard components of Fitz are:

    * Base runtime (thin memory and error handling layer)
    * Streams and filters (standard postscript, pdf and tiff filters)
    * World model (display trees and resources)
    * Drawing (draw the tree to a bitmap raster) 

MuPDF is a PDF parser that reads PDF files and creates Fitz trees.

MuPDF also has an API to modify internal objects in the PDF files
and write PDF files. For instance, it is possible to use the MuPDF
library to encrypt existing PDF files, or to rearrange the pages.

pdftool is a commandline demo of this functionality; it is a portable
pdf swiss army knife for fixing broken pdf files, changing permissions,
merging and extracting pages, and examining the internal object
structure of a PDF file.

The mupdf binary (aka pdfview) is a bare bones PDF viewer.
