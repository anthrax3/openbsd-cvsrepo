@update to wdiff 1.0.1, from Pascal Stumpf.
- while there, replace a poorly-formatted DESCR with newer text from upstream
@
text
@wdiff is a front end to diff for comparing files on a word per word basis.
A word is anything between whitespace. This is useful for comparing two texts
in which a few words have been changed and for which paragraphs have been
refilled. It works by creating two temporary files, one word per line, and
then executes diff on these files. It collects the diff output and uses it
to produce a nicer display of word differences between the original files.
@


1.2
log
@- Remove FreeBSDisms, cleanup Makefile
- Trim DESCR to a reasonable level and format it nicely
- Rename & sync patches to unified diff with update-patches

wdiff  compares  two  files, finding which words have been
deleted or added to old_file to get new_file.  A  word  is
anything  between whitespace.  The output is collected and
used to produce an annotated copy of new_file on  standard
output.  Suitable  annotations  produce  a nice display of
word differences between the original files.

   From man page of wdiff:
       wdiff  compares  two  files, finding which words have been
       deleted or added to old_file to get new_file.  A  word  is
       anything  between whitespace.  The output is collected and
       used to produce an annotated copy of new_file on  standard
       output.  Suitable  annotations  produce  a nice display of
       word differences between the original files.

  Example:
	text-a
		I like FreeBSD.
	text-b
		I love FreeBSD.

	% wdiff -n text-a text-b
	I [-like-] {+love+} FreeBSD.
