Sablotron is an attempt to develop fast, compact and portable XSLT
processor.

It is an open project; other users and developers are encouraged
to use it or to help test or improve it. The goal of this project
is to create a reliable and fast XSLT processor conforming to the
W3C specification, which is available for public viewing, and can
be used as a base for multi-platform XML data distribution systems.
