text
@XML::RSS::Parser is a lightweight liberal parser of RSS feeds. This
parser is "liberal" in that it does not demand compliance of a specific
RSS version and will attempt to gracefully handle tags it does not
expect or understand. The parser's only requirements is that the file is
well-formed XML and remotely resembles RSS. Roughly speaking, well
formed XML with a channel element as a direct sibling or the root tag
and item elements etc.
