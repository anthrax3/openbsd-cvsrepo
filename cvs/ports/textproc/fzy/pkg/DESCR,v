@fzy is a fast, simple fuzzy text selector for the terminal with an advanced
scoring algorithm.

Most other fuzzy matchers sort based on the length of a match. fzy tries
to find the result the user intended. It does this by favouring matches on
consecutive letters and starts of words. This allows matching using acronyms
or different parts of the path.
