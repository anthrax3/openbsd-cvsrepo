@SUBDIR += is wrong: it means the makefile will pick up SUBDIR from env, thus
breaking cd /usr/ports && SUBDIR=some/path make something for
category makefiles. While there, also put spaces around += uniformously.

Prawn: Fast, Nimble PDF Generation For Ruby

Prawn takes the pain out of generating beautiful printable documents,
while still remaining fast, tiny and nimble. It is also named after a
majestic sea creature, and that has to count for something.
It supports UTF-8, image embedding, flexible table drawing and has a
simplified content positioning.
