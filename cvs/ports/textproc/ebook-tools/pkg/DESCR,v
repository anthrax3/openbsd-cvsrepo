@Update to ebook-tools-0.2.2

While at it:

 * Drop documentation, which is mostly useless.  Only headers are actually
   documented, and these are more accessible without doxygen-generated HTML.
 * Remove USE_NINJA stuff - devel/cmake module handles that.
 * Add HOMEPAGE.  There isn't much useful information on SourceForge project
   page, but it is at least a pointer.
 * Rewrite pkg/DESCR for more precision, and mentioned that lit2epub script,
   which is installed with this port, requires clit package.
