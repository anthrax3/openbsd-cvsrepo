@Rasqal is a C library that handles Resource Description Framework
(RDF) query language syntaxes, query construction and execution of
queries returning results as bindings, boolean, RDF graphs/triples
or syntaxes. The supported query languages are SPARQL 1.0, RDQL,
Draft SPARQL Query 1.1, Update 1.1 Syntax and Experimental SPARQL
extensions (LAQRS). Rasqal can write binding query results in the
SPARQL XML, SPARQL JSON, CSV, TSV, HTML, ASCII tables, RDF/XML and
Turtle / N3 and read them in SPARQL XML, RDF/XML and Turtle / N3.

Rasqal was designed to work closely with the Redland RDF library
and the Raptor RDF Syntax Library but is entirely separate from
both.
