1.1
log
@Switch icu4c back to --with-data-packaging=archive to place the data in
a separate file rather than directly in icudata.so to avoid the symbol
size warnings from ld.so.

As this data file is needed at runtime, provide a subpackage containing
a second copy installed under /var/www for use with chrooted web
applications (notably php-intl) that use icu4c. (Applications using
chroot jails other than /var/www will need a further copy of the data
file).

Feedback/ok ajacoutot@@, bumps to follow.
