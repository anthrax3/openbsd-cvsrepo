@TeX::Encode exports the function 'latex_encode' which encodes
characters in a string, that would be incorrectly interpreted by
LaTeX.

The latex_encode function takes a text string and an optional
reference to a hash of options.  The options currently supported
are "exclude" to specify a list of characters that should not be
encoded (often this is "\\{}" to allow LaTeX commands to be used
in the text string), and "iquotes" to enable "intelligent quotes",
that is double quotes around a phrase will be converted to "``" and
"''" and single quotes to "`" and "'".

The scripts directory contains scripts to help build the character
encoding tables used by the module and to create and format a
document listing the characters that the module encodes with their
Unicode character value, HTML entity representation, LaTeX encoding
and visual representation.  These scripts are not installed by "make
install".
