@scrollkeeper-rebuilddb is executed too early. Put it at the end of PLIST to

@Stop scrollkeeper from opening it's "database" once for each *.omf file
without closing it.  A "base" Gnome 2 install has over 160 *.omf files
so this would play havoc with the default open file limits.

Bump version number accordingly.

Also add the scrollkeeper logs to the @@extra list.

@Update to 0.3.12 and regen patches.

until I commit the fix for them shortly.
