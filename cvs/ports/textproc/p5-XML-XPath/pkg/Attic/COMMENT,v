log
@- initial import of p5-XML-XPath-1.04

--
This module aims to comply exactly to the XPath specification at
http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath and yet allow extensions to be added in
the form of functions.

Modules such as XSLT and XPointer may need to do this as they support
functionality beyond XPath.
