--
XML::Writer is a helper module for Perl programs that write an XML
document. The module handles all escaping for attribute values and
character data and constructs different types of markup, such as
tags, comments, and processing instructions.

By default, the module performs several well-formedness checks to
catch errors during output. This behaviour can be extremely useful
during development and debugging, but it can be turned off for
production-grade code.

The module can operate either in regular mode in or Namespace
processing mode. In Namespace mode, the module will generate Namespace
Declarations itself, and will perform additional checks on the
output.

Additional support is available for a simplified data mode with no
mixed content: newlines are automatically inserted around elements
and elements can optionally be indented based as their nesting
level.
