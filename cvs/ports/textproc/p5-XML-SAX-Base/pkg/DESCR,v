@XML::SAX::Base is intended for use as a base class for SAX filter modules
and XML parsers generating SAX events.

If you simply wish to build a SAX handler class to 'consume' SAX events you
do not need to use XML::SAX::Base directly although you will need to install
XML::SAX.

This module used to be distributed as part of the XML:SAX distribution but
is now distributed separately and referenced as a dependency by XML::SAX.
