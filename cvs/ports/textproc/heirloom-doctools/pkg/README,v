Running doctools binaries
=========================
The Heirloom doctools consist of many small binaries intimately tied
together, most of them conflicting with groff. To avoid runtime
conflicts, you may wish to prefer Heirloom binaries by prepending
${TRUEPREFIX}/heirloom-doctools/bin to your PATH.

Reading doctools manual pages
=============================
Adding the heirloom-doctools/man directory to man.conf(5) only makes
sense if you do *not* intend to use the groff package in parallel;
otherwise, just set

export MANPATH=${TRUEPREFIX}/heirloom-doctools/man:

in the shell where you want to read Heirloom manuals. Note the trailing
colon.

@Import heirloom-doctools-141101.

The Heirloom Documentation Tools package provides troff, nroff, and
related utilities to format manual pages and other documents for output
on terminals and printers. They are portable and enhanced versions of
the utilities released by Sun as part of OpenSolaris, which are a
variant of ditroff, which, in turn, descends from the historical Unix
troff that generated output for the C/A/T phototypesetter.
