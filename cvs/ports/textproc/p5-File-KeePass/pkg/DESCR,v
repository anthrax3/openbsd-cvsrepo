@File::KeePass gives access to KeePass version 1 (kdb) and version 2
(kdbx) databases.

The version 1 and version 2 databases are very different in
construction, but the majority of information overlaps and many
algorithms are similar. File::KeePass attempts to iron out as many of
the differences.

File::KeePass gives nearly raw data access. There are a few utility
methods for manipulating groups and entries. More advanced manipulation
can easily be layered on top by other modules.
