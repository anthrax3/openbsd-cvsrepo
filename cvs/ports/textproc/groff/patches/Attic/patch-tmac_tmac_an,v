1.2
log
@First major OpenBSD groff update since 2000.
Lots of new functionality, lots of bug fixes, and bringing in
significant maintenance efforts from upstream.
To name just one specific example, the number of arguments mdoc(7)
macros can take is no longer limited.
Two of the more tricky patches contributed by naddy@@, thanks!
Tested in bulk builds by landry@@.
Tested on sparc (GCC 2) by phessler@@ and on alpha (GCC 3) by naddy@@.
ok naddy@@, landry@@

Before using this to build ports, make sure you install
the src/usr.sbin/pkg_add/OpenBSD/PackingElement.pm patch
i'm going to commit right afterwards as well, or you will end up
with ports manuals containing ANSI escape sequences.
