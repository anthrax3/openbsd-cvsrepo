@General cleanup:
* Unbreak groff manuals by using tbl(1); reported by pascal@@.
* Deal with our Mdocdate cvs keyword; as designed by jmc@@ in 2007.
* Use troffrc for OpenBSD config changes; suggested by Werner Lemberg.
* Unbreak the hdtbl examples; from upstream.
* Volume names in man(7) page headers; suggested by Yuri Pankov.
* Update various string tables; coordinated with upstream.
* Add a README explaining local changes; using feedback from pascal@@.
* Better description and bump.
ok pascal@@, and tested in an i386 bulk build by naddy@@, thanks!
