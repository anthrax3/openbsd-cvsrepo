+-----------------------------------------------------------------------
| Running ${FULLPKGNAME} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Even though roff is a general-purpose typesetting system, the OpenBSD
groff port is focussed on formatting ports(7) manuals that mandoc(1)
is unable to handle.  To make groff output as similar as possible to
mandoc output, the following two groff features have been disabled by
default: adjustment of text to the right margin and hyphenation.

If you want to use groff for serious typesetting work and need these
features, please set up your own troff(1) configuration file:

  mkdir ~/.tmac
  cp ${TRUEPREFIX}/share/groff/current/tmac/troffrc ~/.tmac/
  export GROFF_TMAC_PATH=~/.tmac

In your new troffrc file, uncomment these two lines to enable
hyphenation:

.do hpf hyphen.us
.do hpfa hyphenex.us

Delete these three lines to enable the roff `ad' request, such that
documents can adjust text to the right margin:

.ad l
.de ad
..

In case you dislike the default string "OpenBSD ports" in mdoc(7)
manual footers, you can add the the line

.ds default-operating-system my fancy system

to the file ${TRUEPREFIX}/share/groff/site-tmac/mdoc.local.
But don't do that on a machine you intend to build ports(7) on.


To suit the taste of OpenBSD developers, two mdoc(7) formatting
details have been changed with respect to the upstream distribution:

 * Title lines use an n-dash, not an m-dash between the manual page
   name and the manual page description.

 * The .Pa macro always produces emphasized text,
   even in the FILES section.

1.2
log
@In the footers of manuals formatted with groff,
do not print "OpenBSD 5.0" but "OpenBSD ports".
While here, remove some noise from the groff build log.
Bump the groff package.

Technically, this changes the contents of all packages that USE_GROFF,
but please refrain from bumping the world:  Having "OpenBSD 5.0" in
the footers of some ports manual until they are updated the next time,
or until the next libc bump if they aren't, is not a real problem.

To allow automated output comparisons with mandoc(1), the bullet
character \(bu has been changed to just "o" instead of a "+"
superimposed on top of an "o".

1.1
log
@General cleanup:
* Unbreak groff manuals by using tbl(1); reported by pascal@@.
* Deal with our Mdocdate cvs keyword; as designed by jmc@@ in 2007.
* Use troffrc for OpenBSD config changes; suggested by Werner Lemberg.
* Unbreak the hdtbl examples; from upstream.
* Volume names in man(7) page headers; suggested by Yuri Pankov.
* Update various string tables; coordinated with upstream.
* Add a README explaining local changes; using feedback from pascal@@.
* Better description and bump.
ok pascal@@, and tested in an i386 bulk build by naddy@@, thanks!
