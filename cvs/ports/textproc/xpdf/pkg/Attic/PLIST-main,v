@SECURITY: update to xpdf-3.02pl3 which fixes multiple vulnerabilities.
See http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2009-0430.html for details.

Also, fix license marker, update plists and simplify the pkgname
(dropping the pl, which seems to confuse bsd.port.mk's update
target).

@Finally, make xpdf MULTI_PACKAGES, xpdf -main package provides x-depending
parts of xpdf, and xpdf -utils provides non-x-depending parts (replacing the
no_x11 flavor). Appropriate @@conflict marker makes upgrade flawless.
While here, remove dependency on a specific version of auto* (prompted by naddy@@)
(and remember me to never _ever_ touch xpdf again)
