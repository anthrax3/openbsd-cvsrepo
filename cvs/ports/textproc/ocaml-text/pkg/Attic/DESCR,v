@OCaml-Text is a library for dealing with ``text'', i.e. sequence of
unicode characters, in a convenient way

It supports:

  - character encoding/decoding using iconv
  - manipulation of text as UTF-8 encoded strings
  - localised text functions such as compare, upper, ...
  - human readable regular expression inside patterns

In order to be the compatible with other ocaml library without pain,
OCaml-Text choose to use only regular strings for dealing with text.
