1.1.1.1
log
@Import Data::Password 1.12.

This module checks potential passwords for crackability. It checks that
the password is in the appropriate length, that it has enough character
groups, that it does not contain the same characters repeatedly or
ascending or descending characters, or charcters close to each other in
the keyboard. It will also attempt to search the ispell word file for
existance of whole words. The module's policies can be modified by
changing its variables.
