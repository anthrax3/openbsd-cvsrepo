@update to the_silver_searcher-0.18.1, from maintainer Florian Stinglmayr
also update DESCR to add some information from upstream about why it's fast,
ok with Florian.

* Searching for literals (no regex) uses Boyer-Moore-Horspool strstr.
* Files are mmap()ed instead of read into a buffer.
* Regex searches use PCRE 8.21+'s JIT compiler.
* Ag calls pcre_study() before executing the regex on a jillion files.
* Instead of calling fnmatch() on every pattern in your ignore files,
  non-regex patterns are loaded into an array and binary searched.
* Ag uses Pthreads to take advantage of multiple CPU cores and search
  files in parallel.

@The silver searcher (also known as ag) is a fast text searching tool
similar to grep or ack. It performs faster than ack, yet is also aware
of ignore files of git and mercurial repositories and does not search
files listed in ignore files. It further utilises threads and advanced
features of PCRE to further improve performance.
