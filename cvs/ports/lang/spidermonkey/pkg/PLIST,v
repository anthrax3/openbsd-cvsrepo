@install a pkg-config file, there is one in the distfile but it's not part of

1.4
log
@Long awaited update to Spidermonkey 1.9.2.16, needed by upcoming GJS.

Note that this is not js185-1.0.0 distributed by upstream (which is
based on mozilla-2.0), but rather js/src built from firefox 3.6.16
source tarball, so that it works on sparc64 (hence the 1.9.2.16 branch
ersion).
- use patches from www/firefox36 port, remove local patches
- lib got renamed to mozjs, depending ports will be fixed shortly
- use the provided install target instead of rolling our own
- enable ctypes/readline
- regress tests happy on ppc/sparc64/amd64.
