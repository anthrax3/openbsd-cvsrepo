@import tinyscheme 1.40

TinyScheme is a lightweight Scheme interpreter that implements as large
a subset of R5RS as was possible without getting very large and
complicated. It is meant to be used as an embedded scripting interpreter
for other programs. As such, it does not offer IDEs or extensive
toolkits although it does sport a small top-level loop, included
conditionally.
