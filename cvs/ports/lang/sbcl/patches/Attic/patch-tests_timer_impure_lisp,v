@Update lang/sbcl to 1.0.48

This eliminates a number of patches which have been committed
upstream, as well as removes the texlive build dependency. The PDF
documentation is no longer built, which doesn't seem to upset anyone.

@$OpenBSD: patch-tests_timer_impure_lisp,v 1.1 2009/11/17 10:45:00 pirofti Exp $

The timer scheduler seems to only run one timer per SIGALRM and
OpenBSD only delivers ~50 SIGALRMs per second, so it takes ~5 secs to
trigger 200 timers.
