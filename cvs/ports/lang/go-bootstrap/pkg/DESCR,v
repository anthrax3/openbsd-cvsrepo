@Go is an open source programming language that makes it easy to build simple,
reliable, and efficient software.

This package contains a version of Go that builds natively on OpenBSD and can
be used to bootstrap later versions of Go (1.5+) that require an existing Go
compiler to build. It exists for bootstrapping lang/go and is not intended for
general use or distribution.
