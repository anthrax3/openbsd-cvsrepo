1.1
log
@introduce a simple package management facility for lua, by permitting
each package to have an initialization file, and keeping a table of
'<package> = <file>' entries in a known place. these files are loaded
upon lua's activation, and should normally be small, quick pieces of
code responsible for preparing the environment (luapath, cpath) for
the packages they represent.

also, make it possible for every user to have her/his own lua
initialization routines under ~/.lua/init.lua, so that the system-wide
mechanism described above can be replicated to user-specific cases.

prodding, all sorts of ports tutoring and ok jolan@@
