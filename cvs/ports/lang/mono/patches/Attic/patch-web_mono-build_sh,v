@Major update to mono-2.5.
While beeing a development release, this is the most stable version I
used on OpenBSD for now. Several patches are removed as they went
upstream. Thanks to jolan@@ for pointing me at this release and cooking a
couple of patches.

Fix build on powerpc and add it to ONLY_FOR_ARCHS ; slightly tested on
macppc.

A similar port was successfuly tested by jolan@@ on amd64.

no objection alek@@ (maintainer)
ok jolan@@ ok jasper@@
