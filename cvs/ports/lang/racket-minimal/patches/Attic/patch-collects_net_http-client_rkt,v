Racket is a multi-paradigm programming language in the Lisp/Scheme
family, that also serves as a platform for language creation, design,
and implementation.

The primary components of Racket platform are:

- The implementation of Racket (including a rich run-time system,
  various libraries, JIT compiler, and more).
- pkg.racket-lang.org, Racket's web-based package distribution system
  for user-contributed packages.
- raco, command line tool for finding documentation, compiling Racket
  source to bytecode, packaging executables, packaging installable
  archives, and installing packages from remote servers.
