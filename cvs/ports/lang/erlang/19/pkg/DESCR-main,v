@Erlang is a programming language which has many features more commonly
associated with an operating system than with a programming language:
concurrent processes, scheduling, memory management, distribution,
networking, etc.

Erlang was designed at the Ericsson Computer Science Laboratory.
Open-source Erlang is being released to help encourage the spread
of Erlang outside Ericsson.
