@Update to NQP 2015.03.  Move to MoarVM backend.  Dyncall patches are not needed
any more.

@This is "Not Quite Perl" -- a lightweight Perl 6-like environment
for virtual machines.  The key feature of NQP is that it's designed
to be a very small environment (as compared with, say, perl6 or
Rakudo) and is focused on being a high-level way to create compilers
and libraries for virtual machines (such as the Parrot Virtual
Machine, the JVM, and MoarVM).  Unlike a full-fledged implementation
of Perl 6, NQP strives to have as small a runtime footprint as it
can, while still providing a Perl 6 object model and regular
expression engine for the virtual machine.
