1.2
log
@Update to ruby 1.9.3p0.  Adds significant speed improvements and quite
a few new features.  A few of our patches were accepted upstream.

Add an -ri_docs multipackage to hold the ri documentation files.  These
aren't used very often, slow down installation significantly, and bloat
the package.

This also fixes the conflict marker for the -tk multipackage.

@$OpenBSD: patch-ext_socket_lib_socket_rb,v 1.1 2010/11/24 21:28:04 jeremy Exp $

Fix error where Socket.udp_server_sockets without a host argument
will not include sockets for IPv6 link-local addresses.

@Add a PKGSPEC entry to restrict ports depending on lang/ruby/1.9 to
depend on ruby-1.9 and not ruby-1.8.  This PKGSPEC is slightly
different from the previous one used in ruby.port.mk, so all
dependent ports need to be REVISION bumped (which will happen soon).
In addition, since the subpackages depend on the -main package and
also had a slightly different pkgspec, they need to be bumped as well.

In addition, the -main package is also being bumped for the inclusion
of a patch for Addrinfo that fixes a failing IPv6 UDP regression test.
