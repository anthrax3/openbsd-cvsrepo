log
@Update to ruby 1.9.3p0.  Adds significant speed improvements and quite
a few new features.  A few of our patches were accepted upstream.

Add an -ri_docs multipackage to hold the ri documentation files.  These
aren't used very often, slow down installation significantly, and bloat
the package.

This also fixes the conflict marker for the -tk multipackage.
