@Ruby is the interpreted scripting language for quick and
easy object-oriented programming.  It has many features to
process text files and to do system management tasks (as in
Perl).  It is simple, straight-forward, and extensible.

Features of Ruby are shown below.

  - Simple Syntax
  - *Normal* Object-Oriented features(ex. class, method calls)
  - *Advanced* Object-Oriented features(ex. Mix-in, Singleton-method)
  - Operator Overloading
  - Exception Handling
  - Iterators and Closures
  - Garbage Collection
  - Dynamic Loading of Object files(on some architecture)
  - Highly Portable(works on many UNIX machines, and on DOS,
    Windows, Mac, BeOS etc.)
