@Add directory containing gem.build_complete file to ruby gem ext packages

when they are removed.

This requires bumping all ruby gem ext ports, which will happen shortly.

log
@Support building ruby 2.1 packages for gem/extconf ports using the
ruby21 FLAVOR.  Use additional PLIST file for gems with C extensions
for ruby 2.1, to include the gem.build_complete file, which avoids
problems where rubygems attempts to build extensions at runtime.
