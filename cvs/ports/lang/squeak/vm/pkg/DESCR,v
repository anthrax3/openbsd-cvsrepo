1.2
log
@finally update squeak to a more recent version.
as far as I know this should work on 64 bit systems.
@
text
@Squeak is a comprehensive smalltalk 80 system, that was originally
fostered by Apple and Disney.

It also needs an image to work, OpenBSD packages a selection of images
that can be installed, and that will be available under 
${SQUEAK_DIR}

For any serious development, you will have to copy the image in your
workdir to record new changes.

Refer to the web site for other images.

@Basic update to squeak 3.6.
Modify port structure to create several packages more closely based
on distribution (and this is actually simpler to manage).
