log
@Split off camlp4, labltk and graphics from our current OCaml 4.01.
This will help when upgrading to upcoming OCaml 4.02, which will miss camlp4
and labltk.
For a smooth transision, make all OCaml ports BUILD_DEPEND on camlp4 via
MODULES=ocaml.

sysutils/findlib is the only port using -labltk.
graphics/ocaml-camlimage is the only port using -graphics.

@The graphics library provides a set of basic portable
drawing primitives.
Drawing takes place in a separate window that is created
when Graphics.open_graph is called.
