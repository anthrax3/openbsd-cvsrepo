log
@Upgrade OCaml to 4.02. Since camlp4 is now a seperate port,
add / change BUILD_DEPENDS for all ports using camlp4.
Findlib is changed because it won't use camlp4 and doesn't install
the Bytes module anymore, which is now included in OCaml 4.02.

@Split off camlp4, labltk and graphics from our current OCaml 4.01.
This will help when upgrading to upcoming OCaml 4.02, which will miss camlp4
and labltk.
For a smooth transision, make all OCaml ports BUILD_DEPEND on camlp4 via
MODULES=ocaml.

sysutils/findlib is the only port using -labltk.
graphics/ocaml-camlimage is the only port using -graphics.
