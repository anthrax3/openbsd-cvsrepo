Gravity is a powerful, dynamically typed, lightweight, embeddable
programming language written in C without any external dependencies
(except for stdlib). It is a class-based concurrent scripting language
with modern Swift-like syntax.

Gravity supports procedural programming, object-oriented programming,
functional programming and data-driven programming. Thanks to special
built-in methods, it can also be used as a prototype-based programming
language.
