@no-conflict is a lie, the rcscripts conflict.
I'll let robert@@ figure out whether he wants to version the scripts
or what...

@allow for simultaneous install of 5.2 and 5.3 extensions.

This solves some nasty 5.0 -> current update problems.

Up to 5.0, lots of php-using packages were depending on php-mysql-5.2.
So the dependencies would update to php-mysql-5.2 from current.
BUT the php-using packages are now depending on 5.3 -> internal conflict !

With this change, things work again. After the update, you end up with
php-mysql-5.2 AND php-mysql-5.3, you can then try pkg_delete -a to weed
out "unneeded" php*-5.2

okay sthen@@, ajacoutot@@

@update php/5.3 to 5.3.8 and enable fpm support. the original fpm diff
was from william@@ but i had a slightly different approach of implementing
it in the port itself.
