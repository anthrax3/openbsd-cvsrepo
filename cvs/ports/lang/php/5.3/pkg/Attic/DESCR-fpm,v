@PHP-FPM (FastCGI Process Manager) is an alternative PHP FastCGI
implementation with some additional features useful for sites of
any size, especially busier sites.

PHP-FPM also handles running processes in a chroot jail and this
is enabled in the example php-fpm.conf file; adjust this if needed.

@update php/5.3 to 5.3.8 and enable fpm support. the original fpm diff
was from william@@ but i had a slightly different approach of implementing
it in the port itself.
