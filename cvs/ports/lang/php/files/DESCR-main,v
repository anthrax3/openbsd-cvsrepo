@Default to UTC instead of having an undefined timezone.
This can be easily changed per application or system-wide and will allow
some PHP apps to behave right out-of-the-box without the following vomit:

PHP message: PHP Warning:  date(): It is not safe to rely on the system's timezone settings. You are *required* to use the date.timezone setting or the date_default_timezone_set().....

@At the most basic level, PHP can do anything any other CGI program can
do, such as collect form data, generate dynamic page content, or send
and receive cookies.

PHP also has support for talking to other services using protocols such
as IMAP, SNMP, NNTP, POP3, or even HTTP. You can also open raw network
sockets and interact using other protocols.

This package installs a stand-alone binary which can be used for
command-line scripts, as well as an Apache module. It also contains the
pdo_sqlite driver that implements the PHP Data Objects (PDO) interface
to enable access to SQLite 3 databases.

@Merge pdo_sqlite into the core package; we have sqlite3 in base now.

By default this port uses the suhosin patch.
The suhosin patch adds security hardening features to PHP to protect
your servers on the one hand against a number of well known problems in
PHP applications and on the other hand against potential unknown
vulnerabilities within those applications or the PHP core itself.

1.1.1.1
log
@Import a reworked port of php to lang/php. The basic difference is that
there are no core and extensions packages anymore, everything is built by
the main ports itself and the package names have changed to php-${V} or
php-mysql-${V} for modules.

The new ports allows you to install all of the php versions just like python
so you can actually run different webservers with different versions of php
because you can't load two modules to one. You can only do that with fastcgi.

The port tries to share all the files that can be shared and the different
extensions are located in the local version's Makefile instead of Makefile.inc.

The other change is that *all* of the configuration has moved to /etc out
of /var/www because that was a realy stupid concept, since apache if you
use it chrooted, will load all of the extensions before doing the actual
chroot.

This port is not linked to the build yet because several issues have to
be resolved first, like providing a way to update from php5-* packages,
and probably other things that do not come into my mind right now,
because the Bullfrog is making me crazy.
