1.1
log
@Make lang/go work with clang.

This requires three changes:

- OpenBSD clang produces __guard_local symbols that are marked as hidden,
  which causes problems with the go linker. Workaround this by explicitly
  making __guard_local symbols visible when reading in an ELF object.

- OpenBSD clang currently fails to correctly report the compiler runtime
  via --print-libgcc-file-name. Workaround this issue by hardcoding it
  for the time being.

- The TestCgoConsistentResults test passes successfully outside of ports,
  however fails under a ports build. This requires further investigation
  but we can just skip the test for now.
