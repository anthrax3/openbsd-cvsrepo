1.1
log
@Pugs.Types defined an Eq instance for Control.Concurrent.STM.TMVar (from
the stm package), which is no longer possible, because TMVar is deriving
Eq now. So move the (somewhat crude)  comparision based on addressOf (which
comes from the hs-pugs-compat package) into Pugs.AST.Types, providing an
explicit Eq instance for VThread.

IMHO, instance declarations for standard type classes on types imported
from other Haskell packages are evil.

Breakage noticed by naddy@@.

While here, update WANTLIB and bump.
