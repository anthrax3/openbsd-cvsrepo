@Update to racket 6, plus some additional changes.

Tested by bcallah@@ (i386), jturner@@ (amd64) and me (both platforms).

Help and OK from jturner@@ to an old similar diff. Change from
RUN_DEPENDS to LIB_DEPENDS of some deps suggested by sthen@@ and OK
from him.

@$OpenBSD: patch-src_racket_src_mzstkchk_h,v 1.1 2013/10/16 19:22:37 juanfra Exp $

Upstream's commit message:
"OpenBSD provides pthread_stackseg_np(), which directly reports
the stack-bounds information that Racket needs, so we can use
that instead of the approach used on other Unix variants. The
approach used for other Unix variants seems not to work for OpenBSD
because the stack location at the point that main() is called
is already significantly far from the stack base (on the order
of 100k on a 32-bit system in my test using OpenBSD 5.2)."

Test: racket -e '(load "deep.rktl")'

@Now racket manages correctly the stack size on OpenBSD.

ok sthen@@.
