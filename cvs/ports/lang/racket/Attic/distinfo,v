@Update to racket 6.1.1.

The installation of the shared lib is not recommended by upstream and
nobody is using it, so I'm removing the lib from the package.

Racket (formerly called PLT Scheme) is a multi-paradigm programming
language in the Lisp/Scheme family, that also serves as a platform for
language creation, design, and implementation.

The primary components of Racket platform are:

- The implementation of Racket (including a rich run-time system,
  various libraries, JIT compiler, and more).
- DrRacket (formerly named DrScheme), the Racket program development
  environment.
- Teachpacks to use together with various books.
- pkg.racket-lang.org, Racket's web-based package distribution system
  for user-contributed packages.
- raco, command line tool for finding documentation, compiling Racket
  source to bytecode, packaging executables, and packaging installable
  archives.
