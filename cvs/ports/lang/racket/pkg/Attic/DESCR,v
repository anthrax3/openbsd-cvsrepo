@Racket is a multi-paradigm programming language in the Lisp/Scheme
family, that also serves as a platform for language creation, design,
and implementation.

The primary components of Racket platform are:

- The implementation of Racket (including a rich run-time system,
  various libraries, JIT compiler, and more).
- DrRacket, the Racket program development environment.
- Teachpacks to use together with various books.
- pkg.racket-lang.org, Racket's web-based package distribution system
  for user-contributed packages.
- raco, command line tool for finding documentation, compiling Racket
  source to bytecode, packaging executables, packaging installable
  archives, and installing packages from remote servers.

@Update to racket 6, plus some additional changes.

Tested by bcallah@@ (i386), jturner@@ (amd64) and me (both platforms).

Help and OK from jturner@@ to an old similar diff. Change from
RUN_DEPENDS to LIB_DEPENDS of some deps suggested by sthen@@ and OK
from him.
