| Running ${FULLPKGNAME} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Known issues
============

- Some examples of ffi-lib don't work.

- Due to lack of thread-local storage support on OpenBSD, "places" and
  "futures" are disabled.

Limitations
===========

Racket only supports CPUs with SSE extension.

@Update to racket 6, plus some additional changes.

Tested by bcallah@@ (i386), jturner@@ (amd64) and me (both platforms).

Help and OK from jturner@@ to an old similar diff. Change from
RUN_DEPENDS to LIB_DEPENDS of some deps suggested by sthen@@ and OK
from him.

- Racket and Scribble crash with a segfault in some specific situations due to
  the limits imposed by OpenBSD. If this happens, check the limits of the shell
  and login.conf.

Racket (formerly called PLT Scheme) is a multi-paradigm programming
language in the Lisp/Scheme family, that also serves as a platform for
language creation, design, and implementation.

The primary components of Racket platform are:

- The implementation of Racket (including a rich run-time system,
  various libraries, JIT compiler, and more).
- DrRacket (formerly named DrScheme), the Racket program development
  environment.
- Teachpacks to use together with various books.
- pkg.racket-lang.org, Racket's web-based package distribution system
  for user-contributed packages.
- raco, command line tool for finding documentation, compiling Racket
  source to bytecode, packaging executables, and packaging installable
  archives.
