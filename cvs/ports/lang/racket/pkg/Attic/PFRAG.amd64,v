Racket (formerly called PLT Scheme) is a multi-paradigm programming
language in the Lisp/Scheme family, that also serves as a platform for
language creation, design, and implementation.

The primary components of Racket platform are:

- The implementation of Racket (including a rich run-time system,
  various libraries, JIT compiler, and more).
- DrRacket (formerly named DrScheme), the Racket program development
  environment.
- Teachpacks to use together with various books.
- pkg.racket-lang.org, Racket's web-based package distribution system
  for user-contributed packages.
- raco, command line tool for finding documentation, compiling Racket
  source to bytecode, packaging executables, and packaging installable
  archives.
