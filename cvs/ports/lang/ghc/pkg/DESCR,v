@The Glasgow Haskell Compiler is a state-of-the-art, open source, compiler and
interactive environment for the functional language Haskell. Highlights:

   * GHC supports the entire Haskell 98 language plus a wide variety of
     extensions.
   * GHC works on several platforms including Windows and a few varieties of
     Unix, and a few different processor architectures. There are detailed
     instructions for porting GHC to a new platform. Which doesn't work.
   * GHC has extensive optimisation capabilities, including inter-module
     optimisation.
   * GHC compiles Haskell code either by using an intermediate C compiler
     (GCC), or by generating native code on most currently supported
     platforms. The interactive environment compiles Haskell to
     bytecode, and supports execution of mixed bytecode/compiled
     programs.
   * Profiling is supported, both by time/allocation and various kinds of
     heap profiling.
   * GHC comes with a minimal range of libraries, but a wide range of
     additional libraries are available as separate packages, including
     the full set of the Haskell Platform.

GHC compiles Haskell to either native code or C. It implements
numerous experimental language extensions to Haskell 98, for example:
concurrency, a foreign language interface, multi-parameter type
classes, scoped type variables, existential and universal quantification,
unboxed types, exceptions, weak pointers, and so on. GHC comes with
a generational garbage collector, and a space and time profiler.

@Allow ghc to work with external libgmp instead of building its own; this
