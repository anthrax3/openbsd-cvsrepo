@Update from maintainer Don Stewart (dons at cse.unsw.edu.au):

- Updated to ghc-6.0
- Halved (roughly) the build time; by using the 6.0 in-tree build
we only have to build the 6.0 libraries once. Also we only build the
necessary parts of the bootstrap compiler.
- The ugly lndir/stage1 build is also gone.
- The full ghc regression suite is now part of the port!
"make regress" will run around 3000 regress tests.
- The regression tests revealed that the C foreign function
- The Makefile is simplified, using more default targets
- The documentation is updated to 6.0
- I put some of the 5.04.3 patches into ghc cvs, so they are
now obsolete.

Unfortunately, this lets mozilla back in the race for longest
package building time...
