1.1
log
@Change ghc.port.mk to allow addition of flags to MODGHC_SETUP_PROG by
just setting MODGHC_SETUP_CONF_ARGS (which is now empty by default).

Add dblatex-created documentation.

While here, use our INSTALL* macros where possible to get correct
permissions (noticed by dcoppa@@). This does *not* fix the permissions
of libraries and interface files installed by Cabal-based tools,
because the permissions are hard-coded in Cabal, and I'm not going
to touch and fix Cabal ever, because IMHO it's completely broken
by design. (If you want to read some of this madness, have a look
at libraries/Cabal/Distribution/Compat/CopyFile.hs or even
libraries/Cabal/Distribution/Simple/Install.hs)

Expect some breakage of depending ports (at least of devel/darcs) and
some necessary WANTLIB changes, which will be fixed soonish.
