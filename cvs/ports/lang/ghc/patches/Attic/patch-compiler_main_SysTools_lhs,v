Our ld(1) doesn't understand those options.

@Bugfix udpate to ghc-7.8.4.
Also, use a new(er) bootstrapper; note that we have to use 7.8.3
for this, because if the built ghc and the bootstrapper have identical
versions, things will fail badly. May be it's not the ghc but the
cabal version which is problematic, but at the moment, I really
don'y call about *this* problem.
Still marked as broken. I hope to send promised diffs and new ports
for discussion tomorrow and then enable ghc and haskell-platform
on monday.

@Update to ghc-7.8.3, but mark as broken until all other
hs ports are done.

Please note that it still doesn't use shared libraries, so
still no ghci (and a lot of hs-ports not buildable) on i386.
