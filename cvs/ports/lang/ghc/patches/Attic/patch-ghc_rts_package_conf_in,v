Update to 6.6.1. With helpful hints from Don Stewart and espie@@.
Thanks to all the testers and to steven@@, who was so kind to
build the HC files for bootstrapping on amd64.

@$OpenBSD: patch-ghc_rts_package_conf_in,v 1.3 2004/04/26 23:48:50 dons Exp $
Added extra ld options for the runtime system so it can find
libgmp. There is code in mk/package.mk that will:
	s/LOCALBASE/${LOCALBASE}/
so that this points to the right place. This is required so that
Haskell programs, which pull in the shared runtime system, can
find gmp.

@Allow ghc to work with external libgmp instead of building its own; this
will help with the sparc port.
