@$OpenBSD: patch-___ghc-4_08_2_ghc_rts_MBlock_c,v 1.2 2003/08/01 14:03:40 avsm Exp $
In -current, mmap'd data wants to start at 0x60089000, on my
build machine. I presume this is because data all got moved above the
1G line for W^X...pushing everything up?

Anyway, MBlock.c is implemented properly (i.e. always gets MBLOCK_SIZE
aligned data) in 5.04.3, so this is just a quick hack for the
bootstrap compiler.

The Glasgow Haskell Compiler is a robust, fully-featured, optimising
compiler for the functional programming language Haskell 98.

GHC compiles Haskell to either native code or C. It implements
numerous experimental language extensions to Haskell, including
concurrency, a foreign language interface, several type-system
extensions, exceptions, and so on. GHC comes with a generational
garbage collector, a space and time profiler, and a comprehensive
set of libraries.
