1.2
log
@Update to ghc-7.4.2, but keep it marked as broken (and not only for amd64).

Most of the -nopie changes are from pascal@@ (thanks); I only had to
merge them for ghc-7.4 and tweak configure and mk/config.mk.in.

@For now, disable PIE in GHC.  This will be revisited later on by kili@@ in the
next update.  And again, calling stuff "PIC" is a bad idea ...

ok kili@@
