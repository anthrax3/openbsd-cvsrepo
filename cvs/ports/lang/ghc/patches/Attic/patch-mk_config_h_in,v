@Update from maintainer Don Stewart (dons at cse.unsw.edu.au):

- Updated to ghc-6.0
- Halved (roughly) the build time; by using the 6.0 in-tree build
we only have to build the 6.0 libraries once. Also we only build the
necessary parts of the bootstrap compiler.
- The ugly lndir/stage1 build is also gone.
- The full ghc regression suite is now part of the port!
"make regress" will run around 3000 regress tests.
- The regression tests revealed that the C foreign function
- The Makefile is simplified, using more default targets
- The documentation is updated to 6.0
- I put some of the 5.04.3 patches into ghc cvs, so they are
now obsolete.

Unfortunately, this lets mozilla back in the race for longest
package building time...

The Glasgow Haskell Compiler is a robust, fully-featured, optimising
compiler for the functional programming language Haskell 98.

GHC compiles Haskell to either native code or C. It implements
numerous experimental language extensions to Haskell, including
concurrency, a foreign language interface, several type-system
extensions, exceptions, and so on. GHC comes with a generational
garbage collector, a space and time profiler, and a comprehensive
set of libraries.
