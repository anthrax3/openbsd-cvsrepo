@Update to ghc-7.8.3, but mark as broken until all other

Please note that it still doesn't use shared libraries, so
still no ghci (and a lot of hs-ports not buildable) on i386.

@Update to ghc-6.12.3 (bugfix release), plus some minor changes:

- Use integer-gmp again.

- Cleanout the extracted bootstrap directory right after installing it
  to save some disk space.

- Use ${MAKE_ENV} instead ${MODGHC_SETUP_CONF_ENV} in ghc.port.mk (in
  do-configure, use both).

- Don't compile Setup.l?hs, just use the interpreter (runghc) in
  ghc.port.mk. This speeds up the build of most ports depending on
  ghc and using a cabal-style build.

Necessary bumps and WANTLIB changes in ports using ghc will follow
later this evening.

@Change ghc.port.mk to allow addition of flags to MODGHC_SETUP_PROG by
just setting MODGHC_SETUP_CONF_ARGS (which is now empty by default).

Add dblatex-created documentation.

While here, use our INSTALL* macros where possible to get correct
permissions (noticed by dcoppa@@). This does *not* fix the permissions
of libraries and interface files installed by Cabal-based tools,
because the permissions are hard-coded in Cabal, and I'm not going
to touch and fix Cabal ever, because IMHO it's completely broken
by design. (If you want to read some of this madness, have a look
at libraries/Cabal/Distribution/Compat/CopyFile.hs or even
libraries/Cabal/Distribution/Simple/Install.hs)

Expect some breakage of depending ports (at least of devel/darcs) and
some necessary WANTLIB changes, which will be fixed soonish.

1.2
log

Update to 6.12.2.

Many thanks to Darrin Chandler and dcoppa@@ for testing, reporting about
broken stuff, missing dependencies here and in ports depending on ghc.

Notes and rants:

- Bootstrapping is done using precompiled binaries, since .hc
  bootstrapping still doesn't work. I really hate this.

  THIS MEANS THAT GHC IS NOW AND WILL STAY LEGACY-ONLY (i386 and amd64)

  At least until someone fixes it. I tried for more than two year
  (well, only in my spare time and during my vacations) and failed.

- libgmp is currently disabled, because I didn't yet hack the GHC build
  system to use the system libgmp instead of the patched one included
  in GHC.

- The haddock ncluded in the ghc distfile is replaced by the version
  of haddock found in devel/haddock. Haddock itself is @@commented
  in the ghc PLIST. Unfortunately, this needs an ugly hack that
  introduces an otherwise useless pseudo flavor `no_deps' in
  devel/haddock.

- CLDouble has been removed from GHC some time ago, because it was
  an alias for double (AFAIK there's now support for long double
  in GHC). As this isn't a really big problem, it currently breaks
  c2hs, which I'll mark broken temporarily before committing the
  ghc update.

- The external codeset defaults to latin1 (suggested by Simon Marlow)
  and can be overridden by setting the HS_ENCODING to any codeset
  supported by libiconv.

- ghc.port.mk still needs some love, especially for letting a port add
  additional parameters to certain invocations of ${MODGHC_SETUP_PROG}.
