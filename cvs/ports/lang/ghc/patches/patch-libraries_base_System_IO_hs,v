@Update to ghc-7.8.3, but mark as broken until all other
hs ports are done.

Please note that it still doesn't use shared libraries, so
still no ghci (and a lot of hs-ports not buildable) on i386.

@Update to ghc-7.4.2, but keep it marked as broken (and not only for amd64).

Most of the -nopie changes are from pascal@@ (thanks); I only had to
merge them for ghc-7.4 and tweak configure and mk/config.mk.in.

Update to 6.12.2.

Many thanks to Darrin Chandler and dcoppa@@ for testing, reporting about
broken stuff, missing dependencies here and in ports depending on ghc.

Notes and rants:

- Bootstrapping is done using precompiled binaries, since .hc
  bootstrapping still doesn't work. I really hate this.

  THIS MEANS THAT GHC IS NOW AND WILL STAY LEGACY-ONLY (i386 and amd64)

  At least until someone fixes it. I tried for more than two year
  (well, only in my spare time and during my vacations) and failed.

- libgmp is currently disabled, because I didn't yet hack the GHC build
  system to use the system libgmp instead of the patched one included
  in GHC.

- The haddock ncluded in the ghc distfile is replaced by the version
  of haddock found in devel/haddock. Haddock itself is @@commented
  in the ghc PLIST. Unfortunately, this needs an ugly hack that
  introduces an otherwise useless pseudo flavor `no_deps' in
  devel/haddock.

- CLDouble has been removed from GHC some time ago, because it was
  an alias for double (AFAIK there's now support for long double
  in GHC). As this isn't a really big problem, it currently breaks
  c2hs, which I'll mark broken temporarily before committing the
  ghc update.

- The external codeset defaults to latin1 (suggested by Simon Marlow)
  and can be overridden by setting the HS_ENCODING to any codeset
  supported by libiconv.

- ghc.port.mk still needs some love, especially for letting a port add
  additional parameters to certain invocations of ${MODGHC_SETUP_PROG}.
