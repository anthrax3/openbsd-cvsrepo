@I've simply checked my test results against a run-of-the-mill installation
on a redhat linux system for differences...

Here are the differences:
-----------------------------------------------------------
FAIL: gcc.c-torture/execute/ieee/rbug.c execution,  -O0 
FAIL: gcc.c-torture/execute/ieee/rbug.c execution,  -O1 
FAIL: gcc.c-torture/execute/ieee/rbug.c execution,  -O2 
FAIL: gcc.c-torture/execute/ieee/rbug.c execution,  -O2 -g 
FAIL: gcc.c-torture/execute/ieee/rbug.c execution,  -Os 
FAIL: gcc.dg/980414-1.c (test for excess errors)
FAIL: g++.law/profile1.C (test for excess errors)
XPASS: g++.robertl/eb132.C (test for excess errors)
-----------------------------------------------------------
This is the test summary:

                === libio Summary ===

# of expected passes            40

                === libstdc++ Summary ===

# of expected passes            30

                === gcc Summary ===

# of expected passes            7490
# of unexpected failures        16
# of expected failures          7
# of unsupported tests          11

                === g++ Summary ===

# of expected passes            4220
# of unexpected failures        1
# of unexpected successes       2
# of expected failures          84
# of untested testcases         7
--------

Here is the corresponding test under gcc 2.8.1 (the actual numbers differ as
gcc does not support -Os)

                === gcc Summary ===

# of expected passes            6312
# of unexpected failures        42
# of expected failures          6
# of unsupported tests          11

                === g++ Summary ===

# of expected passes            3622
# of unexpected failures        462
# of unexpected successes       2
# of expected failures          221
# of untested testcases         7

There is one bug in gcc 2.8.1 that also shows up in egcs under standard 
OpenBSD configuration: if using -finline-functions, gcc emits stabs lines
for CTORS at an incorrect position. Hence, the linker no longer finds the
CTORS, hence everything breaks down. This has been reported to egcs-bugs.

The way we get around this problem is by relying on collect2: egcs is
built with use_collect2=yes, so it does no longer relies on stabs for
propert CTOR collection, and the bug is no longer visible.
