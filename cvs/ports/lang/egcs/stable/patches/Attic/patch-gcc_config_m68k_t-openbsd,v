Slightly better configuration:
- add patches from OpenBSD-current, to multilib libgcc as -fpic
- fix asm emitting code on i386, to avoid dwarf2 stuff. Similar patches
may be needed for other a.out arches...
- fix comment on i386.
- add -L/usr/lib/debug.
- finish -shared support.

Misc. configury:
- try to ensure libffi, libjava, fastjar will configure. So far, ld dumps
core in libjava though...

Use gmake for now, as it does not build completely with our make...

Still missing shared library pieces...
