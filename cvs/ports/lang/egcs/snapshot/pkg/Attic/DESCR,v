@OpenBSD currently ships with a slightly modified gcc 2.95.3, which 
should be adequate for most people.

Selected changes:

* gcc 3.2 is much slower compiling than gcc 2.95.
* integrated preprocessor, somewhat better diagnostics.
* much better C++ support, almost fully ISO compliant.
* better C++ template diagnostics.
* better code generation, (scheduling on newer intel platforms), sparc64,
and others...
* function at-a-time compile and tree based inliner, that should give
better results than the old inliner.
* profiler-directed optimizations.
* built-in for mmx (needs new gas though) or altivec.
* integrated ada and java compiler (boehm-gc does not work on OpenBSD yet).
* more robust, especially where odd compile options are concerned.

egcs is an experimental spin-off of gcc that started when people got 
fed up waiting for gcc 2.8. As the C++ standard finally emerged,
egcs people strove trying to implement as much of it as possible.

Egcs proved to be a successful project, to the extent that it now is
the official gnu compiler, relabelled gcc 2.95 for its first release.

OpenBSD 2.7 ships with gcc 2.95.2, which should be adequate for most
people.

The main reason for the egcs/snapshot port is to make it easier for 
interested parties to track current egcs development and report bugs
(specific or not to OpenBSD), so that when the next release comes, we
are ready to integrate it.

From a user point of view, you may need some features that the port
provides.

There have been a lot of changes since gcc 2.95.2, this is just a quick
summary of a few:

* the intel scheduler has been revamped. It's more efficient on hundreds
of little details,
* other arches have known important internal improvement. m68k pic support
should be better. HP-PA has most of PA2.0 support in,
* internal memory handling now uses a garbage collector. Eventually egcs
should become faster, more robust and less memory-hungry (this is already 
the case in many circumstances),
* the back-end specifications have been tightened, so that many bugs have
been found,
* the C++ compiler now uses one-function-at-a-time tree representations.
More optimizations are possible,
* the design of varargs facilities has been completely changed,
* loads of new warnings and new optimizations.

See http://egcs.cygnus.com for more details.

@Argh. I was SURE I had repaired that port WEEKS ago.
So, here goes.

- retrieve a recent snapshot of egcs, to justify the port's existence,
- remove outdated fixes, now that we're synching with 2.6,
- update patches to deal with the current snapshot,
- get a description that matches better what's going on,
- add fixed include files to match the new varargs handling (complexity
is now within gcc, instead of arch-dependent include files).

Builds on i386, at least.

Accordingly, egcs C++ compiler is more suitable for C++ development as
gnu gcc.  Its library approaches the standard, template support is almost
complete, namespace support is coming in, it also includes a newer
scheduler (haifa) that gives improved results on HPRisc and Alpha
architecture.  
d5 2
a6 2
There is some on-going work in egcs that makes it interesting to make
a recent snapshot available.

Notably, the standard C++ library has been updated to a version much closer 
to the ANSI standard.  The namespace support is much better than the
release version.
d11 24

Also, there is some on-going work in improving numerical computations
with C++.  


Finally, some flavors of the scheduler have been improved.
For instance, there is a new sparc scheduler that is not available as
a release yet.  

On the other hand, work upon the integration of pgcc with mainline egcs
is not ready yet.

As of ss-19980921, there are some problems: gmake bootstrap fails during the
build of libstdc++. Restarting gmake from that point finishes
the build. Accordingly, the tests show a regression in libstdc++... it
seems that either the build is not truely okay, or eg++ has trouble finding
some of its files...

This port is used for people who want/need to use a very recent version
of egcs. It tracks the latest snapshots. At any given point, it's likely
to be somewhat broken. Use egcs-stable for the released version.
