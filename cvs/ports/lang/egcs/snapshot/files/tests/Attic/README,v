@Resurrect snapshot port, easy to do,since it's the gcc 3.1 branch.
@
text
@testing procedure: 
- obtain a RECENT snapshot of dejagnu from egcs.cygnus.com.
I've just upgraded to dejagnu-981026, check
ftp://egcs.cygnus.com/pub/egcs/infrastructure.
It's dreadfully easy to build it, just a trivial adaptation of the existing
dejagnu port.

- make build should now BOTH build the snapshot AND build the checks.
You will also find a `warnings' file in the work/egcs-* directory...
- have a look at work/source/contrib... this is what you need to analyze
the test results.

OpenBSD notes:
* you need an up-to-date bsd.port.mk.
* an assembler bug that affects the sparc has been fixed post-2.4. It may
affect other architectures. Basically, the archs that use an old gas
(m68k, sparc, i386,...) are liable to run into bugs that can be traced to
the assembler, not the compiler.
* the configuration files used are substantially cleaned up from gcc 2.8.1.
This will be used for gcc 2.8.1 eventually.

To run the same testsuites under native gcc 2.8.1:
- move the site.exp file elsewhere, edit it to get the right paths.
- remove the -Os option from the various testsuite drivers, gcc 2.8.1 
does not support -Os...
- run with e.g., GCC=/usr/bin/gcc runtest --tool gcc

@Add needed stuff to rs6000/xm-openbsd.h, configure this,
correct patch-core-mkstemp,
describe dejagnu snapshot more correctly in files/tests

@partial archives are no longer bogus.

i386/openbsd.h does include unix.h which yields a perfectly good definition
of the *THUNK macro.

trivial fix to a bug in gcc.c.

I've used dejagnu-980528 for my tests. Installation should be easy.
It was almost a drop-in for dejagnu-1.3 in my case.

@Moving stuff around, now that we have a better Makefile.
More configurability, newer snapshot, and killed gnu-make

* we are trying to use BSD make instead of gnu-make. A large proportion
of the patches are used for that. They have been reported to cygnus, and
will probably be unnecessary soon.

Edit framework.exp to remove *.core instead of core in case of failure...
- uncomment the egcs-test... line in the Makefile.
- after build, go to work/egcs-1.1b and perform a gmake check...
you may wish to use script to record the results as you go...
Look in the work/egcs-1.1b/gcc/testsuite directory for more details.
Disregard g77 tests until g77 is ported over.
