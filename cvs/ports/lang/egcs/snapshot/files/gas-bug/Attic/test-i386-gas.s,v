@Argh. I was SURE I had repaired that port WEEKS ago.
So, here goes.

- retrieve a recent snapshot of egcs, to justify the port's existence,
- remove outdated fixes, now that we're synching with 2.6,
- update patches to deal with the current snapshot,
- get a description that matches better what's going on,
- add fixed include files to match the new varargs handling (complexity
is now within gcc, instead of arch-dependent include files).

Builds on i386, at least.
