@Argh. I was SURE I had repaired that port WEEKS ago.
So, here goes.

- retrieve a recent snapshot of egcs, to justify the port's existence,
- remove outdated fixes, now that we're synching with 2.6,
- update patches to deal with the current snapshot,
- get a description that matches better what's going on,
- add fixed include files to match the new varargs handling (complexity
is now within gcc, instead of arch-dependent include files).

Builds on i386, at least.

@Update to 990907, including i386 test results,
- use contrib/egcs-update instead of rolling our own,
- autoreconf does not perform as I expected, autoconf does.

@Testsuite wanted installed libstdc++, because libstdc++.a link was not done
properly.

Clean a few odds & ends of main configuration.

Fix a long-standing bug that let libgcc.a get rebuilt again and again,
e.g., once for make build, once for make install
