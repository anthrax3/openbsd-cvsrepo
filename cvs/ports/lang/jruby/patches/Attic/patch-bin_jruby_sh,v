1.2
log
@Update jruby to 1.6.0.  This version adds ruby 1.9 syntax support,
as well as experimental C extension support, and many other
significant new features.

Bump required memory to 384MB, should fix occassional memory
errors when building.

Use the jruby-complete.jar instead of the jruby.jar, seems
to be necessary for C extension support to work correctly.

RSpec is no longer bundled.  Additionally, the extra 1.5.3
distfile is no longer needed as the changes have been included
upstream.
