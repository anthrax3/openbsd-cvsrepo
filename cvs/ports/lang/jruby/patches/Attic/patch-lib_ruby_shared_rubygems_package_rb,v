@Update to jruby 1.7.6. Add maven as a test dependency, since it is
required to run the tests.  Remove rubygems patch as it was applied
upstream.

@Update to jruby-1.7.5.  Upstream changed to a maven-based src build
system that downloads 190+ .jar files at build time.  Switch to using
the binary distribution, since there is no point compiling java source
code to java bytecode when we can use the precompiled java bytecode.

Use our custom jnr-posix distfile with 64-bit time_t support by
directly patching jruby.jar.

Add jruby-launcher gem as a separate distfile, but since we only need
the binary, compile it manually and don't install the gem.

Still keep the src distfile for the tests, because the binary distfile
doesn't include them.

Add patch to work around rubygems regression with .files in the root
of the gem not getting installed (already accepted upstream).
