@Setup symlink to jruby/bin/jruby at bin/jruby, so that jruby is usable
without any modifications to PATH.  To run an ruby program that is
installed in jruby's bin directory (which no longer needs to be in the
PATH), use jruby -S program.

@Please add ${JRUBY_HOME}/bin to your PATH to access the JRuby programs.

the port.
