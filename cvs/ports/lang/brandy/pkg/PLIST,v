Brandy implements Basic V, the dialect of Basic that Acorn Computers
supplied with their ranges of desktop computers that use the ARM
processor such as the Archimedes and RiscPC. Basic V is an extended
version of BBC Basic. This was the Basic used on the BBC Micro that
Acorn made during the early 1980s.
