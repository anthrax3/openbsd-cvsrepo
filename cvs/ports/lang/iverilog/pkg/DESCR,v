@Icarus Verilog is a Verilog simulation and synthesis tool. It operates
as a compiler, compiling source code writen in Verilog (IEEE-1364) into
some target format. For batch simulation, the compiler can generate an
intermediate form called vvp assembly. This intermediate form is
executed by the "vvp" command. For synthesis, the compiler generates
netlists in the desired format.

The compiler proper is intended to parse and elaborate design
descriptions written to the IEEE standard IEEE Std 1364-2005. This is a
fairly large and complex standard, so it will take some time for it to
get there, but that's the goal.

code that is compiled and linked with a run time library (called "vvm")
then executed as a command to run the simulation. For synthesis, the
