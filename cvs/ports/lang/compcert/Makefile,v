@import lang/compcert. ok sthen@@

The CompCert C verified compiler is a compiler for a large subset
of the C programming language that generates code for the PowerPC,
ARM and x86 processors.

The distinguishing feature of CompCert is that it has been formally
verified using the Coq proof assistant: the generated assembly code
is formally guaranteed to behave as prescribed by the semantics of
the source C code.

CompCert is not free software. This non-commercial release can only
be used for evaluation, research, educational and personal purposes.
