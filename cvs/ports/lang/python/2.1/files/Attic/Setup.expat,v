# Interface to the Expat XML parser
#
# Expat is written by James Clark and must be downloaded separately
# (see below).  The pyexpat module was written by Paul Prescod after a
# prototype by Jack Jansen.
#
# The Expat dist includes Windows .lib and .dll files.  Home page is at
# http://www.jclark.com/xml/expat.html, the current production release is
# always ftp://ftp.jclark.com/pub/xml/expat.zip.
#
# EXPAT_DIR, below, should point to the expat/ directory created by
# unpacking the Expat source distribution.
#
# Note: the expat build process doesn't yet build a libexpat.a; you can
# do this manually while we try convince the author to add it.  To do so,
# cd to EXPAT_DIR, run "make" if you have not done so, then run:
#
#    ar cr libexpat.a xmltok/*.o xmlparse/*.o

@more cleanups in preparation for 2.2 update and 2.3 import from
Aleksander Piotrowski <aleksander dot piotrowski at nic dot com dot pl>

- fix MASTER_SITES
- --without-pymalloc is not needed in 2.1 and 2.2 as it is disabled by default
  this will allow using it in 2.3
- some PREFIX -> LOCALBASE cleanup
- patch distributed pydoc instead of providing our own 3-liner
- some improvements on sparc64
- teach regression suite about openbsd
- regen some patch files

1.1
log
@Python 2.1.2 and Python 2.2.

Major changes:

- no more threads flavor, threads is now the default.

- subpackage modules that depend on other packages instead of having
largely redundant flavors (unless platform has no shared libs, then
flavors count again)

- shared libpython stuff disabled until someone can figure out why
it makes Zope crash
