1.2
log
@Restore shared libpython.  The problem was that pthreads' 64k stack
size is not adequate for some of the complex processing that Zope
does, and -fPIC was aggravating that condition.  Now, if we're using
shared libs, up the stack size to 128k.

Also remove some stray files that never should have been committed
in the first place.

1.1
log
@Python 2.1.2 and Python 2.2.

Major changes:

- no more threads flavor, threads is now the default.

- subpackage modules that depend on other packages instead of having
largely redundant flavors (unless platform has no shared libs, then
flavors count again)

- shared libpython stuff disabled until someone can figure out why
it makes Zope crash
