@Fix security issue with Python 2.1/2.2

Zack Weinberg found a vulnerability in the way the exevpe() method
from the os.py module uses a temporary file name. A file which
supposedly should not exist is created in a unsafe way and the method
tries to execute it. The objective of such code is to discover what
error the operating system returns in a portable way.

By exploiting this vulnerability a local attacker can execute
arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running python code
which uses the execvpe() method.

@upgrade to 2.1.3

2.1.3 has very few improvements over 2.1.2, but the most important
are some thread-safety fixes that were causing heavily loaded Zope
sites to keel over.

@Python 2.1.2 and Python 2.2.

Major changes:

- no more threads flavor, threads is now the default.

- subpackage modules that depend on other packages instead of having
largely redundant flavors (unless platform has no shared libs, then
flavors count again)

- shared libpython stuff disabled until someone can figure out why
it makes Zope crash
