@fix slightly borked packaging:

- idle was incorrectly included in the -main package, not the -idle
  subpackage. Move these to where they belong.

- The -main package installed a ${LOCALBASE}/python-config, which
  would conflict with future python versions. Remove this and add
  a MESSAGE suggesting users symlink python-config2.5 to it if
  necessary

- An Emacs .el files was also installed by the -main package, this
  too would conflict with parallel installs of different major
  releases. Move this to the -tools subpackage.
