@GC python 2.5.  Thanks to zhuk who made this possible.

@Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming
language that combines remarkable power with very clear syntax. For
an introduction to programming in Python you are referred to the
Python Tutorial. The Python Library Reference documents built-in
and standard types, constants, functions and modules. Finally, the
Python Reference Manual describes the syntax and semantics of the
core language in (perhaps too) much detail.

Python's basic power can be extended with your own modules written
in C or C++.  On most systems such modules may be dynamically loaded.
Python is also adaptable as an extension language for existing
applications. See the internal documentation for hints.

This package contains extra tools that Python users may find useful
as well as a Python mode for Emacs.

@fix slightly borked packaging:

- idle was incorrectly included in the -main package, not the -idle
  subpackage. Move these to where they belong.

- The -main package installed a ${LOCALBASE}/python-config, which
  would conflict with future python versions. Remove this and add
  a MESSAGE suggesting users symlink python-config2.5 to it if
  necessary

- An Emacs .el files was also installed by the -main package, this
  too would conflict with parallel installs of different major
  releases. Move this to the -tools subpackage.
