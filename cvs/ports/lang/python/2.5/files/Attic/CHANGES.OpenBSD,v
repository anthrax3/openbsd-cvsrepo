@GC python 2.5.  Thanks to zhuk who made this possible.

As required by item 3 of the PSF license, here is a brief summary
of changes made to this version of Python for the OpenBSD package.

1.  tempfile.py was patched to not try /usr/tmp as a possible
    tempfile directory.

2.  libpython is created as a shared library, and the pthread stack
    size was doubled to support this with complex applications such
    as Zope.

3.  OpenBSD threads are used for threading support.

4.  The interpreter is called "python2.5" in order to support multiple
    versions of Python coexisting on the same system.  The same
    applies to the idle and pydoc binaries.

5.  Regression tests have been taught about OpenBSD.

6.  Support for MIPS64 and MIPS64EL systems has been enabled for the
    _ctypes Module.

7.  INSTSONAME was incorrect, configure.in was patched to fix it.

These changes are available in the OpenBSD CVS repository
<http://www.openbsd.org/anoncvs.html> in ports/lang/python.

log
@Allow Python to build on loongson.  Bring in some libffi fixes, inspired
by jasper@@'s fixes to the libffi port.

Mark mips64 (aka, sgi) as BROKEN, as the build fails.  We'll look closer
at this after unlock.

OK jasper@@

ports is unlocked for a while only for those who have been informed.

    versions of Python coexisting on the same system.  If no "python"
    binary exists, a symlink to "python2.5" is created when package
    is installed.
    Same process applies to IDLE binary (idle) and pydoc.
