@Python 2.1.2 and Python 2.2.

Major changes:

- no more threads flavor, threads is now the default.

- subpackage modules that depend on other packages instead of having
largely redundant flavors (unless platform has no shared libs, then
flavors count again)

- shared libpython stuff disabled until someone can figure out why
it makes Zope crash

text
@Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented
programming language that combines remarkable power with
very clear syntax. For an introduction to programming in
Python you are referred to the Python Tutorial. The Python
Library Reference documents built-in and standard types,
constants, functions and modules. Finally, the Python
Reference Manual describes the syntax and semantics of the
core language in (perhaps too) much detail.

Python's basic power can be extended with your own modules
written in C or C++.  On most systems such modules may be
dynamically loaded. Python is also adaptable as an
extension language for existing applications. See the
internal documentation for hints.

Flavors:
	tk       - builds tkinter module, depends on Tk
	threads  - build with thread support
	no_tools - do not build tools package
