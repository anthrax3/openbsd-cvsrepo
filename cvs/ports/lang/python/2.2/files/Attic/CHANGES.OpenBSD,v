@As required by item 3 of the PSF license, here is a brief summary
of changes made to this version of Python for the OpenBSD package.

1.  tempfile.py was patched to not try /usr/tmp as a possible
    tempfile directory.

2.  libpython is created as a shared library, and the pthread stack
    size was doubled to support this with complex applications such
    as Zope.

3.  OpenBSD threads are used for threading support.

4.  The interpreter is called "python2.1" in order to support multiple
    versions of Python coexisting on the same system.  If no "python"
    binary exists, a symlink to "python2.1" is created when package
    is installed.
    Same process applies to IDLE binary (idle) and pydoc.

5.  Regression tests have been taught about OpenBSD.

These changes are available in the OpenBSD CVS repository
<http://www.openbsd.org/anoncvs.html> in ports/lang/python.

@more cleanups in preparation for 2.2 update and 2.3 import from
Aleksander Piotrowski <aleksander dot piotrowski at nic dot com dot pl>

- fix MASTER_SITES
- --without-pymalloc is not needed in 2.1 and 2.2 as it is disabled by default
  this will allow using it in 2.3
- some PREFIX -> LOCALBASE cleanup
- patch distributed pydoc instead of providing our own 3-liner
- some improvements on sparc64
- teach regression suite about openbsd
- regen some patch files

6.  _localemodule.c was changed so it would build.

7.  __va_copy was used where appropriate so python would work on
    non-i386 architectures such as powerpc.
