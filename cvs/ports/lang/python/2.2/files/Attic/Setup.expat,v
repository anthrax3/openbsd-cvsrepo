# Interface to the Expat XML parser
#
# Expat was written by James Clark and is now maintained by a group of
# developers on SourceForge; see www.libexpat.org for more
# information.  The pyexpat module was written by Paul Prescod after a
# prototype by Jack Jansen.  Expat 1.95.2 is the recommended version
# of Expat for use with Python.  Usage of a system shared
# libexpat.so/expat.dll is not advised; a static version of the
# library is sufficient.
#
# The Expat library should be installed so that the linker will find
# it properly.
#
# More information on Expat can be found at www.libexpat.org.

@more cleanups in preparation for 2.2 update and 2.3 import from
Aleksander Piotrowski <aleksander dot piotrowski at nic dot com dot pl>

- fix MASTER_SITES
- --without-pymalloc is not needed in 2.1 and 2.2 as it is disabled by default
  this will allow using it in 2.3
- some PREFIX -> LOCALBASE cleanup
- patch distributed pydoc instead of providing our own 3-liner
- some improvements on sparc64
- teach regression suite about openbsd
- regen some patch files

1.1
log
@Python 2.1.2 and Python 2.2.

Major changes:

- no more threads flavor, threads is now the default.

- subpackage modules that depend on other packages instead of having
largely redundant flavors (unless platform has no shared libs, then
flavors count again)

- shared libpython stuff disabled until someone can figure out why
it makes Zope crash
