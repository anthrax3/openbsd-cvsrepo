1.1
log
@Python 2.1.2 and Python 2.2.

Major changes:

- no more threads flavor, threads is now the default.

- subpackage modules that depend on other packages instead of having
largely redundant flavors (unless platform has no shared libs, then
flavors count again)

- shared libpython stuff disabled until someone can figure out why
it makes Zope crash
