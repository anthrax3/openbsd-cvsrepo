1.2
log
@- revert the handling of async callbacks pre 2.7 for the time being. this
  fixes the hangs and some other problems and allow us to move further while
  a proper fix is investigated. as a result remove the patches to test_io
  and test_socket, they are ok now.
- remove the distutils diff. it doesn't seem right, nobody really knows why
  it's there and it actually breaks things with this version.
- bump
discussed and ok rpointel martynas sthen djm
