As required by item 3 of the PSF license, here is a brief summary
of changes made to this version of Python for the OpenBSD package.

1.  Regression tests have been taught about OpenBSD.

2.  INSTSONAME could be incorrect, configure.ac was patched to fix it.

3.  RAND_egd support has been disabled, as it is not available in LibreSSL.

These changes are available in the OpenBSD CVS repository
<http://www.openbsd.org/anoncvs.html> in ports/lang/python/2.7.

@Update python 2.7 to 2.7.4.

This is a slighly different version that I sent that includes an updated
kqueue diff that works with python 2 and 3 and puts test_bsddb and
test_bsddb3 back on the skip list as they're not built outside amd64
and i386.

Only 2 tests are known to fail: test_kqueue (broken) and test_threading
(failing on 2.7.3, under investigation but likely broken). If something
else fails please send your test.log.

Tested on a bulk by landry, sparc64 by brad, ppc gonzalo and amd64 by me.

2.  libpython is created as a shared library, and the pthread stack
    size was doubled to support this with complex applications such
    as Zope.
