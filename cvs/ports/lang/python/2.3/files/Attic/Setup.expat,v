# Interface to the Expat XML parser

# Expat was written by James Clark and is now maintained by a group of
# developers on SourceForge; see www.libexpat.org for more
# information.  The pyexpat module was written by Paul Prescod after a
# prototype by Jack Jansen.  Source of Expat 1.95.2 is included in
# Modules/expat/.  Usage of a system shared libexpat.so/expat.dll is
# not advised.

# More information on Expat can be found at www.libexpat.org.
