log
@10 years ago, we needed to build python with c++ to make sure modules
with native c++ code worked fine.  We no longer need to do that, and
llvm errors out with the non-sensical combination of "c++ -std=c99".

this fixes the python build on arm64

tested by sthen@@ in an i386 bulk, thanks!

OK sthen@@, rpointel@@ (maintainer)
