As required by item 3 of the PSF license, here is a brief summary
of changes made to this version of Python for the OpenBSD package.

1.  tempfile.py was patched to not try /usr/tmp as a possible
    tempfile directory.

2.  libpython is created as a shared library, and the pthread stack
    size was doubled to support this with complex applications such
    as Zope.

3.  OpenBSD threads are used for threading support.

4.  The interpreter is called "python2.4" in order to support multiple
    versions of Python coexisting on the same system.  The same
    applies to the idle and pydoc binaries.

5.  Regression tests have been taught about OpenBSD.

These changes are available in the OpenBSD CVS repository
<http://www.openbsd.org/anoncvs.html> in ports/lang/python.

@documentation fix: we don't automatically create symbolic links,
also be consistant with binary names, and move rcsid to the top.

    versions of Python coexisting on the same system.  If no "python"
    binary exists, a symlink to "python2.4" is created when package
    is installed.
    Same process applies to IDLE binary (idle) and pydoc.

@Import python 2.4

Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented
programming language that combines remarkable power with
very clear syntax.

tested by djm@@ and mpech@@ (but more tests are needed!)
