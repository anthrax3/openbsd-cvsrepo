@Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented
programming language that combines remarkable power with
very clear syntax. For an introduction to programming in
Python you are referred to the Python Tutorial. The Python
Library Reference documents built-in and standard types,
constants, functions and modules. Finally, the Python
Reference Manual describes the syntax and semantics of the
core language in (perhaps too) much detail.

Python's basic power can be extended with your own modules
written in C or C++.  On most systems such modules may be
dynamically loaded. Python is also adaptable as an
extension language for existing applications. See the
internal documentation for hints.

Flavors:
	tk       - builds tkinter module, depends on Tk
	threads  - build with thread support
	no_tools - do not build tools package
