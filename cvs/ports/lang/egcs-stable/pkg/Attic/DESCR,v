@egcs is an experimental spin-off of gcc that started when people got 
fed up waiting for gcc 2.8. As the C++ standard finally emerged,
egcs people strove trying to implement as much of it as possible.
Accordingly, egcs C++ compiler is more suitable for C++ development as
gnu gcc.  Its library approaches the standard, template support is almost
complete, namespace support is coming in, it also includes a newer
scheduler (haifa) that gives improved results on HPRisc and Alpha
architecture.  Hopefully, most features of egcs will migrate to 
gcc over time...

I still have to port over and check the g77, objective-C and java
front-end. egcs' g77 is more advanced and integrated than GNU-cc g++.

See http://egcs.cygnus.com for more details.

This port is used for people who need egcs, the experimental gcc compiler
developped by cygnus.  egcs fixes lots of bugs compared to gcc 2.8.1.
In exchange, it adds some new ones.  It's pretty useful for C++ development.
