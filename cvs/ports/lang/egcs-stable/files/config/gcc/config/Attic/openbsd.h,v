/* Common OpenBSD configuration. 
   All OpenBSD architectures include this file, which is intended as
   a repository for common defines. 

   Some defines are common to all architectures, a few of them are
   triggered by OBSD_* guards, so that we won't override architecture
   defaults by mistakes.

   OBSD_HAS_CORRECT_SPECS: 
      another mechanism provides correct specs already.
   OBSD_NO_DYNAMIC_LIBRARIES: 
      no implementation of dynamic libraries.
   OBSD_OLD_GAS: 
      older flavor of gas which needs help for PIC.
   OBSD_HAS_DECLARE_FUNCTION_NAME, OBSD_HAS_DECLARE_FUNCTION_SIZE,
   OBSD_HAS_DECLARE_OBJECT: 
      PIC support, FUNCTION_NAME/FUNCTION_SIZE are independent, whereas
      the corresponding logic for OBJECTS is necessarily coupled.

   There are also a few `default' defines such as ASM_WEAKEN_LABEL,
   intended as common ground for arch that don't provide 
   anything suitable.  */
