@import tcl 8.5

Highlights of Tcl 8.5

    * Speed: 8.5 now runs 10% faster than 8.4 with bytecode
      improvements, object caching and reduced memory usage.
    * Bignums: Tcl now supports arbitrary-precision integers,
      which improves math operations on large integers.
    * Safer interps: Tcl's powerful safe interpreter mechanism
      now has improved control of time and command limits in
      slave interpreters.
    * clock command: More robust implementation of command for
      specifying time, with significant l10n and i18n
      improvements.
    * dict command: New data structure that allows access to
      data by value rather than a variable name, which is
      substantially faster.
    * Additional improvements: Faster list search, new and
      improved mathematics procedures, anonymous procedures, new
      ways to package Tcl extensions, Tcl-level custom channel
      types, file and line location information for each
      command, and more.
