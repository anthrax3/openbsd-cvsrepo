@Bye bye 8.4.

@Tcl (Tool Command Language) is a very powerful but easy to learn dynamic
programming language, suitable for a very wide range of uses, including
web and desktop applications, networking, administration, testing and
many more. Open source and business-friendly, Tcl is a mature yet
evolving language that is truly cross platform, easily deployed and
highly extensible.

Tcl/Tk resources:
  Newsgroup: comp.lang.tcl
  Wiki: http://wiki.tcl.tk
  Book: Practical Programming in Tcl and Tk, 4th Edition
        ISBN: 0-13-038560-3

"The Tcl Core Team is pleased to announce the 8.4.20 releases of the Tcl
dynamic language and the Tk toolkit.  This is the twentieth and *FINAL*
patch release of Tcl/Tk 8.4.  With this release, support for Tcl/Tk 8.4
comes to an end.  The current release sequence for Tcl and Tk is 8.6.*.
All Tcl/Tk users are encouraged to migrate to that release sequence for
future work."

"Routine maintenance of Tcl/Tk 8.4 has now come to an end.  We intend
Tcl/Tk 8.4.19 to be the final 8.4.* releases.  The current stable
releases of Tcl/Tk are 8.5.2, and development has begun on Tcl/Tk 8.6.
It is possible that a bug fix of great enough importance or severity
might prompt a release of 8.4.20, but there is no plan for that at the
moment.  Even that level of support will fade away quickly."

This is Tcl8.4, an embeddable tool command language. It is an easy-to-use
scripting language with clear syntax. Because it is a scripting
language, programs written in it are easily portable to other operating 
systems. Feature include networking functionality, string and number
manipulation, and regular expression support.

A rich set of extensions to the language are available, as well.

The best way to get started with Tcl is to read ``Practical Programming in
TCL and Tk, 4th Edition'' by Brent Welch and Ken Jones, Prentice Hall PTR,
ISBN 0-13-038560-3.  There's also the collectable ``Tcl and the Tk
Toolkit'' by John K. Ousterhout, Addison-Wesley, ISBN 0-20-163337-X.

A full set of manual pages is also provided with this package.
