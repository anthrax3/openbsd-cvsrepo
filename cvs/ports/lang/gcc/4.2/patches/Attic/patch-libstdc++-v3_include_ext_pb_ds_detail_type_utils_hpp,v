@Enable sjlj exceptions by default because the other implementation does not
work on OpenBSD, and exceptions are hevaily used by OpenOffice.Org.

Backport PR libstdc++/31481 from GCC repository because this fix is needed
by openoffice:
	PR libstdc++/31481
	* include/ext/type_traits.h (__numeric_traits): Move...
	* include/ext/numeric_traits.h: ... here; fix type of
	__max_digits10.
	* include/ext/pb_ds/detail/type_utils.hpp: Include
	<ext/numeric_traits.h> too.
	* include/tr1/random: Likewise.

Tested with both openoffice and webkit. bump needed PKGNAMEs;
