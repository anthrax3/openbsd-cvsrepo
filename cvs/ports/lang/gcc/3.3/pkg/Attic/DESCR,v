@tedu older version of gcc

@Some OpenBSD platforms ship with a slightly modified gcc 2.95.3, other
ship with a modified gcc 3.3.5.

This port is an almost carbon-copy of the compiler in-tree, with a few
differences:

- it's taken off a more recent snapshot from gcc 3.3 branch.

- it's not the system compiler, and so it looks for includes in /usr/local,
and for libraries in /usr/local/lib.

- it can bootstrap itself fully, including ada on i386, and java (though
java does not yet work. There's an issue with boehm-gc).

- it may build on platforms for which system gcc is still 2.95.3.

There are other gcc ports in the tree, all of them correspond to more
recent branches of gcc (at least 3.4 and 4.0 as of this writing). They
may or may not build on your platform.

OpenBSD currently ships with a slightly modified gcc 2.95.3, which 
should be adequate for most people.

* gcc 3.2 is much slower compiling than gcc 2.95.
* integrated preprocessor, somewhat better diagnostics.
* much better C++ support, almost fully ISO compliant.
* better C++ template diagnostics.
* better code generation, (scheduling on newer intel platforms), sparc64,
and others...
* function at-a-time compile and tree based inliner, that should give
better results than the old inliner.
* profiler-directed optimizations.
* built-in for mmx (needs new gas though) or altivec.
* integrated ada and java compiler (boehm-gc does not work on OpenBSD yet).
* more robust, especially where odd compile options are concerned.
