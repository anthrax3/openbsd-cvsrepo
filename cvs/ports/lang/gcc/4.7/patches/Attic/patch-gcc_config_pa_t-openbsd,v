@Update to gcc 4.7.1.

- add some fixes for hppa, though it still isn't ready for prime time yet.
  Chances are it will only work with -O1, pending testing.  Many optimisations
  lead to broken code and segfaults on hppa.  Joint work with jsg@@.
- fix libstdc++ upgrade path
- bring in recent fixes for execinfo/magic.h from 4.6
