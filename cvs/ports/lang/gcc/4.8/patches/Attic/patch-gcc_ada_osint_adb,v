@$OpenBSD: patch-gcc_ada_osint_adb,v 1.1 2015/01/08 20:23:21 pascal Exp $

GNAT tools try to guess the name of the gcc binary by looking at their
own prefix and suffix. Subsequently they're trying to compile code using
the base gcc if argv[0] does't start with "e".
This hack to their name-guessing hack fixes the problem while touching the
least amount of files.

@Update to GCC 4.8.4.

Additionally, from tobiasu@@:

Disable the optimized shared Ada.Strings.Unbounded implementation until
overlapping memcpy() is fixed. Requires fresh adastrap's.

Rename all binaries starting with "egnat" back to "gnat". Reduces the
amount of workarounds needed to build various Ada software - including
GNAT itself.

Stop running the fixincludes script - saves time and pain. If our
headers are broken, we want to know and fix them ourselves, thank you
very much.

Drop gnat debug patch for a linker issue that was fixed some time ago.
