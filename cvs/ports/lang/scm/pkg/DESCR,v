@Scm conforms to Revised^5 Report on the Algorithmic Language Scheme
and the IEEE P1178 specification.  Scm is written in C and runs under
Amiga, Atari-ST, MacOS, MS-DOS, OS/2, NOS/VE, Unicos, VMS, Unix and
similar systems.  ASCII and EBCDIC are supported.

Documentation is included explaining the many Scheme Language
extensions in scm, the internal representation and how to extend or
include scm in other programs.

SLIB is a portable Scheme library which SCM uses.

-- OpenBSD issues

1.  Pathname dependencies:
	The init file is hardcoded as ${PREFIX}/share/scm/Init.scm.
	Alternatively, one can set the environment variable SCM_INIT_PATH to
	the pathname of Init.scm.

	The library files are in ${PREFIX}/share/scm/slib.  Alternatively,
	one can set the environment variable SCHEME_LIBRARY_PATH to
	the slib directory.  Remember to use a trailing / on the
	pathname.

2.  Documentation:
	People not familiar with scheme may wish to install scheme-report
	as well.

3.  Sicp compliance:
	Two interpreters, scm and scm-sicp, are compiled by default.
	scm conforms to R^5, scm-sicp to SCIP. If you don't know what I'm
	talking about, use scm.

@Scheme port, loosely based on FreeBSD port.
Still needs some work (check that shared libraries work, add X11
support...)
