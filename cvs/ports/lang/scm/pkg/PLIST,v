@Clean up a few details.
- segregate slib in a separate directory, install a few more files for it
(ready for a separate package, whenever we get another scheme).
- let dynamic loading work on archaic a.out systems.
- install a few more *.scm programs. Probably misses a few files for a
full infrastructure to build other extensions (should create a libscm.a
on static systems ?)

- allows for x11 extension, even though it's very basic.

Flavorize it.

Issue: flavor sicp ?
