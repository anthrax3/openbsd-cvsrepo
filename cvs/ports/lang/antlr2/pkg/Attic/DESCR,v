@ANTLR, ANother Tool for Language Recognition, (formerly PCCTS) is a
language tool that provides a framework for constructing recognizers,
compilers, and translators from grammatical descriptions containing
Java, C#, Python, or C++ actions.

ANTLR is popular because it is easy to understand, powerful, flexible,
generates human-readable output, and comes with complete source.  ANTLR
provides excellent support for tree construction, tree walking, and
translation.

@parser generator for Java, C#, Python, or C++ languages

ANTLR, ANother Tool for Language Recognition, (formerly PCCTS) is a
language tool that provides a framework for constructing recognizers,
compilers, and translators from grammatical descriptions containing
Java, C#, Python, or C++ actions.

Currently installing the precompiled jar since this is needed for
classpath 0.98 as a BUILD_DEPEND and RUN_DEPEND.
