/* Common OpenBSD configuration. 
   All OpenBSD architectures include this file, which is intended as
   a repository for common defines. 

   Some defines are common to all architectures, a few of them are
   triggered by OBSD_* guards, so that we won't override architecture
   defaults by mistakes.

   OBSD_HAS_CORRECT_SPECS: 
      another mechanism provides correct specs already.
   OBSD_NO_DYNAMIC_LIBRARIES: 
      no implementation of dynamic libraries.
   OBSD_OLD_GAS: 
      older flavor of gas which needs help for PIC.
   OBSD_HAS_DECLARE_FUNCTION_NAME, OBSD_HAS_DECLARE_FUNCTION_SIZE,
   OBSD_HAS_DECLARE_OBJECT: 
      PIC support, FUNCTION_NAME/FUNCTION_SIZE are independent, whereas
      the corresponding logic for OBJECTS is necessarily coupled.

@- fixed up i386/*VTABLE once more... this time for good.
- clean up openbsd.h comments
- add patch to auto-detect mkstemps. Accordingly, need to run
autoreconf in gcc and in libiberty.

@Update to 990103 snapshot.
Inform user of the warnings file in case of a bootstrap crash.

Major change: add alpha & pa configuration, and clean up ALL
openbsd configuration files thoroughly... this is probably going to
break a few things.
