XXX not quite sure why this is needed as it's built without PIE anyway, but
this fixes a segfault on i386 during build following the switch to PIE by
default.

@Fix segfault during build with PIE-by-default on i386 by not using %ebx there.
Not quite sure why this is needed as it looks to be built without PIE
anyway, so XXX comment added to patch, but this makes things work.

N.B. regression tests fail, "error: objects are initialised from 1st to last
(should be from last to 1st) - undefine constant OBJ_CHAIN_REVERSE_ORDER in
obj_chain.h" but this is not new and they also fail on amd64.

Regen distinfo while there.
