@Kawa is a programming language for the Java platform. It is an
implementation of Scheme (R7RS), which, is in the Lisp family of
programming languages. Kawa has many useful features, including
convenient integration with Java. It can be used as a "scripting
language", but includes a compiler and all the benefits of a "real"
programming language, including optional static typing, so Kawa programs
can be as efficient as Java.  Kawa is also a useful framework for
implementing other programming languages on the Java platform. It has
has many useful utility classes.
