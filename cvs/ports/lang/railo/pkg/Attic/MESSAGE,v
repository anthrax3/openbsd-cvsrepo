@update to railo-4.2.1.008

@!!NOTE!! The update to Tomcat 7.0.52 has made changes which prevent the
         configuration method used in older versions of Railo's README
         from working.

The README has now been updated, but existing installations will be broken
unless ${CATALINA_BASE}/conf/context.xml is modified to change "<Context>" to
"<Context xmlBlockExternal="false">.

as well (to be removed after next release) so that people upgrading production
