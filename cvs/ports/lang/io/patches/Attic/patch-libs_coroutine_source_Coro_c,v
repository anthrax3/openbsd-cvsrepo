@Remove lang/io

Broken since the introduction of setjmp cookies (May on amd64, June on
i386).  Was i386/amd64 only.  I couldn't get newer versions to work,
and it's unlikely that the setjmp cookie issue could be worked around
without rewriting the coroutine code.

@$OpenBSD: patch-libs_coroutine_source_Coro_c,v 1.1 2012/12/17 23:55:28 jeremy Exp $

On amd64, thread stacks must be 16-byte aligned, it's required by
the ABI.  Without this, a bus error occurs when formatting a
number as a string, inside snprintf, since it uses the movaps
instruction to move data from the xmm0 register to a non 16-byte
aligned memory location.

@Import lang/io 20110905

Io is a prototype-based programming language inspired by Smalltalk (all
values are objects, all messages are dynamic), Self (prototype-based),
NewtonScript (differential inheritance), Act1 (actors and futures for
concurrency), LISP (code is a runtime inspectable/modifiable tree) and
Lua (small, embeddable).
