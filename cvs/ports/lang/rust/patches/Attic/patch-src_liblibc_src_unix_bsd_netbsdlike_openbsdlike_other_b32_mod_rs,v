@Update to rust 1.15.1.

- switch to rustbuild build system instead of configure (the world
  definitely needed one more build system!)
- the build still takes +INF hours, this is being investigated

Note that rust will be a hard-requirement for gecko 54... sigh.

Tested by semarie@@ and myself on i386 & amd64.

All the hard work and countless build hours by semarie@@, thanks!
