@Wnn4.2 is a Japanese/Chinese/Korean input method.  
This is the Japanese version.

This is originally based on the FreeBSD port, with contributions by

Yoshio KATAYAMA <kate@@pfu.co.jp>

The OpenBSD port separates the dictionaries into a separate package
(ja-Wnn-dict-4.2) that installs under /var/dict.

@Split dictionary into a separate package, using MULTI_PACKAGES.
(so that dictionaries install into /var/dict).

Note that ja-Wnn and ja-Wnn-dict do not depend on each other.
The installation `polish' script in Wnn-data should know how to take
care of that.

This is Wnn4.2, a Japanese/Chinese/Korean input method.  It is
included primarily so that we can compile mule-2.1, a multilingual
emacs.

Only the Japanese version is build for this port.

Note that binaries and libraries go to /usr/local, while man pages and 
includes go to /usr/X11R6.  That's the way it was designed, I don't
know why.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

This also include some patches for FreeBSD or bugfix.
If use this patches, you can compile Wnn-4.2 under XFree86 3.1.2E
 or later(X11Release6.1).
If there are any problem in this patches, please know me via E-mail.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Mr. Yoshio KATAYAMA <kate@@pfu.co.jp> fixed many bugs for Wnn4.2.
Patches for those are in 'Wnn4.2.patch.tar.gz' and are applied in this
port.

[Notice]
When compiling by this ports, if $LOCALBASE is not '/usr/local' and/or
$X11BASE is not '/usr/X11R6' then you should properly change two lines
'@@cwd /usr/local' and '@@cwd /usr/X11R6' in
$PORTSDIR/japanese/Wnn/pkg/PLIST.
