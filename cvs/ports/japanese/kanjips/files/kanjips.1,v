.Sh NAME
.Nm kanjips
.Nd "scan convert japanese fonts to bitmap fonts in a PostScript document"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm kanjips
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a filter that reads PostScript files with Japanese fonts, and converts
the fonts to a bitmap representation that is suitable for printing on
a simple PostScript printer.
.Pp
Even if Japanese PostScript fonts are available, it may be unadvisable
to download megabytes of data just to print a single page in draft mode.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -compact -width /usr/local/share/kanjips_fonts
.It Pa /usr/local/share/kanjips_fonts
Path to the bitmap fonts jis24, jis32, jis48.
.El
.Sh LIMITATIONS
.Nm
is only configured to use bitmap fonts. It would also be able to use 
bdf X11 fonts or metafont pk fonts, but not, for instance, pcf fonts,
which is what X11 currently uses.
.Pp
.Nm
is fairly simplistic in its recognition of japanese strings. The only
program outputting PostScript that 
.Nm
can process is probably
.Xr jenscript 1 .
.Pp
.Nm
uses a simple strategy and encodes bitmap fonts on a page basis.
Hence, it does not cache data from printed page to printed page.
Hence, it does only work with structured PostScript documents that 
use proper page boundaries.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr jenscript 1
