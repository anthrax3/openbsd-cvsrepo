@update to minicom 2.5
- rolls in a huge bunch of wprintf patches, also fixes conflict with getline()
- note that the setuid support has been removed from the code
@
text
@minicom is installed with permissions set at 555.

To allow users to run minicom, you should put them in group dialer.

If you wish to use ${SYSCONFDIR}/minicom/minicom.users to restrict
user behaviour to specific configurations or ports, then you
must change the permissions on ${PREFIX}/bin/minicom to be mode 4551
owned by uucp:dialer and *not* put users in group dialer.
