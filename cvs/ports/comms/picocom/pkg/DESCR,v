@As its name suggests, picocom is a minimal dumb-terminal emulation
program.  It is, in principle, very much like minicom, only it's pico
instead of mini!

Picocom was designed to serve as a simple, manual, modem configuration,
testing, and debugging tool. It has also served (quite well) as a
low-tech "terminal-window" to allow operator intervention in PPP
connection scripts (something like the ms-windows "open terminal window
before / after dialing" feature). It could also prove useful in many
other similar tasks.

Picocom is ideal for embedded systems since its memory footprint is
minimal (less than 20K, when stripped).

@Import Picocom.

Picocom is a minimal dumb-terminal emulation program.

Picocom was designed to serve as a simple, manual, modem configuration,
