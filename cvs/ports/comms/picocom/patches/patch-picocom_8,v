@Update to picocom 1.7, from Kyle Isom (maintainer).

The picocom.8 patch is from schwarze@@; it fixes the man page to show
content that was completely lost during formatting due to badly broken
syntax.

Tested by Kyle on amd64 and sgi, and myself on i386.

 During the picocom session, if you key the "send" or "receive" commands (e.g. by pressing C-a, C-s, or C-a, C-r) you will be prompted for a filename. At this prompt you can enter one or more file-names, and any additional arguments to the transmission or reception program. After that, picocom will start the the external program as specified by the "--send-cmd", or "--receive-cmd" option, and with any filenames and additional arguments you may have supplied. The standard input and output of the external program will be connected to the serial port. The standard error of the external program will be connected to the terminal which---while the program is running---will revert to canonical mode. Pressing 'C-c' while the external program is running will prematurely terminate it, and return control to
