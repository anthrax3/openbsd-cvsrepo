@Update to picocom 1.7, from Kyle Isom (maintainer).

The picocom.8 patch is from schwarze@@; it fixes the man page to show
content that was completely lost during formatting due to badly broken
syntax.

Tested by Kyle on amd64 and sgi, and myself on i386.

1.1.1.1
log
@Import Picocom.

Picocom is a minimal dumb-terminal emulation program.

Picocom was designed to serve as a simple, manual, modem configuration,
testing, and debugging tool. It has also served (quite well) as a
low-tech "terminal-window" to allow operator intervention in PPP
connection scripts (something like the ms-windows "open terminal window
before / after dialing" feature). It could also prove useful in many
other similar tasks.

From Kyle Isom (thank you!), with tweaks by me and giovanni@@.
