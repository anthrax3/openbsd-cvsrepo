@Update to picocom 1.7, from Kyle Isom (maintainer).

The picocom.8 patch is from schwarze@@; it fixes the man page to show
content that was completely lost during formatting due to badly broken
syntax.

Tested by Kyle on amd64 and sgi, and myself on i386.

@Import Picocom.

Picocom is a minimal dumb-terminal emulation program.

Picocom was designed to serve as a simple, manual, modem configuration,
testing, and debugging tool. It has also served (quite well) as a
low-tech "terminal-window" to allow operator intervention in PPP
connection scripts (something like the ms-windows "open terminal window
before / after dialing" feature). It could also prove useful in many
other similar tasks.

From Kyle Isom (thank you!), with tweaks by me and giovanni@@.
