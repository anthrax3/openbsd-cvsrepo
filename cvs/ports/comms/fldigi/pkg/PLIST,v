program that is used for both transmitting and receiving data in any of the
following modes:

BPSK and QPSK        31, 63, 125, 250 (both), and 63F and 500 (BPSK only)
PSKR                 125, 250, and 500
CW                   speeds from 5 to 200 wpm
DominoEX             4, 5, 8, 11, 16 and 22; also with FEC
Hellschreiber        Feld Hell, Slow Hell, Hell x5/x9, FSKHell(-105) and Hell 80
MFSK                 4, 8, 11, 16, 22, 31, 32 and 64; most with image support

or cdrom QRZ queries, log QSOs with the built-in logbook or Xlog, and send
reception reports to the PSK Automatic Propagation Reporter.
