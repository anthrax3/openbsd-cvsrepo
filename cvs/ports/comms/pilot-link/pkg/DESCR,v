@Revert removal of pilot-link and jpilot; we still have one user of these...
@
text
@pilot-link is a suite of tools used to connect your Palm or PalmOS(R)
compatible handheld with Unix, Linux, and any other POSIX-compatible
machine. pilot-link works with all PalmOS(R) handhelds, including those
made by Handspring, Sony, and Palm, as well as others.

pilot-link includes userspace "conduits" that allow you to synchronize
information to and from your Palm device, as well as libraries of Palm-
compatible functions that allow other applications to take advantage
of the code included in pilot-link.

There are also several language "bindings" that allow you to use your
favorite development language with pilot-link, such as Java, Tcl, Perl,
and Python.

Pilot-link is a series of tools designed to extract and add data to a
PalmPilot organizer.  There are programs in here to transfer data, debug
the pilot, synchronize with calendars, and a set of include files and
libraries with which you may build your own applications in C, C++,
Perl5, Tcl, Java, and Python.
