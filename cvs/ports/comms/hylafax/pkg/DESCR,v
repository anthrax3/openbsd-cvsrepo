@HylaFAX is an enterprise-class system for sending and receiving
facsimiles as well as for sending alpha-numeric pages.  The software is
designed around a client-server architecture.  Fax modems may reside on
a single machine on a network and clients can submit an outbound job
from any other machine on the network.  Client software is designed to
be lightweight and easy to port.

HylaFAX is designed to be very robust and reliable.  The fax server is
designed to guard against unexpected failures in the software, in the
configuration, in the hardware and in general use.  HylaFAX can support
multiple modems and a heavy traffic load.

If you expect to send more than a few facsimiles a day, then HylaFAX is
the fax package for you!!

     HylaFAX is a facsimile system for UNIX systems. It supports:
        o sending facsimile
        o receiving facsimile
        o polled retrieval of facsimile
        o transparent shared data use of the modem
        o sending messages to pagers
     Facsimile can be any size (e.g. A4, B4), either 98 or 196 lpi, and
     transmitted/received as either 1D-encoded or 2D-encoded facsimile data
     (2D-encoded data is frequently more compact and hence takes a shorter
     time to communicate). Any modem that supports one of the standard
     interfaces for facsimile operation can be used; i.e. any Class 1, Class
     2, or Class 2.0 modem.
