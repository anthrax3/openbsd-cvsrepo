@CHIRP is a free, open-source tool for programming amateur radios.
It supports a large number of manufacturers and models, as well as
provides a way to interface with multiple data sources and formats.

CHIRP's focus is to support reading and writing the memory channels
of as many radio models as possible. This provides the ability to
exchange your programming information between dissimilar radios.
It does not focus on supporting every single knob and setting that
each radio supports.
