@Tsung is a distributed load testing tool that is available free of
charge as an open source software product. It is protocol-independent
and can be used to stress Jabber/XMPP, HTTP, SOAP, LDAP and PostgreSQL
servers. The tool can simulate very large numbers of users per server,
making it ideal for analysing and testing the performance of large-scale
applications, such as instant messaging solutions.
