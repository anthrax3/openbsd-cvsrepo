@affinity/nfs locks don't really deal with packages not built
because of missing depends.  Keep in mind that build_path_list has
to be extensive to avoid LISTING errors...

So, if we meet a stub there, we should do our best to avoid it.
Some of these checks are probably slightly overkill.

@The "Engine" code is quite daunting, but in reality there are 3 things in
there.

Finally split them for less confusing files.
