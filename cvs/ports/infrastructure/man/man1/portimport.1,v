.Dt PORTIMPORT 1
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm portimport
.Nd import a new port to the ports cvs repository
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl p Ar portsdir
.Op Fl u Ar username
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is used to import the directories and files of a new port to the
.Ox
ports
.Xr cvs 1
repository, avoiding common mistakes.
It has to be executed from within the new port's directory.
.Pp
.Nm
calls the
.Xr portcheck 1
internally to verify that directory and file structure for a port is in
place and that no bogus files exist, and also to detect the
.Ev PKGPATH
for a port.
.Pp
The import is done in two steps.
In the first step, the
.Fl n
option of the cvs command is used to only check for possible problems
without changing anything and shows the cvs path where the new port will
be imported.
In the second step, the current ports directory is imported to the
.Ox
ports cvs repository.
After the import, the new port is checked out in the respective directory
of the local ports tree.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl p Ar portsdir
Forces the given directory to be treated as ports root directory.
Passed through to
.Xr portcheck 1 .
.It Fl u Ar username
Set the username used for
.Xr ssh 1 ,
and to compose vendor and release tags.
Defaults to the local username.
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr cvs 1 ,
.Xr portcheck 1
.Sh HISTORY
This command is based on the portimport script of Marc Espie, lightly
modified by Stuart Henderson and rewritten by Robert Peichaer.
Later, actual checks were moved to a separate utility,
.Xr portcheck 1 .
.Sh CAVEATS
The
.Ev CVSROOT
environment variable is not used.

1.4
log
@Face the reality: portcheck(1) is heavily used now, and not only for new
ports. Given that you import port once but update it a few times, make
the update mode (-CU) default for portcheck, and provide a "new port"
switch (-N) instead.

This commit updates portcheck(1) and portimport(1): code, documentation and
tests. The WWW stuff will be updated separately.

Note: regression suite fails now as it detected an actual misconsistence
in portcheck's output. This will be handled ASAP, too.

1.3
log
@Now that we have portcheck(1), start relying on it instead of doing
the checks and pkgpath detection ourself in portimport(1).

Sitting on this diff since september, reminded by kirby@@.

Tested in the wild by importing many ports, mostly KDE4-related.

The login name of the current user is used for the
.Xr ssh 1
connection to the
.Ox
cvs server, to compose the vendortag and the releasetag.
The value of the
.Va user
variable has to be changed in the sourcecode if a different login name is
used to connect to the cvs server.
