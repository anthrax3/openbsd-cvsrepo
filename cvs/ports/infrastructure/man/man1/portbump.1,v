.Dt PORTBUMP 1
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm portbump
.Nd tweaks port revisions and library versions
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl lMmnrv
.Op Fl W Ar wlib
.Op Fl w Ar wlib
.Op Ar portref ...
.Pp
.Nm
.Fl o Ar file
.Op Fl lMmnrv
.Op Fl W Ar addlib
.Op Fl w Ar rmlib
.Op Ar portref ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is used to increase ('bump')
.Ev REVISION
and
.Ev SHARED_LIBS
values in
.Ox
ports.
It also can remove
.Ev REVISION
marks and add, update or remove
.Ev WANTLIB
items.
.Pp
.Ar portref
has the same syntax as
.Ev FULLPKGPATH
port variable, see
.Xr bsd.port.mk 5 .
Actually, you can feed a list of pkgpaths as parameters; flavor
information will be ignored.
.Nm
doesn't care about actual subdirectory portion of
.Ar portref ,
so you can freely pass
.Pa \&. ,
.Pa ../foo
or anything else like this.
.Pp
If subpackage is not specified in port reference, then all subpackages
of a port will be processed.
If no port references are given, the port in current directory will
be processed.
.Pp
Default mode of operation is increasing
.Ev REVISION
mark values (
.Fl r ) .
Operations on
.Ev REVISION
marks and on
.Ev SHARED_LIBS
could be combined by explicit specifying corresponding flags, see below.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl d
Delete all
.Ev REVISION
marks in
.Pa Makefile .
Mutually exclusive with
.Fl r .
.It Fl l
Recreate all
.Ev WANTLIB
items based on output of
.Sq make port-lib-depends-check .
If used twice or more, the
.Sq make lib-depends-check
will be used instead.
The
.Fl l
mode is incompatible with
.Fl W
and
.Fl w .
.It Fl M
Increment by one major component of all
.Ev SHARED_LIBS ,
resetting minor one to zero if needed.
Mutually exclusive with
.Fl m .
.It Fl m
Increment by one minor component of all
.Ev SHARED_LIBS .
Mutually exclusive with
.Fl M .
.It Fl n
Do not replace
.Pa Makefile
but save modified version in the
.Pa Makefile.bump
instead.
.It Fl o Ar file
Send modified Makefile contents to a given file instead of creating
.Pa Makefile.bump
in port's directory.
This could be only used if not more than one port is specified;
multiple subpackages of a single port could be specified, though.
.It Fl r
Increment
.Ev REVISION
values for all subpackages, or only for given ones.
Mutually exclusive with
.Fl d .
.It Fl W Ar wlib
.It Fl w Ar wlib
Adds or updates (the
.Fl W
flag) or removes (the
.Fl w
flag)
.Ev WANTLIB
items in whole port, or in particular subpackages, if given.
Both options could be specified multiple times, accumulating
corresponding lists.
The
.Ev WANTLIB
entries will be fully re-generated based on previous contents.
Those modes are incompatible with
.Fl l .
.It Fl v
Enable printing of diagnostic messages to standard error output.

* use .Pa for paths

1.1
log
@Introduce portbump(1): one more tool in a Real Porter's collection.
Now, in conjuction with sqlports package, you can bump a bunch of ports
in a few minutes (including time for manual verification).

Idea supported and input given at different time by sthen@@, afresh1@@,
espie@@, ajacoutot@@ and others.

Tests to follow.

This is a default mode of operation, unless

The

flag could be combined explicitly with either of those two, though.
