@add sugar to have WANTLIB contain the right mix of
COMPILER_LIBCXX/LIBCXX/LIBECXX in most cases.

... and  future support for pthread variations.

.Sh NAME
.Nm check-lib-depends
.Nd scan port for shared libraries
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm check-lib-depends
.Op Fl fimoqx
.Op Fl B Ar destdir
.Op Fl d Ar pkgrepo
.Op Fl D Ar directory
.Op Fl F Ar missing
.Op Fl O Ar dest
.Op Fl S Ar VAR Ns = Ns Ar value
.Op Fl s Ar source
.Op Ar package ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
scans a port or package for shared libraries, and verify that all of them
are properly recorded.
.Pp
.Nm
can either scan files from a built port after the
.Ar fake stage
from the
.Ev WRKINST
directory, or look directly inside a
.Ar package .
.Pp
Likewise, it can also verify dependencies off installed packages,
or figure them out directly from the port directory.
.Pp
.Nm
actually consists of two distinct stages:
.Bl -bullet
.It
scan all binaries inside a package to extract libraries and rpaths,
using
.Xr objdump 1
or
.Xr ldd 1 .
.It
compare those libraries against the port's registered dependencies
and report problems.
.El
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width keyword
.It Fl B Ar destdir
Scan files under
.Ar destdir .
.It Fl d Ar pkgrepo
Look for all needed packages under directory
.Ar pkgrepo .
.It Fl D Ar directory
Create debug log files under
.Ar directory
that show in more details the run of
.Xr objdump 1 .
.It Fl f
Give full reports of every file that requires a missing library.
.It Fl F Ar missing
Works in tandem with
.Fl S .
Allow backsubstituting even if the
.Ar missing
library
is actually not part of the actual
.Ev WANTLIB
of the package.
Mostly used to waive the presence of
.Ar pthread ,
a mandatory dependency of C++ libraries on some architectures.
.It Fl i
Read packing-list from standard input.
.It Fl m
Always show progress-meter, even if not run from terminal.
.It Fl o
Scan binaries using
.Xr ldd 1 ,
which also works for old a.out binaries, instead of
.Xr objdump 1 ,
which only works for
.Xr elf 5
binaries.
.It Fl O Ar dest
Save result of first stage in file
.Ar dest .
.It Fl q
Be quiet, do not emit
.Sq Extra:
wantlibs unless there's also an actual problem.
.It Fl S Ar var Ns = Ns Ar value
recognize list of libraries listed in a variable, and replace said list
with variable value.
For instance,
.Fl S Ar COMPILER_LIBCXX Ns = Ns Ar stdc++
will replace
.Sq stdc++
with
.Sq ${COMPILER_LIBCXX}
in
.Ev WANTLIB
lists for compatibility with both clang and gcc.
Order matters.
The first
.Fl S
option will be handled first.
.It Fl s Ar src
Don't scan, directly read result of first stage from file
.Ar src .
.It Fl x
Don't show progress-meter, even if run from terminal.
.El
.Pp
If no
.Ar package
is given, and the
.Fl i
option is used,
.Nm
will retrieve the packing-list from stdin, and scan the package according
to other options.
