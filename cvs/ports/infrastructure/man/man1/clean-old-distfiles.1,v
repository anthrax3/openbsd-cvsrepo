.Sh NAME
.Nm clean-old-distfiles
.Nd remove old distfiles
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm clean-old-distfiles
.Op Fl nv
.Op Fl e Ar except
.Op Fl h Ar history
.Op Ar timestamp
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
uses information provided by
.Xr dpb 1
to remove obsolete distfiles:
each time
.Xr dpb 1
is run for a full scan of the ports tree, it appends to
an history log that records obsolete distfiles.
.Pp
.Nm
can be used to prune that log prior to a given
.Ar timestamp
and remove the corresponding distfiles.
.Pp
For normal files,
.Nm
verifies
.Xr sha256 1
checksums prior to removal.
.Nm
also removes links under
.Pa by_cipher/sha256 ,
but it trusts that the checksums for these are accurate.
.Pp
The
.Ar timestamp
optional argument is given in seconds since the epoch,
see
.Xr date 1 .
.Pp
Options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width nnnn
.It Fl e Ar except
Read exception list from file
.Ar except .
Each line is the name of a file that shouldn't be removed.
.It Fl h Ar history
Read log from history file
.Ar history
instead of the default
.Pa /usr/ports/distfiles/history .
Turns on
.Fl nv ,
as this is a testing option.
.It Fl n
Don't really remove files.
.It Fl v
Display what will be removed, as
.Li rm file
lines.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /usr/ports
.It Pa /usr/ports
base of the ports tree, can be overridden with env variable
.Ev PORTSDIR .
.It Pa /usr/ports/distfiles
location of the distfiles repository, can be overridden with env variable
.Ev DISTDIR .
.It Pa /usr/ports/distfiles/history
log of obsolete distfiles.
