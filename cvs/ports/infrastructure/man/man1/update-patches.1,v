.Sh NAME
.Nm update-patches
.Nd create or update patches for a given port.
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm update-patches
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a helper script for the target
.Ar update-patches
in
.Xr bsd.port.mk 5 .
It takes no argument, but uses quite a few environment variables as
implicit parameters.
.Pp
.Nm
looks under
.Ev WRKDIST
for patched files.
Those are files with extension
.Ev PATCHORIG ,
except for those matching also
.Ev DISTORIG .
.Pp
Once those files are found, they are matched against the contents of
directory
.Ev PATCHDIR ,
most specifically files matching wildcard
.Ev PATCH_LIST .
Matching files are regenerated using
.Pp
.Dl $ diff -u -p -a ${DIFF_ARGS} $file$PATCHORIG $file
.Pp
and compared.
Modified patches are updated and reported, new patches are generated,
and old patches that no longer seem to exist are also reported.
.Pp
.Nm
patches with problematic
.Xr cvs 1
keywords are also reported.
.Pp
.Nm
prints the list of changed patches for further study.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr cvs 1 ,
