.Sh NAME
.Nm resolve-lib
.Nd resolve library specs during ports build
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm resolve-lib
.Op Fl needed
.Op Fl silent
.Ar spec ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
resolve library specs against a list of installed libraries.
.Nm
takes a list of file names with full path on stdin,
and matches each library
.Ar spec
against those libraries,
using
.Xr library-specs 7
conventions.
.Pp
In particular,
.Ev X11BASE
and
.Ev LOCALBASE
are used to locate X11 libraries and port libraries.
.Pp
.Nm
will print the best libraries found in a format suitable for
.Cm @@wantlib
.Po
see
.Xr pkg_create 1
.Pc .
.Pp
Each
.Ar spec
not found will result in an error message and exit code.
.Pp
If the option
.Fl silent
is used, nothing will be displayed.
.Pp
The option
.Fl needed
is used to sort out
.Ev LIB_DEPENDS :
.Nm
will succeed if at least one of the libraries matches against a shared
library passed on the command line.
