@You control a gnome, who can walk around a garden, along paths already
marked, or create new paths wherever you wish. You also have a ball,
which can be thrown in the direction you're facing, towards the gnome's
feet. Points are scored for collecting cherries, killing monsters and
collecting the prize left when all the monsters have come out of their den.
