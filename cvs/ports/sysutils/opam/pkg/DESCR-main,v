@update to opam-1.2.2

Because the Aspcud constraint solver is not ported to OpenBSD yet, this
package is configured to use the IRILL online solver by default.  To
disable this and use the internal solver, set the "OPAMNOASPCUD" env
variable to "1".  You will need to do this if you want to use OPAM
when offline.

@OPAM is a source-based package manager for OCaml. It supports multiple
simultaneous compiler installations, flexible package constraints, and a
Git-friendly development workflow.

This package contains only the OPAM CLI tools.
