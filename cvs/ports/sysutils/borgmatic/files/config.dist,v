@import borgmatic-1.0.3

borgmatic is a simple Python wrapper script for the Borg backup software
that initiates a backup, prunes any old backups according to a retention
policy, and validates backups for consistency. The script supports
specifying your settings in a declarative configuration file rather than
having to put them all on the command-line, and handles common errors.
