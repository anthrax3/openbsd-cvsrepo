@Import ports/sysutils/backdir. Tweaks/suggestions sthen@@. ok sthen@@.

Backdir is a simple tool that backs up every normal, non-executable file
in the current directory to a subdirectory named "backups", creating the
directory if it doesn't already exist. It uses the file's last modified
date and time as part of the filename. If a file hasn't been changed
since the last time backdir was ran the file will be skipped.
