@Native implementation of facter functionality in C++11, providing:

  - a shared library which gather facts about the system
  - an executable for standalone command line usage
  - a ruby file to enable require 'facter'

Facter is especially useful for retrieving things like operating system
names, hardware characteristics, IP addresses, MAC addresses, and SSH
keys.

@import facter-3.0.1

Native implementation of facter functionality in C++11, providing:
  - a shared library which gather facts about the system
  - an executable for standalone command line usage
  - a ruby file to enable require 'facter'
Facter is especially useful for retrieving things like operating system
names, hardware characteristics, IP addresses, MAC addresses, and SSH
keys.

Note that this port doesn't provide all the facts that sysutils/ruby-facter
does right now, but that's being worked on. therefore it's not used by
puppet yet.
