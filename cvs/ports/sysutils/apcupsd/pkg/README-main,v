Special notice for APC USB devices
----------------------------------

Some APC USB devices are reported to only work with apcupsd if the
device is attached to ugen(4). Normally these devices attach to upd(4)
to provide system power sensors (see "sysctl hw.sensors"). If you are
having problems using such a device with NUT, you may need to prevent
this attachment.

The option with fewest side-effects is to add the following entries to
the table in /sys/dev/usb/usb_quirks.c and build a new kernel:

{ USB_VENDOR_APC, USB_PRODUCT_APC_UPS, ANY, { UQ_BAD_HID }},
{ USB_VENDOR_APC, USB_PRODUCT_APC_UPS5G, ANY, { UQ_BAD_HID }},

Alternatively, if you do not use a USB keyboard/mouse, you could simply
disable the upd and uhidev drivers. The following line creates a new kernel
with the relevant changes:

  printf 'disable uhidev\ndisable upd\nquit\n' | config -e -o /bsd.no-uhid /bsd

@Add a note that some USB devices need ugen to work.
The same note was added to sysutils/nut.

To allow the system to be fully powered down (in order to preserve
UPS battery), add the following lines to /etc/rc.shutdown:
d10 17
a26 10
if [ -f ${SYSCONFDIR}/powerfail ]; then
  echo
  echo "APCUPSD requested this system is powered down."
  echo
  powerdown=YES
  echo
  echo "Please ensure that the UPS has powered off before rebooting."
  echo "Otherwise, the UPS may cut the power during the reboot!!!"
  echo
