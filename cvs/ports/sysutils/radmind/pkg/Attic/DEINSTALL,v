@Initial import of radmind 1.3.0

A suite of Unix command-line tools and a server designed to remotely 
administer the file systems of multiple Unix machines.

At its core, radmind operates as a tripwire. It is able to detect 
changes to any managed filesystem object, e.g. files, directories, 
links, etc. However, radmind goes further than just integrity 
checking: once a change is detected, radmind can optionally reverse 
the change.
