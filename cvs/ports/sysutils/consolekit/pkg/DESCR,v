@Move to the ConsoleKit2 project and update to the newly released stable version:
consolekit2-1.0.0.
Committing early in the cycle to have time to catch any regression.

@What is ConsoleKit2?
===================
ConsoleKit2 is a framework for defining and tracking users, login sessions, and
seats. It allows multiple users to be logged in at the same time and share
hardware for their graphical session. ConsoleKit2 will keep track of those
resources and whichever session is active will have use of the hardware at that
time.

What is a seat?
===============
A seat is a collection of sessions and a set of hardware (usually at least a
keyboard and mouse).  Only one session may be active on a seat at a time.

What is a session?
==================
A session is a collection of all processes that originate from a single common
ancestor and retain knowledge of a secret.  As an implementation detail, this
secret may be stored in the process environment by the login manager under the
name XDG_SESSION_COOKIE.

ConsoleKit is a framework for defining and tracking users, login
sessions, and seats.  The primary motivations for this framework are to
facilitate fast-user-switching and multi-seat capabilities, and to
enable more sophisticated policy decisions for desktop sessions.

this is not hooked up to the build just yet, just like policykit
