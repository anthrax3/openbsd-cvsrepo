@MESSAGE -> README.

@To enable ConsoleKit in a graphical session, prepend ck-launch-session
to the session script (note: gdm(1) does this automatically). e.g.
    ${PREFIX}/bin/ck-launch-session ${PREFIX}/bin/openbox-session

Note that you need a system-wide DBus daemon running.
The /var/log/ConsoleKit/history logfile can grow very large after some
time. It is advised to use newsyslog(8) to rotate it.

@Some tweaks and remove BROKEN.

*** While basic functionnality works, this is NOT hooked up yet as more
things are coming and there is still a glib2/pthread bug preventing a
console to be detected as active.
