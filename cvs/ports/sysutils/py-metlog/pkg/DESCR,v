@metlog-py is a Python client for the "Metlog" system of application
logging and metrics gathering developed by the Mozilla Services team.
The Metlog system is meant to make life easier for application
developers with regard to generating and sending logging and analytics
data to various destinations. It achieves this goal (we hope!) by
separating the concerns of message generation from those of message
delivery and analysis. Front end application code no longer has to deal
directly with separate back end client libraries, or even know what back
end data storage and processing tools are in use. Instead, a message is
labeled with a type (and possibly other metadata) and handed to the
Metlog system, which then handles ultimate message delivery.
