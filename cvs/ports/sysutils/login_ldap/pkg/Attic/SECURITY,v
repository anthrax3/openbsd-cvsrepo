@revert wrong login_ldap commit which broke a number of rules; port may
be resurrected later when/if issues are worked out

Two things to note here:

1) This program should be suid root to ensure proper operation. The reason 
for this is given in the login.conf(5) manpage:

     An authentication program must not assume it will be called as root, nor
     must it assume it will not be called as root.  If it needs special per-
     missions to access files it should be setuid or setgid to the appropriate
     user/group.  See chmod(1).

   You can try and remove the setuid bit. It may work without it, it may not.

   Every effort has been made to ensure this software is bug free. 

2) This program will "break out" of the ports tree. It has to be in 
   /usr/libexec/auth for it to be noticed/found by the auth_subr(3) functions.
   When/If you remove this port you will have to run 

   rm /usr/libexec/auth/login_-ldap

   as root.
