@Direvent is a directory content watcher daemon, i.e. a program that monitors a
set of directories on the file system and reacts when their content changes.
When a change is detected, the daemon reacts by invoking an external command
configured for that kind of change.

The program aims to provide a uniform and system-independent command-level
interface for file system events.  This version is known to work on GNU/Linux
and BSD systems.
