@import of gkrellm 2.1.21 and associated plugins

besides bringing gkrellm and the plugins up2date, this introduces a new
port structure, where all plugins are located in sysutils/gkrellm/plugins.

the set of plugins consists of:
aclock, bgchg, flynn, itime, kam, launch, mailwatch, mms, moon, mss, reminder
shoot, stock, sun, volume, weather and wireless

ports done and maintained by Peter Hessler <spambox@@theapt.org>

all prior maintainers either agreed to him taking over their plugins or
timed out.
