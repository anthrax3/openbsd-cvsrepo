If you are upgrading from rancid-<3, please note that router.db field
separator has been changed from ':' to ';' to avoid conflict with IPv6
addresses. Replace the field separator in router.db files before running
rancid.

The configuration files location is changed from /etc to /etc/rancid.

configuration, including software and hardware (cards, serial numbers,
etc) and uses CVS (Concurrent Version System) to maintain history of 
changes.
