@Adjust the "meta" rc-scripts (these are used in ports with multiple daemons
which should all be started/stopped together), previously "restart" would
restart each sub-daemon in turn, but actually it should stop all daemons
and only then start them again. Additionally, as suggested by ajacoutot,
stop the procedure and return an error if stopping one of the rc scripts
failed.  ok ajacoutot@@ rpe@@

@Make all meta rc.d scripts consistent.
While here, unbreak when options are passed (e.g. /etc/rc.d/foobar -df start)

log
@Update to cfengine 3.4.4, worked on by okan@@, Jiri B, myself and
Martijn Rijkeboer (Martijn takes MAINTAINER), testing and src/sysinfo.c
diff from Timo Myyra.

!!! Note: CFEngine 3 is not a drop-in upgrade for CFEngine 2 installations.
!!! It is a significantly more powerful version, but it is incompatible with
!!! the CFEngine 2 policy language.
