1.1
log
@Update to cfengine 3.4.4, worked on by okan@@, Jiri B, myself and
Martijn Rijkeboer (Martijn takes MAINTAINER), testing and src/sysinfo.c
diff from Timo Myyra.

!!! Note: CFEngine 3 is not a drop-in upgrade for CFEngine 2 installations.
!!! It is a significantly more powerful version, but it is incompatible with
!!! the CFEngine 2 policy language.
