1.1
log
@Update to collectd 5.5.0.

Enable aggregation, curl_json, fhcount, log_logstash, memcached,
threshold, write_log & write_riemann plugins.
Add dependencies on devel/libyajl for curl_json & log_logstash and
devel/protobuf-c for write_riemann.
Add a README explaining how to run the daemon as _collectd user in case
you dont need the dns and ping plugins (the only ones requiring root).
Lots of patches merged upstream.

From Pavel Korovin with small tweaks by me, tested here on ppc.

| Running ${FULLPKGNAME} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

By default, collectd runs as root. Root privileges are required for some
collectd plugins, namely dns and ping plugins.
For more information, please referer to:
${HOMEPAGE}wiki/index.php/Category:Plugins_requiring_privileges

If you do not use these plugins, it is recommended to run collectd daemon
with unpriviliged user account, _collectd. Adjust your configuration with
the following command:

	# rcctl set collectd user "_collectd"

If you had previously run collectd as root using the rrdtool plugin,
you should also change the ownership of /var/collectd to _collectd.

	# chown -R _collectd /var/collectd
