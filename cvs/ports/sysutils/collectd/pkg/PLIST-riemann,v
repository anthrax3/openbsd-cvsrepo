1.1
log
@Update to collectd 5.6.2.

- put the write_riemann plugin in its own subpackage, depending on
  riemann-c-client.
- disable protobuf-c detection/dependency, used by two plugins we dont
  enable (pinba and grpc)
- fix some WANTLIB
- the processes and tcpconns plugin still seem to be busted, calling
  kvm_openfiles with O_RDONLY|KVM_NO_FILES is apparently not enough.
Interestingly, swap plugin (using the same code) works ?

Based on a diff from Pavel Korovin for 5.6.1, thanks!
