@You will need to add

to /etc/rc.local in order to have runit start at boot.

The service directory has moved from /service to /var/service.

With this version the runsvctrl, runsvstat, svwaitdown, and svwaitup
programs no longer are being installed. The functionality of these
programs has been incorporated into the sv program.
Read ${PREFIX}/share/doc/runit/upgrade.html on update.

@Import runit 1.0.4; submitted by Lars Hansson <lars@@unet.net.ph>.

runit is a daemontools alike replacement for sysvinit and other init
schemes. runit runs on GNU/Linux, OpenBSD, FreeBSD, MacOSX, Solaris, and
can easily be adapted to other Unix operating systems.
