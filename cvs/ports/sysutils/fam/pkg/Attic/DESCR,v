@FAM, the File Alteration Monitor, provides an API which applications can
use to be notified when specific files or directories are changed.

Available flavor:
	kqueue - Build with support for imon emulation through kqueue

log
@- use polling by defaut and make use of kqueue a FLAVOR
this allows famd to run much more reliably, especially under KDE and
GNOME; if someone wants to fix the imon emulation through kqueue, be my
guest... meanwhile, I'd rather use stable software
- more typos fixes in man pages while here
