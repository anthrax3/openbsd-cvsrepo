@Remove toad, it requires kern.usermount -like functionality which is not
on the radar.

@Import toad-0.3.

toad(8) (Toad Opens All Devices) is a utility meant to be started from
the OpenBSD hotplugd(8) attach and detach scripts. It will try to mount
all partitions found on the device under /run/media/username/device.
Where username is the active user login name and device is the type of
the device: usb or cd, followed by its number (from 0 to 9).
This follows the udev hierarchy in Linux which allows interaction with
GLib/GIO's GUnixMount.

That means it interacts natively with file managers like Thunar and
Nautilus (where you can directly unmount/eject devices).

It comes with toadd(8), a small daemon that will detect the insertion of
a medium in the optical drives of the machine by periodically reading
their disklabel(8) (every 8 seconds) and call toad(8) with the attach or
detach argument respectively.

NOTE: this is somewhat still a WIP and a moving target for sure
