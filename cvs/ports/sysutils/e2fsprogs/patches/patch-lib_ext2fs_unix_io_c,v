log
@Update e2fsprogs to 1.42.7, and rename the library back to libuuid now
that ossp-uuid (devel/uuid) has been changed to use the alternative name
libossp-uuid as used on various other OS. When third party software
wants a uuid library, is is nearly always the one from e2fsprogs,
so let's avoid patching for the common case.

e2fsprogs has its own libcom_err (slightly different API to heimdal);
previously we installed this under an alternative name; in this update
I have changed to statically linking this instead as it is not used
externally. The et/com_err.h header is no longer installed to avoid
ports picking it up in preference to the proper heimdal header for
this library in kerberosV/com_err.h.

Fallout will be handled in the next couple of commits.

log
@Update to e2fsprogs-1.41.4 (supporting ext2/ext3/ext4 fs) :
- Remove MAINTAINERS as they agree not having time nor interest for it.
- Use install-libs target instead of manually installing some cherrypicked
headers - now all needed headers are installed in the right place.
- Install fsck and its manpage as fsck_ext2fs instead of the confusing pfsck.
- Install uuid.pc as e2fs-uuid.pc to avoid conflicts with devel/uuid.
- Patch most Makefiles to print full build commands instead of the
non-informative linux-kernel-like output.
- Patch some regress tests, more and more works fine now.

With feedback and tweaks from naddy@@ and pea@@
