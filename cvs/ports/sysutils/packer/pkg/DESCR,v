@Packer is a tool for building identical machine images for multiple platforms
from a single source configuration.

Packer is lightweight, runs on every major operating system, and is highly
performant, creating machine images for multiple platforms in parallel. Packer
comes out of the box with support for the following platforms:

* Amazon EC2 (AMI). Both EBS-backed and instance-store AMIs
* DigitalOcean
* Docker
* Google Compute Engine
* OpenStack
* Parallels
* QEMU. Both KVM and Xen images.
* VirtualBox
* VMware

Support for other platforms can be added via plugins.

The images that Packer creates can easily be turned into Vagrant boxes.
