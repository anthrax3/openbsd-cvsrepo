@The dvd+rw-tools package is used to master DVD media, both +RW/+R and
-R[W].  The principal burning utility is called growisofs.  Although
it may be possible to with some operating systems to put arbitrary
file systems on DVD+RW, it's probably not very practical, because
it is likely desirable to access the data on an arbitrary computer.
In other words, ISO9660 filesystems are most likely desired.  It may
also be desirable to add data now and then, but DVD+RW has no notion of
multiple sessions.  Growisofs provides a way to both lay down and
grow an ISO9660 file system on (as well as to burn an arbitrary pre-
mastered image to) all supported DVD media.  It should be explicitly
noted that growisofs is a front-end to mkisofs, i.e. invokes mkisofs
to perform the actual ISO9660 file system layout.
