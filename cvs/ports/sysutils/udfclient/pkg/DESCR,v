@UDFclient is a userland implementation of the UDF filesystem as defined
by the OSTA group. UDFclient is designed to be a study platform and a
run-up to a full read and write kernel level implementation.

UDFclient provides a user interface similar to ftp(1), but differs in
that it always fetches or writes directory structures recursively.
