@update to symon 2.87

- N.B. Packages are re-arranged. Previously we had symon-mon (client only),
symon-mux (mux only), and symon (both client + mux - i.e. the combination of
the two other packages). Now we just have two non-overlapping packages
symon+symux, as is normal for multi-packages in the tree.

pkg_add -u will handle renaming but not splitting, so if you used the
"combined" package you will need to "pkg_add symux" after this update.

@symon is a lightweight system monitor that measures cpu, memory, interface
and disk statistics every 5 seconds. This information is then spooled over
the network to symux (packaged separately) for further processing.

@- adapt io monitor to handle the new hw.disknames format (devname: or
devname:uid), problem reported by Anton Maksimenkov with a different diff.

- new-style lib_depends/wantlib

- let ports-standard DEBUG=xxx work as expected and produce binaries
with symbols

sm_io.c diff looks good to henning@@

symon is a lightweight system monitor that measures cpu, memory,
interface and disk statistics every 5 seconds. This information is
then spooled over "the network" to symux for further processing.

The port will yield 3 packages:
symon-mon: symon daemon and manual.
symon-mux: symux daemon, manual and rrd creation script.
symon:     all of the above rolled into a single package.

@Consistency: remove the 1, 2 or even 3 empty blank lines.
