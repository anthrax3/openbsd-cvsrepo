@update to symon 2.87

- N.B. Packages are re-arranged. Previously we had symon-mon (client only),
symon-mux (mux only), and symon (both client + mux - i.e. the combination of
the two other packages). Now we just have two non-overlapping packages
symon+symux, as is normal for multi-packages in the tree.

pkg_add -u will handle renaming but not splitting, so if you used the
"combined" package you will need to "pkg_add symux" after this update.
@
text
@symux is a data gatherer for symon, a lightweight system monitor that
measures cpu, memory, interface and disk statistics every 5 seconds and
records the results in RRD files.

A very simple sample perl client is included; the results can also be
graphed via "syweb" (packaged separately) or by any other method that can
work with RRD files.
