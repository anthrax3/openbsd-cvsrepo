@Supervisor is a client/server system that allows its users to monitor
and control a number of processes on UNIX-like operating systems.

It shares some of the same goals of programs like launchd, daemontools,
and runit. Unlike some of these programs, it is not meant to be run as a
substitute for init as "process id 1".  Instead it is meant to be used
to control processes related to a project or a customer, and is meant to
start like any other program at boot time.
