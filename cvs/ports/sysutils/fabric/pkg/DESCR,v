@Fabric is a Python library and command-line tool for streamlining the
use of SSH for application deployment or systems administration tasks.

It provides a basic suite of operations for executing local or remote shell
commands (normally or via sudo) and uploading/downloading files, as well as
auxiliary functionality such as prompting the running user for input, or
aborting execution.
