1.1
log
@Split ruby-puppet:
* move the current port to ruby-puppet/3
* add a new puppet-2.7.X port under ruby-puppet/2

This allows us to ship with 2 different versions of Puppet. Since the
Enterprise version is still running 2.7, we want to have a matching
client because running puppet3 against a puppet2 server is highly
discouraged and will mostly no work correctly.

1.1.2.1
log
@update puppet to 3.3.2

this allows OpenBSD 5.4 agents to work correctly again with a puppet master
unning -current. puppet 3.3 has a new reporting format as well as support
for ensure => latest for packages. now one can use the same manifest for
5.4 and -current again.

note: libshadow was not imported into 5.4 so managing user passwords won't
work on 5.4 still.

discussed with sthen@@
