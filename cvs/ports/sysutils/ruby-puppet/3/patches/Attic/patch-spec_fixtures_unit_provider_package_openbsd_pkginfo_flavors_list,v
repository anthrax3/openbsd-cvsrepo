1.2.2.1
log
@update puppet to 3.3.2

this allows OpenBSD 5.4 agents to work correctly again with a puppet master
unning -current. puppet 3.3 has a new reporting format as well as support
for ensure => latest for packages. now one can use the same manifest for
5.4 and -current again.

note: libshadow was not imported into 5.4 so managing user passwords won't
work on 5.4 still.

discussed with sthen@@
