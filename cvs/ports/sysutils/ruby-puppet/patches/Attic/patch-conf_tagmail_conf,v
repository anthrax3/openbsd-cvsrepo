1.2
log
@Split ruby-puppet:
* move the current port to ruby-puppet/3
* add a new puppet-2.7.X port under ruby-puppet/2

This allows us to ship with 2 different versions of Puppet. Since the
Enterprise version is still running 2.7, we want to have a matching
client because running puppet3 against a puppet2 server is highly
discouraged and will mostly no work correctly.

+# This file configures the `tagmail` report, which can be enabled by including
+# tagmail in the puppet master's `reports` setting. (`reports = https, tagmail`)
+
+# Each line in this file should consist of a comma-separated list of tags and/or
+# negated tags (`!tag`), a colon, and a comma-separated list of email addresses.
+# The `all` psuedo-tag will email all log events.
+# See http://docs.puppetlabs.com/guides/configuring.html#tagmailconf for
+# a complete description of this file.
+
+# Example:
+
+# all: log-archive@@example.com
+# webserver, !mailserver: httpadmins@@example.com
+# emerg, crit: james@@example.com, zach@@example.com, ben@@example.com

1.1
log
@Sanitize this package and provide a working runtime out of the box:
* remove USE_GROFF to prevent warnings
* fix the examples directory
* use .conf files from upcoming 3.1 version (they work by default and the patches can be easily removed when we upgrade)
* add a default minimal puppet.conf that works instead of the currently broken one we ship
* only include conf files we need
* no need to create the hierarchy under /var/puppet since puppet will take care of it
