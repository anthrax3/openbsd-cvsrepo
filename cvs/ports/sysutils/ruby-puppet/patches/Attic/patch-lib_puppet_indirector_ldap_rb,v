log
@Split ruby-puppet:
* move the current port to ruby-puppet/3
* add a new puppet-2.7.X port under ruby-puppet/2

This allows us to ship with 2 different versions of Puppet. Since the
Enterprise version is still running 2.7, we want to have a matching
client because running puppet3 against a puppet2 server is highly
discouraged and will mostly no work correctly.

@Update to 2.6.3rc and fix a file locking issue while using LDAP.
Also add a patch for the LDAP connections to make puppet retry
instead of just erroring out.
