1.2
log
@Sanitize this package and provide a working runtime out of the box:
* remove USE_GROFF to prevent warnings
* fix the examples directory
* use .conf files from upcoming 3.1 version (they work by default and the patches can be easily removed when we upgrade)
* add a default minimal puppet.conf that works instead of the currently broken one we ship
* only include conf files we need
* no need to create the hierarchy under /var/puppet since puppet will take care of it
