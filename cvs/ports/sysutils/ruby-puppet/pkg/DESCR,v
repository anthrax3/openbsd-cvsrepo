@Factorize a bit more since both ports version share a lot.
While here, fix the rc script to start the master instead of the client
and vice-versa.

@Puppet lets you centrally manage every important aspect of your system using
a cross-platform specification language that manages all the separate
elements normally aggregated in different files, like users, cron jobs,
and hosts, along with obviously discrete elements like packages, services,
and files.
Puppet's simple declarative specification language provides powerful classing
abilities for drawing out the similarities between hosts while allowing them
to be as specific as necessary, and it handles dependency and prerequisite
relationships between objects clearly and explicitly.
Puppet is written entirely in Ruby.

log
@Split ruby-puppet:
* move the current port to ruby-puppet/3
* add a new puppet-2.7.X port under ruby-puppet/2

This allows us to ship with 2 different versions of Puppet. Since the
Enterprise version is still running 2.7, we want to have a matching
client because running puppet3 against a puppet2 server is highly
discouraged and will mostly no work correctly.
