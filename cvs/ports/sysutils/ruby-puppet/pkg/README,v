MCollective and ActiveMQ Integration
====================================

Here are some quick notes about using ActiveMQ as a middleware layer for
MCollective.

Packages
--------
All clients will need to have the "mcollective" package installed.
The STOMP broker package is called "apache-activemq" and can be
installed on the Puppet master.

MCollective configuration
-------------------------
Configuration is done in:
    ${SYSCONFDIR}/mcollective/client.cfg

The "activemq" connector should be enabled in this file. The "stomp"
connector has been deprecated in favor of "activemq" which has a lower
overhead and better network performance.

ActiveMQ configuration
----------------------
Setting up ActiveMQ can be tedious so it is recommended to start with
the single-broker example configuration from the Puppet Labs
documentation, as a starting point for configuring:
    ${SYSCONFDIR}/activemq/activemq.xml

More information is available in the Puppet Labs online documentation:
    http://docs.puppetlabs.com/mcollective/reference/plugins/connector_activemq.html
    http://docs.puppetlabs.com/mcollective/deploy/middleware/activemq.html
