log
@remove puppet-2.x, it was intended to be kept around to work against the PE
version, but OS interaction with PE has been broken for a long time now.
Besides, the next PE version will be based on Puppet 3.

log
@Split ruby-puppet:
* move the current port to ruby-puppet/3
* add a new puppet-2.7.X port under ruby-puppet/2

This allows us to ship with 2 different versions of Puppet. Since the
Enterprise version is still running 2.7, we want to have a matching
client because running puppet3 against a puppet2 server is highly
discouraged and will mostly no work correctly.
