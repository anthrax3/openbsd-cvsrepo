1.4
log
@remove puppet-2.x, it was intended to be kept around to work against the PE
version, but OS interaction with PE has been broken for a long time now.
Besides, the next PE version will be based on Puppet 3.

+# [extra_files]
+#   path /etc/puppet/files
+#   allow *
+#
+# In the example above, anything in /etc/puppet/files/<file name> would be
+# available to authenticated nodes at puppet:///extra_files/<file name>.
+#
+# Mount points may also use three placeholders as part of their path:
+#
+# %H - The node's certname.
+# %h - The portion of the node's certname before the first dot. (Usually the
+#      node's short hostname.)
+# %d - The portion of the node's certname after the first dot. (Usually the
+#      node's domain name.)
+
+# PERMISSIONS
+
+# Every static mount point should have an `allow *` line; setting more
+# granular permissions in this file is deprecated. Instead, you can
+# control file access in auth.conf by controlling the
+# /file_metadata/<mount point> and /file_content/<mount point> paths:
+#
+# path ~ ^/file_(metadata|content)/extra_files/
+# auth yes
+# allow /^(.+)\.example\.com$/
+# allow_ip 192.168.100.0/24
+#
+# If added to auth.conf BEFORE the "path /file" rule, the rule above
+# will add stricter restrictions to the extra_files mount point.

@Start services with '-f' since they may not be enabled in rc.conf.local(5).
Implement a restart command for the service provider and use '-f' as well.
No need to specify a 'stop' common, our rc.d(8) is generic enough.

1.1
log
@Split ruby-puppet:
* move the current port to ruby-puppet/3
* add a new puppet-2.7.X port under ruby-puppet/2

This allows us to ship with 2 different versions of Puppet. Since the
Enterprise version is still running 2.7, we want to have a matching
client because running puppet3 against a puppet2 server is highly
discouraged and will mostly no work correctly.
