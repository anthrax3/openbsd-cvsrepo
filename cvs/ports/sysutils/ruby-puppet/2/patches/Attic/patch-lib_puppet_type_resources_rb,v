1.2
log
@remove puppet-2.x, it was intended to be kept around to work against the PE
version, but OS interaction with PE has been broken for a long time now.
Besides, the next PE version will be based on Puppet 3.

@$OpenBSD: patch-lib_puppet_type_resources_rb,v 1.1 2013/04/16 13:25:52 jasper Exp $

User ID's below 1000 are considered "system users" on OpenBSD,
eventhough we lack the concept of "system users". Puppet uses
this to determine if a user can be purged.

1.1
log
@adjust the uid puppet looks at to determine if a user is a "system user" to 1000.
this then gets used to purge all non-system users, whether this is a good idea is
left as an exercise to the user.
