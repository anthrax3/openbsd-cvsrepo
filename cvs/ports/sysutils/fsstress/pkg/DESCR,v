@fix various typos, from Anthony J. Bentley with a few tweaks by myself

@fsstress is a small tool to beat up a filesystem performing lots of 
vfs operations in parallel. It is good for torturing nfs, or ensuring

they are already broken.

Lifted from dragonfly, originally written by sgi. Flensed of unnecessary
goo by Bob Beck.
