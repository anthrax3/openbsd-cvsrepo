@Sysmon is a network monitoring tool designed to provide high performance and
accurate network monitoring.

This tool is available in the public domain for anyone to use it that is
interested. It provides better performance and checking capabilities than other
tools such as Rover, Nocmon (not this: Nocmonitor), Whatsup, Big Brother, and
other such tools.

Configuration is simple and hierarchical, and can easily integrate email alerts.

Currently supported protocols include SMTP, IMAP, HTTP, TCP, UDP, NNTP, and
PING. Sysmon also provides a simple web output of monitored hosts.
