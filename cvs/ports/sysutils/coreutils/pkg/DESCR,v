@The GNU Core Utilities are the basic file, shell and text manipulation
utilities of the GNU operating system.

Previously these utilities were offered as three individual sets of GNU
utilities, Fileutils, Shellutils, and Textutils. Those three have been
combined into a single set of utilities called Coreutils.

All the binaries are prefixed by the letter g to differentiate them with
the standard applications with the same name. The texinfo
documentation will refer to them without the 'g' prefix. `id' is
prefixed by two g (ggid) in other to avoid a conflict with gid in
id-utils.
