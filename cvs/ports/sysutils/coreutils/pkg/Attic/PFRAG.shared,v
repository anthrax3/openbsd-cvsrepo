log
@Fix handling of gstdbuf and !shared archs.
- gstdbuf uses LD_PRELOAD with a fixed name "libstdbuf.so", so don't
  rename it to glibstdbuf.so
- this functionality requires shared libs support, which we don't have
  on vax.  Sadly the upstream test (is the platform ELF and is the compiler
  gcc?) isn't enough.  So hack the test and put gstdbuf-related files in
  PFRAG.shared.
