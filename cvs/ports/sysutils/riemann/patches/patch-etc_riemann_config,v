@Import riemann 0.2.12, from MAINTAINER Pavel Korovin /p/tristero/se

Riemann provides low-latency, transient shared state for systems with many
moving parts.
Riemann aggregates events from your servers and applications with a powerful
stream processing language. Send an email for every exception raised by your
code. Track the latency distribution of your web app. See the top processes
on any host, by memory and CPU. Combine statistics from every Riak node in
your cluster and forward to Graphite. Send alerts when a key process fails
to check in. Know how many users signed up right this second.
