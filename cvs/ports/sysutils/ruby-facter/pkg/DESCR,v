@Cross-platform Ruby library and program for retrieving facts about the
hardware and operating systems. Supports multiple resolution mechanisms,
any of which can be restricted to working only on certain operating
systems or environments. Facter is especially useful for retrieving
things like operating system names, hardware characteristics, IP
addresses, MAC addresses, and SSH keys.
