@- split the netxml-ups driver into a separate package (nut-xml),
as was already done with the snmp-ups driver, to reduce dependencies
for the common case

- rewrite the various DESCR files
@
text
@This NUT driver allows you to monitor UPS devices via SNMP. It automatically
detects and supports a wide range of devices by loading various MIBS, including
various Eaton, MGE, APC, Liebert, Powerware and other devices.

Experimental driver for monitoring UPSs via SNMP.  Supports a wide 
range of devices by loading various MIBS, including:

       ietf:  UPS that is RFC 1628 (UPS MIB)  compliant,  ie  MGE
              UPS SYSTEMS, Liebert, perhaps others (default)

       mge:   MGE UPS SYSTEMS devices with SNMP cards (ref 66062,
              66045, 66074 and 66244)

       apcc:  APC AP9606 APC Web/SNMP  management  card,  perhaps
              others

1.1
log
@More PLIST updates... clean up the Makefile a bit and add an optional
-snmp SUBPACKAGE.

Also, remove myself as MAINTAINER.  Not that I won't continue to support
it, just that my shinny new(?) SNMP card for my UPS makes this port
not one I'll use everyday anymore.

See what happens when people give me free stuff :).
