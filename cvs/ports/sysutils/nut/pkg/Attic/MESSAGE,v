@More PLIST updates... clean up the Makefile a bit and add an optional
-snmp SUBPACKAGE.

Also, remove myself as MAINTAINER.  Not that I won't continue to support
it, just that my shinny new(?) SNMP card for my UPS makes this port
not one I'll use everyday anymore.

See what happens when people give me free stuff :).

@Update to 1.4.1.

In addition to the standard bugfixes, this is a major port rewrite.
The port now uses a '_ups' user and the CGIs created can now run under
either chrooted Apache or non-chrooted Apache.
