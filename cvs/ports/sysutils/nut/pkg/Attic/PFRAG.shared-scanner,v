1.2
log
@update to NUT 2.6.3.

- nut-scanner has been changed to dlopen()ing modules, so roll it into the
main package now this can be done without bringing in excess dependencies.

1.1
log
@- Handle the libusb-compat changeover, from aja@@

- Move nut-scanner to a separate package, not everybody wants to
 scan their nuts and it pulls in various deps not wanted for the
 main package.

- Add missing dep on avahi (for the scanner only) and install
 static service configuration files.
