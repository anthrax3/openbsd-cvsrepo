@- split the netxml-ups driver into a separate package (nut-xml),
as was already done with the snmp-ups driver, to reduce dependencies
for the common case

- rewrite the various DESCR files

@Network UPS Tools is a collection of programs which provide a common
interface for monitoring and administering Uninterruptible Power
Supply (UPS), Power Distribution Unit (PDU), and Solar Controller
Device (SCD) hardware. It uses a layered approach to connect all
of the parts.

Drivers are provided for a wide assortment of equipment. They
understand the specific language of each device and map it back to
a compatibility layer. This means both an expensive high end UPS,
a simple "power strip" PDU, or any other power device can be handled
transparently with a uniform management interface.

This information is cached by the network server upsd, which then
answers queries from the clients. upsd contains a number of access
control features to limit the abilities of the clients. Only
authorized hosts may monitor or control your hardware if you wish.
Since the notion of monitoring over the network is built into the
software, you can hang many systems off one large UPS, and they
will all shut down together. You can also use NUT to power on, off
or cycle your data center nodes, individually or globally through
PDU outlets.

Network UPS Tools is a suite of programs that can be used to monitor
the status of an Uninterruptible Power Supply.  Nut tries to support
"every kind of UPS with sufficient interest behind it."  Most decent
UPSs have a serial port for access to status information.  The primary
use of Nut is to notify the machine in the event of a power failure so
that scripts may be run to properly shutdown your machine.  Nut also
has a network communications layer that allows other machines to
coordinate shutdowns with the machine that is physically attached to
the UPS.
