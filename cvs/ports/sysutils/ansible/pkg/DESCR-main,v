@Ansible is a radically simple, SSH-based, model-driven, configuration
management, deployment, and ad-hoc task execution framework. Some
core areas of focus include multi-node deployment, rolling updates,
and parallel orchestration.

This package contains Ansible HTML documentation, also available
online at http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/
