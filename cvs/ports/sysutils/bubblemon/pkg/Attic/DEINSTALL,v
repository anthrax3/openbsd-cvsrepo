log
@* Use variables instead of hardcoded prefixes.
* Take care to set a sane PATH.
* Add set -e
* Copy example files into ${PREFIX}/share/examples/PORTNAME.
* Replace PKGNAME with P_NAME in INSTALL/DEINSTALL scripts, unclear
  since it already exists in the Makefile with a different value.
* Change output of INSTALL/DEINSTALL to be more like other scripts
  found in the tree(suggested by heko@@).
