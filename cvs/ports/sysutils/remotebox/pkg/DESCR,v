@RemoteBox is a VirtualBox client. In essence, you can remotely
administer (ie over the network) an installation of VirtualBox on a
server, including its guests and interact with them as if they were
running locally. VirtualBox is installed on 'the server' machine and
RemoteBox runs on 'the client' machine. RemoteBox provides a complete
GTK graphical interface with a look and feel very similar to that of
VirtualBox's native GUI. If you're familiar with other virtualization
software, such as VMWare ESX, then think of RemoteBox as the
"poor man's" VI client.
