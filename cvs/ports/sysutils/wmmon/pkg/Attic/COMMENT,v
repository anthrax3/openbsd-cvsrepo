1.2
log
@1. Integrate COMMENT, new NEED_VERSION
2. General cleanup in wmmon/wmmon.c
3. If you have root privs and exit, you'll get "Broken pipe". This occurs
upon execution of XCloseDisplay() (which followed by exit(0)). Handle it
with signal(SIGPIPE, exit).

@Initial import of wmmon-1.0b2.

WMMon monitors the realtime CPU load as well the average
system load and gives you some nice additional features too.
