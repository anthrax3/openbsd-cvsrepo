log
@1. Integrate COMMENT, new NEED_VERSION
2. General cleanup in wmmon/wmmon.c
3. If you have root privs and exit, you'll get "Broken pipe". This occurs
upon execution of XCloseDisplay() (which followed by exit(0)). Handle it
with signal(SIGPIPE, exit).

@WMMon monitors the realtime CPU load as well the average
system load and gives you some nice additional features too...

WMMon currently provides:

* Realtime CPU 'stress' meter;
* Average systemload, like xload & wmavgload (autoscaling);
* Realtime Disk I/O 'stress' meter;
* Average Disk I/O load graphic (autoscaling);
* Realtime total Mem & Swap usage meters;
* System uptime display;
* Realtime cycling through all monitor modes;
* Can be started multiple times;
* Commandline options for help (-h), version (-v),
  start mode (-i & -s) and display (-d);

WMMon can launch 3 user definable commands for left, middle and
right mouse button clicks, which you can define in ~/.wmmonrc:

left: mycommand-1 &
middle: mycommand-2 &
right: mycommand-3 &
