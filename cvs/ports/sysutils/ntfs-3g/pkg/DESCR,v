@Import ntfs-3g (2013.1.13)

NTFS-3G is a stable, full-featured, read-write NTFS driver for Linux,
Android, Mac OS X, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, OpenSolaris, QNX, Haiku,
and other operating systems. It provides safe handling of the
Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows 2000, Windows Vista,
Windows Server 2008 and Windows 7 NTFS file systems.


This still needs a few patches in libfuse that will be committed soon
and of course a kernel with FUSE enabled.

Until these issues are fixed the port won't be linked to the build.

Tested on amd64 on a 32G NTFS partition. Reads and writes seem to work
like a charm.
