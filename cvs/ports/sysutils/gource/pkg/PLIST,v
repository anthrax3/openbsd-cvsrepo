@import gource 0.37

Gource is an animated tree with the root directory of the project at its
centre. Directories appear as branches with files as leaves. Developers
can be seen working on the tree at the times they contributed to the
project.

Currently Gource includes built-in log generation support for Git,
Mercurial and Bazaar and SVN. Gource can also parse logs produced by
several third party tools for CVS repositories.
