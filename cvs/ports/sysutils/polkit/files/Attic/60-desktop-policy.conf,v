@Import polkit-0.97.

PolicyKit is an application-level toolkit for defining and handling the
policy that allows unprivileged processes to speak to privileged
processes. It is a framework for centralizing the decision making
process with respect to granting access to privileged operations for
unprivileged applications. PolicyKit is specifically targeting
applications in rich desktop environments on multi-user UNIX-like
operating systems. It does not imply or rely on any exotic kernel
features.


bsd_auth(3) support is based on the Slackware Linux shadow
authentication port.
Several patches from FreeBSD and NetBSD.

*While basic functionnality works, this is NOT hooked up yet as more
things are coming*
