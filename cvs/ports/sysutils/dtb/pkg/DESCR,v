log
@Add a port to build Device Tree Blobs (DTBs) for various
ARM/MIPS/PowerPC boards.  DTBs are binary representations of Flattened
Device Trees (FDTs) that describe hardware properties such as memory
ranges, interrupts and processors.

DTB files are used by U-Boot and other firmware interfaces to provide
this information to the kernel.
