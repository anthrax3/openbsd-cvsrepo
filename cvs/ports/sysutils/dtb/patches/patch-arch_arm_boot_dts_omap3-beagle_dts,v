1.1
log
@The armv7 fdt console selection tries to find /chosen/stdout-path and
falls back to /aliases/serial0.

Add patches to set stdout-path for dts files that don't set stdout-path
and are known to use a serial device other than serial0 as a console.

Confirmed to restore console output on pandaboard es by abieber@@
