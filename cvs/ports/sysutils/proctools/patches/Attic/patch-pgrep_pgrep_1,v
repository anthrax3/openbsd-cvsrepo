Submitted by James Devenish (j-devenish@@users.sourceforge.net)
Modified by danh@@

Proctools  provides  the  pgrep and pkill commands which can
scan for and send signals to processes that are  matched  by
command-line options.

The  pgrep  utility displays process IDs for those processes
that match the requirements specified on the command line.

The pkill utility sends a signal to process  IDs  for  those
processes  that match the requirements specified on the com-
mand line.
