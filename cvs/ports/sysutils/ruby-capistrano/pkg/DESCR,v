@Capistrano is a utility and framework for executing commands in parallel
on multiple remote machines, via SSH. It uses a simple DSL (borrowed in
part from Rake that allows you to define _tasks_), which may be applied
to machines in certain roles. It also supports tunneling connections via
some gateway machine to allow operations to be performed behind VPN's
and firewalls.

Capistrano was originally designed to simplify and automate deployment
of web applications to distributed environments, and originally came
bundled with a set of tasks designed for deploying Rails applications.
