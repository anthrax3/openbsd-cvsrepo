@Import SeaBIOS for use with vmm(4). done as a "firmware" port, so that
fw_update will be able to be modified to install it on suitable systems.
Based on SeaBIOS config/Makefile from mlarkin and a non-"firmware" port
from jca, looks good to jca deraadt.

@SeaBIOS image for use with vmm(4).

SeaBIOS is an open source implementation of a 16bit X86 BIOS. It can run
in an emulator or it can run natively on X86 hardware with the use of
coreboot.
