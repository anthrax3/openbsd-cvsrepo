log
@- change some sysutils/firmware/* PERMIT_* from Yes to "firmware" - these
shouldn't end up in normal package mirrors. add a check to Makefile.inc so
this doesn't get added to others.

- add an extra printed warning at the end of ulpt "fake" stage; as pointed
out by stsp after discussion with bentley@@ the license for this says "you
may not put the software onto any public network"
