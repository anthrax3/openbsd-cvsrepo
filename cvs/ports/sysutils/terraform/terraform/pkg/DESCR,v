@Update to terraform-0.10.0-beta1.

While this is a beta release, I'd rather get it in tree asap because upstream
split all providers into their own project. So now we have one terraform and
69 terraform-providers (for now). See this URL for details:
https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/upcoming-provider-changes-in-terraform-0-10/

If you miss a provider for your iac declaration you have the choice of
downloading hashicorp binaries over the net or better: installing the
corresponding OpenBSD package.
e.g.
pkg_add terraform-provider-aws
cd /path/to/where/foo.tf/is/stored
terraform init <- this will record the sha256 sum of the plugin

@Terraform is a tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely
and efficiently. Terraform can manage existing and popular service providers as
well as custom in-house solutions.

The key features of Terraform are:

- Infrastructure as Code: Infrastructure is described using a high-level
configuration syntax. This allows a blueprint of your datacenter to be versioned
and treated as you would any other code. Additionally, infrastructure can be
shared and re-used.

- Execution Plans: Terraform has a "planning" step where it generates an
execution plan. The execution plan shows what Terraform will do when you call
apply. This lets you avoid any surprises when Terraform manipulates
infrastructure.

- Resource Graph: Terraform builds a graph of all your resources, and
parallelizes the creation and modification of any non-dependent resources.
Because of this, Terraform builds infrastructure as efficiently as possible, and
operators get insight into dependencies in their infrastructure.

- Change Automation: Complex changesets can be applied to your infrastructure
with minimal human interaction. With the previously mentioned execution plan and
resource graph, you know exactly what Terraform will change and in what order,
avoiding many possible human errors.
