@Do not strip lang/go binaries in sysutils/logstash/forwarder

The Go compiler doesn't output all the expected segments and
upstream is officially against stripping Go binaries. It's also
known to cause crashesh and other runtime issues.

The warnings were initially spotted by Fritjof Bornebusch thanks!

@Refactor lang/go module

From port-modules(5):

     lang/go       Adds Go toolchain support.  Requires ALL_TARGET to be set
                   to canonical Go import path of port.  (Module sets it
                   automatically for ports that use GH_ACCOUNT and GH_PROJECT
                   macros.)

                   During execution of post-patch target module moves source
                   code from ${MODGO_SUBDIR} to ${WRKSRC}, subdirectory of
                   ${MODGO_WORKSPACE} - specially-crafted Go workspace located
                   at ${WRKDIR}/go.  During do-build module calls ``go
                   install'' with GOPATH set to ${MODGO_WORKSPACE}, runs its
                   output through sed to prevent writes outside WRKDIR sandbox
                   and sends output to sh(1).  During do-install it copies
                   executables from ${MODGO_WORKSPACE}/bin to ${PREFIX}/bin,
                   and/or directories ${MODGO_WORKSPACE}/pkg and
                   ${MODGO_WORKSPACE}/src to ${PREFIX}/go, depending on
                   MODGO_TYPE contents.

                   Sets BUILD_DEPENDS, RUN_DEPENDS, ALL_TARGET, TEST_TARGET,
                   ONLY_FOR_ARCHS, SEPARATE_BUILD, and WRKSRC.

                   Defines:

                   MODGO_TYPE       Type of port.  May be any combination of:

                                    bin  ordinary binary, which should be
                                         installed to ${PREFIX}/bin,

                                    lib  library, which should come with
                                         source code.

                                    Defaults to bin.

                   MODGO_WORKSPACE  Path to Go workspace set up for port build
                                    process.  Defaults to ${WRKDIR}/go.  See
                                    Go documentation for details.

                   MODGO_SUBDIR     Path to Go source code within port's
                                    sources tarball.  Defaults to ${WRKDIST}.

                   MODGO_SETUP_WORKSPACE
                                    Commands setting up Go workspace for
                                    building ports.  By default, happens
                                    during execution of post-patch target.

                   MODGO_BUILDDEP   Controls whether contents of
                                    MODGO_BUILD_DEPENDS are appended to port's
                                    BUILD_DEPENDS.  Defaults to Yes.

                   Additionally defines MODGO_PACKAGES, MODGO_SOURCES and
                   MODGO_TOOLS (paths for installed Go packages, sources and
                   tools respectively), MODGO_CMD and MODGO_FLAGS (source code
                   build command and flags passed as its arguments),
                   MODGO_BUILD_CMD and MODGO_TEST_CMD (commands for building
                   and testing go packages; normally called with canonical Go
                   package names as arguments),
                   MODGO_{BUILD,INSTALL,TEST}_TARGET and
                   MODGO_{BUILD,RUN}_DEPENDS.
