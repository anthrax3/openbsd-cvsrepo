1.1
log
@Completely rework the way this port is handled. Drop all FLAVORs and
move to MULTI_PACKAGEs (the no_bat PSEUDO_FLAVOR is still available).
This modifies the packages as:
bacula-client	- no change
bacula-server	- the server part, now unflavored and depends on a proper SQL package support
bacula-bat	- no change
bacula-mysql	- new, MySQL support for bacula-server
bacula-pgsql	- new, PostgreSQL support for bacula-server
bacula-sqlite3	- new, SQLite3 support for bacula-server

All SQL support packages conflict with each others.
For users of mysql and sqlite3, a manual step will be needed to properly
upgrade bacula-server; sthen@@ will take care of this in current.html.

Tested by myself and sthen@@
ok sthen@@
