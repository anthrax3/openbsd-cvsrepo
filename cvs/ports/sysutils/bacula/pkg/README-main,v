@Major update to Bacula 7.0.2.
Some info at:
http://blog.bacula.org/p710/
http://blog.bacula.org/release-7-0-2/

Now builds with our libtool(1).

While there's a huge amount of changes, existing setups "should" just
work without any modification.

tested by sthen@@ and myself
ok sthen@@, my new co-maintainer :-)
