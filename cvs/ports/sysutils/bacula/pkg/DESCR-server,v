@Completely rework the way this port is handled. Drop all FLAVORs and
move to MULTI_PACKAGEs (the no_bat PSEUDO_FLAVOR is still available).
This modifies the packages as:
bacula-client	- no change
bacula-server	- the server part, now unflavored and depends on a proper SQL package support
bacula-bat	- no change
bacula-mysql	- new, MySQL support for bacula-server
bacula-pgsql	- new, PostgreSQL support for bacula-server
bacula-sqlite3	- new, SQLite3 support for bacula-server

All SQL support packages conflict with each others.
For users of mysql and sqlite3, a manual step will be needed to properly
upgrade bacula-server; sthen@@ will take care of this in current.html.

Tested by myself and sthen@@

@Bacula comes by night and sucks the vital essence from your computers.

Bacula is a set of computer programs that permit you (or the system
administrator) to manage backup, recovery, and verification of computer
data across a network of computers of different kinds.  In technical
terms, it is a network Client/Server based backup program.  Bacula is
relatively easy to use and efficient, while offering many advanced
storage management features that make it easy to find and recover lost
or damaged files. Due to its modular design, Bacula is scalable from
small single computer systems to systems consisting of hundreds of
computers located over a large network.

bacula-server contains the bacula-sd "storage daemon" that writes the
backup data to the backup device.  bacula-dir is the "director" that
manages backups.  bconsole is the management application to control the
director and get status of file daemons and storage daemons.

@Update bacula to 2.2.8.

Bacula changelog:
http://bacula.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/bacula/branches/Branch-2.2/bacula/ChangeLog?revision=6309&view=markup

Major port change in this version:
-main subpackage is now bacula-client
-server subpackage remains bacula-server
-bat subpackage is new bacula admin tool
-client subpackage goes away.

If the old -main subpackage was installed, the upgrade path is to
install both bacula-client and bacula-server.

Lots of input and assistance from sthen and okan.
ok okan;  "if it works for you, go for it" sthen

Available flavors are:
	- sqlite: use the sqlite 2.x library as a storage engine.
	- sqlite3: use the sqlite 3.x library as a storage engine.
	  This is the default.
	- pgsql: use a postgresql server as a storage engine.
	- mysql: use a mysql server as a storage engine.
