@Major update to bacula 5.2.1.

As usual with major version bump, do not forget to run the upgrade
script corresponding to your DB.
A new README is provided in the package.

Tested by sthen@@ and myself.

@To take advantage of bacula's DVD/CD writing, install cdrtools and
dvd+rw-tools packages.

Backend database creation/update scripts are located in
${TRUEPREFIX}/libexec/bacula

Note: If upgrading from a version older than 5.0.0, a database upgrade
is necessary.  Also, Director and Storage Daemons must be upgraded at
the same time, but older File Daemons can be used with 5.0.x.

See http://bacula.org/5.0.x-manuals/en/main/main/index.html for Bacula
documentation.

@Update bacula to 5.0.2.

Fixes the weird install issues with the bat binary

New features can be found here:
http://www.bacula.org/5.0.x-manuals/en/main/main/New_Features_in_5_0_0.html

Thanks to sthen for help with the new wantlib/lib_depends stuff,
removing the sqlite flavor, ...

Thanks to giovanni for pointing out a ${TRUEPREFIX} -> /usr/local that
crept into one of my patch files.

@Update bacula to 2.2.8.

Bacula changelog:
http://bacula.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/bacula/branches/Branch-2.2/bacula/ChangeLog?revision=6309&view=markup

Major port change in this version:
-main subpackage is now bacula-client
-server subpackage remains bacula-server
-bat subpackage is new bacula admin tool
-client subpackage goes away.

If the old -main subpackage was installed, the upgrade path is to
install both bacula-client and bacula-server.

Lots of input and assistance from sthen and okan.

To start, add the following to /etc/rc.local:
if [ -x ${PREFIX}/libexec/bacula/bacula-ctl-sd ]; then
  ${PREFIX}/libexec/bacula/bacula-ctl-sd start
  echo -n ' bacula-sd'

if [ -x ${PREFIX}/libexec/bacula/bacula-ctl-dir ]; then

@import of bacula 2.0.3;

Bacula is a set of computer programs that permit you (or the system
administrator) to manage backup, recovery, and verification of
computer data across a network of computers of different kinds.
In technical terms, it is a network Client/Server based backup program.
Bacula is relatively easy to use and efficient, while offering many
advanced storage management features that make it easy to find and
recover lost or damaged files. Due to its modular design, Bacula is
scalable from small single computer systems to systems consisting of
hundreds of computers located over a large network.
