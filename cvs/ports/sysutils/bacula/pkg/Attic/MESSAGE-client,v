@Update bacula to 2.2.8.

Bacula changelog:
http://bacula.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/bacula/branches/Branch-2.2/bacula/ChangeLog?revision=6309&view=markup

Major port change in this version:
-main subpackage is now bacula-client
-server subpackage remains bacula-server
-bat subpackage is new bacula admin tool
-client subpackage goes away.

If the old -main subpackage was installed, the upgrade path is to
install both bacula-client and bacula-server.

Lots of input and assistance from sthen and okan.
ok okan;  "if it works for you, go for it" sthen

Bacula is a set of computer programs that permit you (or the system
administrator) to manage backup, recovery, and verification of
computer data across a network of computers of different kinds.
In technical terms, it is a network Client/Server based backup program.
Bacula is relatively easy to use and efficient, while offering many
advanced storage management features that make it easy to find and
recover lost or damaged files. Due to its modular design, Bacula is
scalable from small single computer systems to systems consisting of
hundreds of computers located over a large network.
