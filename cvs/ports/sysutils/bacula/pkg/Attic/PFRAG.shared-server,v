@update to Bacula 5.2.6, ok ajacoutot@@ merdely@@
- don't use ports libtool, it passes invalid flags to the linker
- since libbaccats-${BACKEND} must have the same .so version as
libbaccats, use a variable to make sure they are kept in-sync
- mark as being SHARED_ONLY and sync/merge plists

@Major update to bacula 5.2.1.

As usual with major version bump, do not forget to run the upgrade
script corresponding to your DB.
A new README is provided in the package.

Tested by sthen@@ and myself.

log
@Update bacula to 3.0.2:
	* Shared objects
	* Virtual backups
	* Duplicate Job Control
	* TLS Authentication
	* Exclude Dir Containing = <filename-string>
	* Plugins including Exchange 2003/2007 Plugin
	* libdbi backend abstraction
	* Bat enhancements

Upgrading from 2.4.4 to 3.0.2 requires updating the database using
/usr/local/libexec/bacula/update_bacula_database.  Database upgrades
from older databases can be done with other scripts in
/usr/local/libexec/bacula/updatedb.  You can determine your database
version in mysql and postgresql with 'select * from version'.

As sthen@@ reminded me and the documentation points out, when upgrading
between major versions (2.x.x -> 3.x.x), you should upgrade all of your
components at the same time due to protocol changes.

a *lot* of help from and ok sthen@@
