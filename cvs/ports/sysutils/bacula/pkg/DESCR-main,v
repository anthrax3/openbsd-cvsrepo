@Update bacula to 3.0.2:
	* Shared objects
	* Virtual backups
	* Duplicate Job Control
	* TLS Authentication
	* Exclude Dir Containing = <filename-string>
	* Plugins including Exchange 2003/2007 Plugin
	* libdbi backend abstraction
	* Bat enhancements

Upgrading from 2.4.4 to 3.0.2 requires updating the database using
/usr/local/libexec/bacula/update_bacula_database.  Database upgrades
from older databases can be done with other scripts in
/usr/local/libexec/bacula/updatedb.  You can determine your database
version in mysql and postgresql with 'select * from version'.

As sthen@@ reminded me and the documentation points out, when upgrading
between major versions (2.x.x -> 3.x.x), you should upgrade all of your
components at the same time due to protocol changes.

a *lot* of help from and ok sthen@@

@Bacula comes by night and sucks the vital essence from your computers.

Bacula is a set of computer programs that permit you (or the system
administrator) to manage backup, recovery, and verification of computer
data across a network of computers of different kinds.  In technical
terms, it is a network Client/Server based backup program.  Bacula is
relatively easy to use and efficient, while offering many advanced
storage management features that make it easy to find and recover lost
or damaged files. Due to its modular design, Bacula is scalable from
small single computer systems to systems consisting of hundreds of
computers located over a large network.

This package contains the bacula-fd "backup agent" that gets installed
on the computers you want to back up.

@Update bacula to 2.2.8.

Bacula changelog:
http://bacula.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/bacula/branches/Branch-2.2/bacula/ChangeLog?revision=6309&view=markup

Major port change in this version:
-main subpackage is now bacula-client
-server subpackage remains bacula-server
-bat subpackage is new bacula admin tool
-client subpackage goes away.

If the old -main subpackage was installed, the upgrade path is to
install both bacula-client and bacula-server.

Lots of input and assistance from sthen and okan.
