@Update bacula to 3.0.2:
	* Shared objects
	* Virtual backups
	* Duplicate Job Control
	* TLS Authentication
	* Exclude Dir Containing = <filename-string>
	* Plugins including Exchange 2003/2007 Plugin
	* libdbi backend abstraction
	* Bat enhancements

Upgrading from 2.4.4 to 3.0.2 requires updating the database using
/usr/local/libexec/bacula/update_bacula_database.  Database upgrades
from older databases can be done with other scripts in
/usr/local/libexec/bacula/updatedb.  You can determine your database
version in mysql and postgresql with 'select * from version'.

As sthen@@ reminded me and the documentation points out, when upgrading
between major versions (2.x.x -> 3.x.x), you should upgrade all of your
components at the same time due to protocol changes.

a *lot* of help from and ok sthen@@

@import of bacula 2.0.3;

Bacula is a set of computer programs that permit you (or the system
administrator) to manage backup, recovery, and verification of
computer data across a network of computers of different kinds.
In technical terms, it is a network Client/Server based backup program.
Bacula is relatively easy to use and efficient, while offering many
advanced storage management features that make it easy to find and
recover lost or damaged files. Due to its modular design, Bacula is
scalable from small single computer systems to systems consisting of
hundreds of computers located over a large network.
