virt-what is a shell script which can be used to detect if the program
is running in a virtual machine.

virt-what supports a very large number of different hypervisor types,
including common open source hypervisors (KVM, Xen, QEMU, VirtualBox,
VMM), mainframe systems like IBM Systemz, LPAR, z/VM, hardware
partitioning schemes like Hitachi Virtage, proprietary hypervisors like
VMWare, Microsoft Hyper-V and much more.

patches to add support for detecting vmm were merged upstream already
