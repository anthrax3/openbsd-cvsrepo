@import of Clusterit 2.4

Clusterit is a collection of clustering tools loosely based on IBM's
PSSP clustering tools. Unlike PSSP or GLUnix, Clusterit allows fast
parallel execution of remote commands as it is written in
architecture-independent C. Administrators can choose from a variety
of authentication methods, including SSH and Kerberos.

With Clusterit, administrators can run parallelized and load
balanced software builds (using jsd/jsh) or manage a heterogeneous
cluster of machines (using dsh/dvt/rvt).
