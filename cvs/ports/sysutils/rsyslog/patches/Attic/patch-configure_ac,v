@import rsyslog-4.6.3

Rsyslog is an enhanced multi-threaded syslogd with a focus on
security and reliability. Among others, it offers support for
on-demand disk buffering, reliable syslog over TCP, SSL, TLS and
RELP, writing to databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and many
more), email alerting, fully configurable output formats (including
high-precision timestamps), the ability to filter on any part of
the syslog message, on-the-wire message compression, and the ability
to convert text files to syslog. It is a drop-in replacement for
stock syslogd and able to work with the same configuration file
syntax. Its advanced features make it suitable for enterprise-class,
encryption protected syslog relay chains while at the same time
being very easy to setup for the novice user.
