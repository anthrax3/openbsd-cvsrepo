@ipmitool is a utility for managing and configuring devices that support
the Intelligent Platform Management Interface. IPMI is an open standard for
monitoring, logging, recovery, inventory, and control of hardware that is
implemented independent of the main CPU, BIOS, and OS. The service processor
(or Baseboard Management Controller, BMC) is the brain behind platform
management and its primary purpose is to handle the autonomous sensor
monitoring and event logging features.

The ipmitool program provides a simple command-line interface to this
BMC. It features the ability to read the sensor data repository (SDR) and
print sensor values, display the contents of the System Event Log (SEL),
print Field Replaceable Unit (FRU) inventory information, read and set LAN
configuration parameters, and perform remote chassis power control.

This package supports lan (IPMI 1.5), lanplus (IPMI 2.0), and serial.
