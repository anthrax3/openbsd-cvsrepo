@update to U-Boot 2017.09-rc2

Tested on CuBox-i4Pro, BeagleBone Black, PandaBoard ES and
Raspberry Pi 3 Model B.

This corrects a regression on rpi3 when booting off USB where the EFI
loader would stop iterating over block devices when loading from SD card
failed reported by 'R0me0' on bugs@@.

@update to U-Boot 2017.07

Revert commit 25877d4e4c45451c5398aec3de50e0d5befe0e9f to add
CONFIG_OF_EMBED=y back to rpi configs so rpi3 will continue to work.
Tracked down by kettenis@@

While Allwinner A64/H5 targets are built an Allwinner specific build of
ARM Trusted Firmware will need to become a build prequisite in future,
so U-Boot can build complete images after a BL31 environment variable is
set at build time with the path to a prebuilt bl31.bin.

@update to U-Boot 2016.09

Remove patches to set board ids on novena and cubox/hummingboard we no
longer require.  Also remove some OpenBSD build fix patches that were
accepted upstream and the cm-fx6/utilite distro_bootcmd patch which
no longer cleanly applies.

Tested on CuBox-i4Pro, BeagleBone Black and PandaBoard ES.

@Update to U-Boot 2016.07 which will be used in the armv7 release.

This includes the patch to not allocate memory from holes with the efi

@Import U-Boot 2016.05

U-Boot is a firmware for embedded boards based on PowerPC, ARM, MIPS and
several other processors, which can be installed in a boot ROM and used to
initialize and test the hardware or to download and run application code.

As ARM systems often do not come with firmware it must be supplied on
an SD card or MMC device to have a bootable system.

This port provides U-Boot for various boards using ARM processors.

armv7 requires the support for EFI payloads added in this release to run
the bootloader.  A proposed patch to prevent the EFI interface from
allocating pages from unpopulated memory by Alexander Graf is included
which will hopefully be part of future releases:
http://marc.info/?l=u-boot&m=146434472023891&w=2

Feedback from jca@@ and sthen@@.  ok sthen@@ on an earlier version without
the EFI patch.
