Upgrading from an earlier version
=================================

Some internally used settings keys have been renamed for consistency and
upon upgrading from an older version the setup wizard dialog will pop
up. Follow the prompts and select "Yes" when asked if you have used
Tarsnap on this machine in the past and have a key. Select the previous
key if available in the dropdown list or locate it manually and proceed.
Your jobs and settings should remain unchanged.
