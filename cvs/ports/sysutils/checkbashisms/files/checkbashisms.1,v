@.TH CHECKBASHISMS 1 "Debian Utilities" "DEBIAN" \" -*- nroff -*-
.SH NAME
checkbashisms \- check for bashisms in /bin/sh scripts
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBcheckbashisms\fR \fIscript\fR ...
.br
\fBcheckbashisms \-\-help|\-\-version\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBcheckbashisms\fR, based on one of the checks from the \fBlintian\fR
system, performs basic checks on \fI/bin/sh\fR shell scripts for the
possible presence of bashisms.  It takes the names of the shell
scripts on the command line, and outputs warnings if possible bashisms
are detected.
.PP
Note that the definition of a bashism in this context roughly equates 
to "a shell feature that is not required to be supported by POSIX"; this 
means that some issues flagged may be permitted under optional sections 
of POSIX, such as XSI or User Portability.
.PP
In cases where POSIX and Debian Policy disagree, \fBcheckbashisms\fR by 
default allows extensions permitted by Policy but may also provide 
options for stricter checking.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR \-\-help ", " \-h
Show a summary of options.
.TP
.BR \-\-newline ", " \-n
Check for "echo \-n" usage (non POSIX but required by Debian Policy 10.4.)
.TP
.BR \-\-posix ", " \-p
Check for issues which are non POSIX but required to be supported by Debian
Policy 10.4 (implies \-n).
.TP
.BR \-\-force ", " \-f
Force each script to be checked, even if it would normally not be (for 
instance, it has a bash or non POSIX shell shebang or appears to be a 
shell wrapper).
.TP
.BR \-\-extra ", " \-x
Highlight lines which, whilst they do not contain bashisms, may be
useful in determining whether a particular issue is a false positive
which may be ignored.
For example, the use of "$BASH_ENV" may be preceeded by checking
whether "$BASH" is set.
.TP
.BR \-\-version ", " \-v
Show version and copyright information.
.SH "EXIT VALUES"
The exit value will be 0 if no possible bashisms or other problems
were detected.  Otherwise it will be the sum of the following error
values:
.TP
1
A possible bashism was detected.
.TP
2
A file was skipped for some reason, for example, because it was
unreadable or not found.  The warning message will give details.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR lintian (1).
.SH AUTHOR
\fBcheckbashisms\fR was originally written as a shell script by Yann Dirson
<dirson@@debian.org> and rewritten in Perl with many more features by
Julian Gilbey <jdg@@debian.org>.
