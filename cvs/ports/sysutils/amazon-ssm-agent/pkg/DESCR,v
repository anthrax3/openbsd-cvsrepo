@The Amazon EC2 Simple Systems Manager (SSM) Agent is software developed for the
Simple Systems Manager Service. The SSM Agent is the primary component of a
feature called Run Command.

The SSM Agent runs on EC2 instances and enables you to quickly and easily
execute remote commands or scripts against one or more instances. The agent uses
SSM. When you execute a command, the agent on the instance processes the
document and configures the instance as specified.
