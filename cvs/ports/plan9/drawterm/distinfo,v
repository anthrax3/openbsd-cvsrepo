@update to drawterm-20160914

Port switched to the fork that is currently maintained against 9front source.
User-visible changes:

- fixes a glitch in graphics rendering, primarily noticed when viewing images in
  the web browser mothra(1).
- defaults to new dp9ik authentication and rcpu(1) connection method, devolving
  to the old p9sk1 and cpu(1).
- adds new cryptographic support from 9front libmp and libsec libraries.
- audio now works and is enabled.
- keyboard/mouse input is now much more responsive over high-latency
  connections.
- new flag, -G, starts the session without the GUI.

@import drawterm 20110221

Drawterm is a program that users of non-Plan 9 systems can use to
establish graphical cpu connections with Plan 9 cpu servers.  Just as
a real Plan 9 terminal does, drawterm serves its local name space as
well as some devices (the keyboard, mouse, and screen) to a remote cpu
server, which mounts this name space on /mnt/term and starts a shell.
Typically, either explicitly or via the profile, one uses the shell to
start rio.
