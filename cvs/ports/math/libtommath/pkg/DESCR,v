@LibTomMath is a free open source portable number theoretic multiple-precision
integer library written entirely in C. The library is designed to provide a
simple to work with API to fairly efficient routines from various branches of
number theory:

 * Simple Algebraic
  - Addition
  - Subtraction
  - Multiplication
  - Squaring
  - Division
 * Digit Manipulation
  - Shift left/right whole digits (mult by 2b by moving digits)
  - Fast multiplication/division by 2 and 2k for k>1
  - Binary AND, OR and XOR gates
 * Modular Reductions
  - Barrett Reduction (fast for any p)
  - Montgomery Reduction (faster for any odd p)
  - DR Reduction (faster for any restricted p see manual)
  - 2k Reduction (fast reduction modulo 2p - k for k < MP_MASK and for
    k > MP_MASK)
  - The exptmod logic can use any of the five reduction algorithms when
    appropriate with a single function call.
 * Number Theoretic
  - Greatest Common Divisor
  - Least Common Multiple
  - Jacobi Symbol Computation (falls back to Legendre for prime moduli)
  - Multiplicative Inverse
  - Extended Euclidean Algorithm
  - Modular Exponentiation
  - Fermat and Miller-Rabin Primality Tests, utility function such as is_prime
    and next_prime
 * Miscellaneous
  - Root finding over Z
  - Pseudo-random integers
  - Signed and Unsigned comparisons
 * Optimizations
  - Fast Comba based Multiplier, Squaring and Montgomery routines.
  - Montgomery, Diminished Radix and Barrett based modular exponentiation.
  - Karatsuba and Toom-Cook multiplication algorithms.
  - Many pointer aliasing optimiztions throughout the entire library.
