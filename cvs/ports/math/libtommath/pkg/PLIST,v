@update to libtommath-1.0

License changed from public domain to WTFPL

Upsteam code changes are mostly bug fixes.  Port changes are:

 * switch to GH_* infrastructure (-bzip2 bdep, no WRKDIST fixing)
 * drop PDF manual (which doesn't add much to comments in headers)
 * tests are no longer interactive

New MASTER_SITES as a consequence, and buildtime bzip2 dependency. While at it,
change my email address.
