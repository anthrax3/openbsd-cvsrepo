@Numexpr is a fast numerical expression evaluator for NumPy. With it,
expressions that operate on arrays (like "3*a+4*b") are accelerated
and use less memory than doing the same calculation in Python.

In addition, its multi-threaded capabilities can make use of all your
cores, which may accelerate computations, most specially if they are
not memory-bounded (e.g. those using transcendental functions).
