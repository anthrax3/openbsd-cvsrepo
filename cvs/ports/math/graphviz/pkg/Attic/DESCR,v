@finally update to graphviz 2.12
initial port, most things appear to work after fixes to handle new gd,
to get plugins to work, and to fix xlib output).

Set up as a MULTI_PACKAGES so that we can sort further components into
distinct parts later.

@graphviz is a set of graph drawing tools for Unix or MS-Windows
(win32), including a web service interface (webdot).  Graph
drawing addresses the problem of visualizing structural information
by constructing geometric representations of abstract graphs and
networks. 

The goal of graphviz has been twofold: 

    to find efficient algorithms for making very readable
    drawings of graphs up to several hundreds of nodes,
    approaching the quality of manual layouts (made
    with CAD tools).  The algorithms should scale even
    further, as layout of large graphs can also offer
    a gestalt view of complex systems.

    to create convenient graph drawing systems and web
    services. This means defining useful interfaces and
    features to support applications.

The package includes 

     dot - makes hierarchical layouts of directed graphs 
     neato - makes "spring" model layouts of undirected graphs 
     dotty - a customizable interface written in LEFTY 
     tcldot - a customizable graphical interface written in tcl7.6 
     libgraph - the base library for graph tools
