@Foma is a compiler, programming language, and C library for constructing
finite-state automata and transducers for various uses. It has specific
support for many natural language processing applications such as
producing morphological analyzers. Although NLP applications are
probably the main use of foma, it is sufficiently generic to use for a
large number of purposes.

The foma interface is similar to the Xerox xfst interface, and supports
most of the commands and the regular expression syntax in xfst. Many
grammars written for xfst compile out-of-the-box with foma.

The library contains efficient implementations of all classical
automata/transducer algorithms: determinization, minimization,
epsilon-removal, composition, boolean operations. Also, more advanced
construction methods are available: context restriction, quotients,
first-order regular logic, transducers from replacement rules, etc.
