1.1
log
@the makefile does some crazy thing with libraries. Sometimes the timestamps
don't quite match, and all hell breaks loose.

MAKE DARN SURE it gets its file by forcing them down the problematic target.
Yep, sometimes ar will replace the same files twice. Which is always better
than 0.

this has long been an annoyance. Why do every single math guy still write
makefiles by hand that look like fortran77 code ?

(also fix an error in popen by speaking the right standardese)
