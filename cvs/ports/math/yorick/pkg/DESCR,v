@Update to yorick-2.1; from Daniel Dickman
@
text
@Yorick is an interpreted language for scientific computing and
numerical analysis, very similar to Matlab.

Yorick has a compact syntax, similar to C, but with array operators.
It is easily expandable through dynamic linking of C libraries,
allows efficient manipulation of arbitrary size/dimension arrays,
and offers extensive graphic capabilities.

Yorick includes an interactive graphics package, and a binary file
package capable of translating to and from the raw numeric formats
of all modern computers.

Yorick's array syntax, interpreted programs are compact,
nearly free of explicit loops, and can run at speeds up to
20% of optimized compiled speed.

It can do interactive graphics via the X Window System,
including x-y plots, quadrilateral meshes and cell arrays.
Includes tools to assist making animated and simple 3d
graphs.

Supports output directly to your screen, in PostScript and
binary CGM format.
