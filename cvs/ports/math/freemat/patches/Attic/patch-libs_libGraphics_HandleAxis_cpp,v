@update to 3.1, which includes our all patches (and introduces some new
ones);

3.1 is a bugfix release, but also includes new threading api, perl-style
regular expressions, and the regression test suite (use run_tests).

log
@import FreeMat 2.0

FreeMat is a free environment for rapid engineering and scientific
prototyping and data processing. It is similar to commercial systems
such as MATLAB from Mathworks, and IDL from Research Systems, but is
Open Source. FreeMat includes several novel features such as a codeless
interface to external C/C++/FORTRAN code, parallel/distributed
algorithm development (via MPI), and plotting and visualization
capabilities.
