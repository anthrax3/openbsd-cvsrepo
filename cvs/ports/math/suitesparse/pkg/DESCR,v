@SuiteSparse is a suite of sparse matrix algorithms, including:

* UMFPACK: multifrontal LU factorization. Appears as LU and x=A\b in MATLAB.
* CHOLMOD: supernodal Cholesky.  Appears as CHOL and x=A\b in MATLAB.
* SPQR: multifrontal QR.  Appears as QR and x=A\b in MATLAB.
* KLU and BTF: sparse LU factorization, well-suited for circuit simulation.
  Appears in Xyce by Sandia, and many commercial circuit simulation packages.
* Ordering methods (AMD, CAMD, COLAMD, and CCOLAMD). AMD and COLAMD appear in
  MATLAB.
* CSparse and CXSparse: a concise sparse Cholesky factorization package for my
  SIAM book.
* UFget: a MATLAB interface for the UF Sparse Matrix Collection.
* spqr_rank: a MATLAB package for reliable sparse rank detection, null set
  bases, pseudoinverse solutions, and basic solutions.
* Factorize: an object-oriented solver for MATLAB (a reusable backslash).
* SSMULT and SFMULT: sparse matrix multiplication. Appears as C=A*B in MATLAB.
* ... and many other packages.
