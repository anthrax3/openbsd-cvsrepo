@R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics.
It is a GNU project which is similar to the S language and environment
which was developed at Bell Laboratories (formerly AT&T, now Lucent
Technologies) by John Chambers and colleagues. R can be considered as a
different implementation of S. There are some important differences, but
much code written for S runs unaltered under R.

R provides a wide variety of statistical (linear and nonlinear
modelling, classical statistical tests, time-series analysis,
classification, clustering, ...) and graphical techniques, and is highly
extensible.

R is a clone of The New S Language by Becker, Chambers, and Wilks of AT&T.
A comprehensive statistics package with a full scripting language, many
statistical operators, load/save, extensive help, graphical capabilities 
including X11, PostScript, HP and other devices. Ideal for interactive
exploration of data.

Once you've installed R, you can start it just by typing R. There is
extensive online documentation; you can start with help() (note that almost 
every S command or function has parentheses after it, so you type
help(A) for info about A).

If you have S users onsite, you may want to "cd ${LOCALBASE}/bin; ln -s R S"

@Misc. minor fixes:

COMMENTS don't end with .
HOMEPAGE is there for a reason.
Only bsd.port.mk uses tabspaces set to 4.
pre-package does not run as root, post-install does.
copying files is not good enough to make them executable.
