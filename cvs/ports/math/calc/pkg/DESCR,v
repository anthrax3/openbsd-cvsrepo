@Calc is an interactive calculator which provides for easy large numeric
calculations, but which also can be easily programmed for difficult or long
calculations using a C-like language featuring variable declarations,
expressions, tests, labels, loops, file operations, and function calls,
and with a rich set of builtin mathematical and programmatic functions.

It can accept a command line argument, in which case it executes that single
command and exits. Otherwise, it enters interactive mode. In this mode, it
accepts commands one at a time, processes them, and displays the answers. In
the simplest case, commands are simply expressions which are evaluated.

Calc is arbitrary precision arithmetic system that uses a C-like
language. Calc is useful as a calculator, an algorithm prototyper and
as a mathematical research tool. More importantly, calc provides one
with a machine independent means of computation. Calc comes with a
rich set of builtin mathematical and programmatic functions. A
partial list of calc builtin functions is available.

The calc language is a C-like language. The language includes
commands such as variable declarations, expressions, tests, labels,
loops, file operations, function calls. These commands are very
similar to their counterparts in C.
