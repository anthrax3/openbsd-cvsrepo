1.1.1.1
log
@This package supplies half-precision floating point values w/ 1 bit
of sign, 5 bits of exponent, 11 bits of mantissa trailing a leading
1 bit with proper underflow.
These arise commonly in GPU applications.

ok sthen@@, who also suggested to put it into math/

Not yet added to math/Makefile, because this is for ghc-7.10.3.
