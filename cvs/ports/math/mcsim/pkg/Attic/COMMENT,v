1.1.1.1

@MCSim is a general purpose modeling and simulation program which
also performs standart or Monte Carlo simulations. It allows you
to specify a set of linear or nonlinear equations and solve them
using parameter values you choose or parameter values sampled
from specified statistical distributions. Outputs can be compared.
 
It consists of two pieces - a model generator and a simulation
engine. The model generator was created to facilitate the model
maintenance and simulation definition, while keeping execution
time fast. Other programs have been created to the same end, the
Matlab family of graphical interactive programs being some of the
more general and easy to use.
