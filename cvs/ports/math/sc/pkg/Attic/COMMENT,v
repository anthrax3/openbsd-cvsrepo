1.1.1.1
log
@Sc is a spreadsheet calculator based on rectangular tables
like a financial spreadsheet. When invoked it presents you
with a table organized as rows and columns of cells. If
invoked without a file argument, by default the initial
table is empty.
 
Each cell can be associated with a numeric value, a label
string and/or an expression which evaluates to a numeric
value or label string, often based on other cell values
(formula).
