@- initial import of p5-Math-GMP-1.03

--
Math::GMP is designed to be a drop-in replacement both for Math::BigInt
and for regular integer arithmetic. Unlike BigInt, though, Math::GMP
uses the GNU gmp library for all of its calculations, as opposed
to straight Perl functions. This results in a speed increase of
anywhere from 5 to 30 times.

A Math::GMP object can be used just as a normal numeric scalar would
be -- the module overloads the normal arithmetic operators to provide
as seamless an interface as possible.
