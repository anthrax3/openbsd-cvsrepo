@Universal input method.

Contains the basic library and utilities like uim-xim (wedge for XIM), 
refer to packages uim-gtk and uim-qt to make use of it under gtk+/qt.

Note that one of these packages is generally required in most 
circumstances.

Split stuff into subpackages, so that you don't need to have gtk if

in your .xinitrc.

Under gtk+,
uim-pref-gtk can be used to set up basic preferences.
uim-toolbar-gtk should be run along the application in
order to be able to enter japanese text.

uim is using the utf8 encoding internally, so this
should be used in various applications (e.g.,
set encoding=utf8 in gvim).
