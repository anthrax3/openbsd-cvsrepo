@Import libretro-genesis-plus-gx-1.7.4.

Genesis Plus GX is an open-source Sega 8/16 bit emulator focused on accuracy
and portability.

The source code, initially based on Genesis Plus 1.2a by Charles MacDonald
has been heavily modified & enhanced, with respect to original goals and
design, in order to improve emulation accuracy as well as adding support for
new peripherals, cartridge or console hardware and many other exciting
features.

The result is that Genesis Plus GX is now more a continuation of the
original project than a simple port, providing very accurate emulation and
100% compatibility with Genesis / Mega Drive, Sega/Mega CD, Master System,
Game Gear & SG-1000 released software (including all unlicensed or pirate
known dumps), also emulating backwards compatibility modes when available.
