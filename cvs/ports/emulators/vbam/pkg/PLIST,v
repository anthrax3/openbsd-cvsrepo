@gtk-update-icon-cache:
Don't redirect errors to /dev/null and don't return true(1)
unconditionally. Instead, don't check for the existence of index.theme.
This will allow us to catch errors that may be happening because of a
missing dependency in the chain.

Some hidden issues may appear, in which case please contact me.

1.1.1.1
log
@Import vbam-1.8.0.1054.

VBA-M is a fork from the now inactive VisualBoy Advance project, with
goals to improve the capabilities and features of the emulator.


This is basically a replacement for emulators/vba, which is currently
broken in at least two ways:
 - emulation speed is whacked out when sndiod is running
 - gvba recently started segfaulting on startup
