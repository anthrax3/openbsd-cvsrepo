@Frodo is a freeware C64 emulator for BeOS, Unix, MacOS, AmigaOS, Win32
and RiscOS systems and the world's first C64 emulator not bearing a
"64" in its name. :-) (No, it has absolutely nothing to do with
frodo.hiof.no, that's a pure coincidence.)

Frodo was developed to reproduce the graphics of games and demos
better than the existing C64 emulators. Therefore Frodo has relatively
high system requirements: It should only be run on systems with at
least a PowerPC/Pentium/68060. But on the other hand, Frodo can
display raster effects correctly that only result in a flickering mess
with other emulators.

Frodo comes in three flavours: The "normal" Frodo with a line-based
emulation, the improved line-based emulation "Frodo PC", and the
single-cycle emulation Frodo SC that is slower but far more
compatible.

In addition to a precise 6510/VIC emulation, Frodo features a
processor-level 1541 emulation that is even able to handle about 95%
of all fast loaders. There is also a faster 1541 emulation for four
drives in .d64/x64 disk images, .t64/LYNX archives, or directories of
the host system.

The current OpenBSD port does not support a joystick.

Important: when sound is available, don't use `limit speed', as sound
output will pace the emulator automatically, whereas `limit speed' will
interfere and produce garbled output.

The current OpenBSD port does not support sound yet (there is a bug in
Frodo's code), nor a joystick.
