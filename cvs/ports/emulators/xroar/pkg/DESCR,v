Tandy Colour Computer (CoCo) models 1 & 2. Some features are:

- Emulates Dragon 32, Dragon 64, Dragon 200-E, Tandy CoCo 1 & 2, and
  compatibles.
- Emulates DragonDOS, Delta and RSDOS disk systems.
- Emulates the Orchestra 90-CC stereo sound cartridge.
- Supports both raw and translated keyboard modes.
- Reads and writes virtual cassettes (compact .cas files and audio files).
- Reads and writes VDK, JVC and DMK format virtual floppy diskettes.
- Saves and loads machine snapshots.
- Provides a GDB target for remote debugging.
- Initial Glenside IDE support.
