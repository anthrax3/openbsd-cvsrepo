@SuperH was missed from DESCR. Noticed by author. Bump PKGNAME.

@GXemul is a machine emulator. The initial goal was to write a simple
64-bit MIPS emulator for running multiprocessor experiments with a
microkernel, but the emulator can be used for many other things. While
some simulators only simulate a CPU, GXemul also simulates other
hardware components, making it possible to use the emulator to run
unmodified operating systems, such as NetBSD, OpenBSD, or Linux.
Currently emulated CPUs are: ARM, M88k, MIPS, PowerPC and SuperH.

gxemul is a machine emulator. The main goal is to
emulate MIPS-like CPUs and enough surrounding hardware to
fake real machines, capable of running real (unmodified)
operating systems (such as NetBSD, Linux, FreeBSD,
or OpenBSD), and to assist in experimenting with MIPS in general.

In addition to emulating MIPS-like CPUs an experimental
support for other CPU types (like PPC or HPPA) also exists.
