@mips64emul project was renamed to gxemul because now
it emulates not only MIPS CPU.

@mips64emul is a MIPS machine emulator. The goals are to
emulate MIPS-like CPUs and enough surrounding hardware to
fake real machines, capable of running real (unmodified)
operating systems (such as NetBSD, Linux, FreeBSD,
or OpenBSD), and to assist in experimenting with MIPS in general.
