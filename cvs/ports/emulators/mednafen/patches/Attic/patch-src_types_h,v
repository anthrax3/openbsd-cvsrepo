@Import mednafen 0.8.D.3 as 0.8.3.

Mednafen is a portable, utilizing OpenGL and SDL,
argument(command-line)-driven multi-system emulator with many advanced
features. The Atari Lynx, GameBoy (Color), GameBoy Advance, NES, PC
Engine(TurboGrafx 16), SuperGrafx, Neo Geo Pocket (Color), PC-FX, and
WonderSwan (Color) are emulated. Mednafen has the ability to remap
hotkey functions and virtual system inputs to a keyboard, a joystick, or
both simultaneously. Save states are supported, as is real-time game
rewinding. Screen snapshots may be taken at the press of a button, and
are saved in the popular PNG file format.
