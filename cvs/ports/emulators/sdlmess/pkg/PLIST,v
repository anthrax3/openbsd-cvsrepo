@Import sdlmess 0.130:
MESS stands for Multi Emulator Super System. It is an emulator for the
hardware of many different games consoles (e.g. Sega, NES, SNES, etc.)
as well as many different old games-oriented home computers (e.g. C64,
C128, ZX80, etc.)
SDLMESS is a port of MESS using the SDL library.

After many submissions and updates by Pierre Riteau (at gmail), thanks!
