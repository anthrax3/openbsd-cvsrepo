@Wine is a Windows emulator running under Unix on i386 (and higher) CPUs.
It is still Alpha quality, i.e. don't expect it to run your typical large 
MS-Windows application package, but it is definitely on its way ...

To use Wine, you need to enable the machdep.userldt sysctl, either via
/etc/sysctl.conf, or by entering (as root):
    sysctl -w machdep.userldt=1

@Bring wine-1.1.21 in tree.

This is still work in progress. That means its not working yet, its not
linked to the build and it still has a long way to go.
We're adding this here so that developers can more easily work on it.

Okay sthen@@.

Wine relies on the configuration file /etc/wine.conf to
contain valid assignments of Unix directories to DOS drive letters,
and for certain other options (see "man wine" for details).
You will most probably have to edit it, after the install...
