log
@Update to QEMU 1.0, from Brad.

- disable the BSD userland emulation support for now, it's not widely useful yet
- workaround for incorrect time_t type assumption, from stsp@@

N.B. As of QEMU 1.0 the i386 target has been renamed from qemu to
qemu-system-i386, you will need to change scripts/command lines as necessary.

ok stsp@@ dcoppa@@
