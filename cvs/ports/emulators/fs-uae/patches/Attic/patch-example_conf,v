@Update fs-uae to 2.2.0.

Upstream took most of our patches, they mostly have gone.

There is one remaining -O0 in the top level Makefile, which works
around an optimiser bug. Yay.

+# You will want to copy this to ~/.config/fs-uae/fs-uae.conf

 # The encoding of the configuration file must be UTF-8 (or ASCII)
 #
 # All paths can be either absolute, or relative to the current working
 # directory. The same is true for all paths in the configuration file.
 #
-# If you on Windows specify paths with backslash, you must escape them
-# (use \\ instead of just \ - c:\\path\\to\\file). You can also just use
-# forward slashes instead (c:/path/to/file).
-# 
 # You can start paths with ~/ or $HOME/ to refer to the user's home.
 # Example: ~/Documents/Floppies/example.adf
 #
 # There are many options available to configure FS-UAE.
 # See http://fengestad.no/wp/fs-uae/configuration
 # for a complete list of configuration options with documentation
