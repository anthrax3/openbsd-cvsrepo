@o take over maintainership
o too many changes to mention specifically, but amongst them:
	- better error reporting
	- openbsd boots, freebsd boots
	- new 'term' flavor, I added a textmode interface, the only drawback
	  is that control-c is intercepted, and you must kill -9 it from
	  another tty if it doesn't exit normally
	- new flavors:
		- debugger -> debug (for shortness)
		- i386
		- pci
		- smp
		- net (compiles, does not yet provide networking, if anyone
			wants to help, I'd be ELATED to have this fixed!)
		- no_x11 (made it actually work)
		- term (make sure to use 'log: /dev/null' or something else
		  on the cmdline, otherwise, debugging and the screen will
		  start getting quite confusing!)
	- better error reporting (and no error reporting where it is not
	  necessary; a typicall boot of cdrom28.fs is a screenful of output now)
	- in general, if the hardware reaches an unknown state, fail
	  gracefully instead of calling exit(1) .. are we trying to work or
	  are we trying to .. fail?  I like working myself.
