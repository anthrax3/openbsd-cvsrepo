@Bochs is a portable x86 CPU emulation software that emulates
enough of the x86 CPU (by default it emulates 586 instruction set),
related AT hardware, and BIOS to run DOS, Windows 95/98, Minix 2.0 and
other OS's, all on your workstation.

Flavors:
	debug   - Build with Bochs' internal debugging support
	no_x11  - Do not build with X support

@update to 2.1; with input from brad, grange, and Oliver Cherrier

new flavors:
	no_mmx  - do not build with mmx support
	no_comp - do not build with compressed hard drive support

Also new in this version is the vga font is compiled into the binary, no
more 'xset fp+ ..' or editing XF86Config to run bochs!

@- add USE_X11 if X support is requested (default).
- always build term and nogui support.
- if no_x11 is used, don't use mkfontdir nor X11 fonts.
- install bochsrc(5)

@update to bochs 2.0:

Changes in 2.0 (December 21, 2002):

Since the change log is hundreds of lines long, here is a very brief summary.
- 2x emulation speedup!!!
- added plugin devices and guis. Now you can compile with many more
  options, and choose between them at runtime.
- added emulation of AMD x86-64, MMX, SSE, SSE2 instructions
- add wxWindows port (a graphical configuration interface and display lib)
  and SVGAlib port (full screen display for Linux without X11)
- improvements in many I/O devices: for example up to 8 hard disks/cdroms,
  TUN/TAP network interface, 360k floppies,
- improved MacOSX/Carbon interface and updated MacOS9 port
- GDB remote stub, allows symbolic debugging with Bochs simulation.
- support for up to 32gig hard disk images

@after much stagnation, bochs is back.  Thanks to angelos@@ who got the
networking working, I'm committing this from inside bochs!

There are too many changes to mention, not the least of which is
two hard drive support, smp (up to 16 cpus), networking, and much,
much more ..
