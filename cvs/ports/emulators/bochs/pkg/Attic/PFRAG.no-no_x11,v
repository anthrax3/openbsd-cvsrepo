1.2
log
@update to 2.1; with input from brad, grange, and Oliver Cherrier

new flavors:
	no_mmx  - do not build with mmx support
	no_comp - do not build with compressed hard drive support

Also new in this version is the vga font is compiled into the binary, no
more 'xset fp+ ..' or editing XF86Config to run bochs!
