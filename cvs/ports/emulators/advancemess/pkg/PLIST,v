@Import emulators/advancemess

AdvanceMESS is an unofficial MESS (Multi Emulator Super System) version
with advanced video support. It is an emulator for the hardware of many
different games consoles (e.g. Sega, NES, SNES, etc.) as well as many
different old games-oriented home computers (e.g. C64, C128, ZX80, etc.)

AdvanceMESS supports many special video effects to improve image quality
when it's stretched. The most advanced effects add missing pixels trying
to match the image patterns.
