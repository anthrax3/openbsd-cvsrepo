@Delete vgb, mastergear, and ines.

These emulators were imported 12 years ago and have been left untouched
since then. They require Linux emulation to run, which is a liability. At
the time of import, they were the only console emulators in the tree, but
now there are many better options that are cross platform, more accurate,
and with more features (mednafen, gambatte, vbam, fceux, nestopia...).
