@GNS3 is a visual design tool and front-end to access emulated routers.
It can export graphical network maps (with a reasonable set of icons for
simple diagram-creations needs), control Dynamips and QEMU instances
(including adding and removing connections between nodes) and more.

Control over QEMU nodes is particularly nice; by default GNS3 uses
a "base" disk image, allowing simple and disk-efficient creation of
large networks based on a common operating system.

GNS3 is a graphical network simulator that allows you to design complex
network topologies and to launch simulations on them.
It is an excellent complementary tool to real labs for administrators of
Cisco networks or people wanting to pass their CCNA, CCNP, CCIP or CCIE
certifications.  It can also be used to experiment features of Cisco IOS
or to check configurations that need to be deployed later on real
routers.
