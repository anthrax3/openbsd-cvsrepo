@By default, a dynamips instance will take 100% of the host CPU. To
avoid this, please read the "idle-pc" section in the README file
(${PREFIX}/share/doc/dynamips/README). The configuration generator
"dynagen" (available separately) can help find a good value.

You can greatly reduce startup times by uncompressing your IOS
images with unzip.

N.B. The just-in-time compiler, required for good performance,
is currently only supported on i386 and amd64.

@import dynamips:

Dynamips emulates various MIPS64 and PowerPC-based processors
and other hardware found in Cisco routers, including many NM/PA
modules e.g. Ethernet, fast Ethernet, serial, ATM, switch.

It is able to boot a large number of Cisco IOS releases
(not included) for the 7200, 3600, 3700 and 2600 platforms.
