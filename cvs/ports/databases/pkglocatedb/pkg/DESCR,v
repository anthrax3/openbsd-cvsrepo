@hopefully final change for now... kill the src/x db. it's much more efficient
to go to the source when we need it !

@Database of files from all packages in the ports tree, including names
of the packages containing them. This is in a format suitable for use with
locate(1), for instance through the convenience script 
${PREFIX}/bin/pkg_locate

The files from src and X are now in
/usr/lib/locate/src.db
and
${X11BASE}/lib/locate/xorg.db

@Rename the utility from pkglocate to pkg_locate to be consistent with
the other pkg_* tools.
pkglocate is kept as a link to not break backward compat.

Database of files from all packages in the ports tree, including names

Note: like sqlports, this is generated from the ports tree itself,
so if your tree is in bad shape re: conflicts etc, this won't build.

ok espie, discussed with many, reminded by oga@@
