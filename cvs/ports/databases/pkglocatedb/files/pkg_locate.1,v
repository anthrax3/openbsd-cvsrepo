.Sh NAME
.Nm pkg_locate
.Nd find files in OpenBSD packages quickly
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm pkg_locate
.Bk -words
.Op Fl bciS
.Op Fl l Ar limit
.Ar pattern ...
.Ek
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
searches a database of files for all pathnames which match the
specified pattern.
The options for
.Nm
are the same as for
.Xr locate 1 ,
which is used internally.
.Pp
There are two flavors of the pkglocatedb package:
installed as
.Pa pkglocatedb ,
providing a database with all files in
.Ox
packages; and
.Pa pkglocatedb-src ,
providing the same database including all installation set files.
.Pp
The search result for
.Ox
package files has the following format:
.Pp
.Dl fullpkgname:pkgpath:pathname
.Pp
where
.Ar fullpkgname
is the name of the package (see
.Xr bsd.port.mk 5 )
without the trailing .tgz,
.Ar pkgpath
is the location within the ports tree (see
.Xr pkgpath 7 )
and
.Ar pathname
is the absoute pathname of the installed file.
.Pp
The search result for base system and X Window System files has the
following format:
.Pp
.Dl srcdir/setname:setfilename:pathname
.Pp
where
.Ar srcdir
is
.Qq src
for base system or
.Qq xenocara
for X Window System,
.Ar setname
is the name of the install set,
.Ar setfilename
is the name of the install set file including the release version
without the .tgz suffix, and
.Ar pathname
is the absoute pathname of the installed file.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl b
For each entry in the database, perform the search on the last
component of path.
.It Fl c
Suppress normal output; instead print a count of matching file names.
.It Fl i
Ignore case distinctions in both the pattern and the database.
.It Fl l Ar limit
Limit output to a specific number of files and exit.
.It Fl S
Print some statistics about the database and exit.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -compact -width /usr/local/share/pkglocatedb
.It /usr/local/share/pkglocatedb
locate database containing information about files in
.Ox
packages and optionally in the
.Ox
installation sets.

Use
.Xr mmap 2
instead of the
.Xr stdio 3
library.
This is the default behavior.
It performs better in most cases.
