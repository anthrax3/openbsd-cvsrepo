log
@mydumper is tocuhing internal MySQL API it should not be. upstream has disabled
the binlog support until something can be done to fix it properly.

"The real problem here is that no application should ever include sql_common.h
or try to execute, the internal to libmysql functions, simple_command() or
advanced_command() directly.

The primary reason for this is that these functions are not safe for internal
API or structure changes and may cause applications crashes between even minor
versions of libmysql.a"
