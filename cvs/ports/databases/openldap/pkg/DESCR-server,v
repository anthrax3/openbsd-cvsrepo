@- Enable the MDB backend now that the writemap-enforcing patch has been
fixed. Document the writemap requirement in DESCR-server. Add a patchset
from Paul B. Henson to use writemap in the test suite.

- Don't @@sample slapd.conf. This config backend has been deprecated for
some time and will be removed in a future OpenLDAP release. Their
recommended configuration engine is slapd-config(5), see
http://www.openldap.org/doc/admin24/slapdconf2.html

- Do @@sample /etc/openldap/slapd.d, the default location for slapd-config(5)
storage. Also add accompanying @@extraunexec.

- @@sample some schema files that were missed in the update to 2.4.23
several years ago. Better late than never :-)

@OpenLDAP is a suite of Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)
servers, clients, utilities and development tools. LDAP is an Internet
standard directory service protocol that can be used stand-alone, or as a
front end to an X.500 directory. LDAP is defined by RFCs 1777 through
1779.

OpenLDAP is derived from the University of Michigan LDAP release 3.3 and
is distributed under a Perl-style "Artistic License".

This is the server portion of OpenLDAP, it provides the server as well as
various administrative binaries.

Note: if using the MDB backend, you *must* configure the database
environment with the "writemap" flag, e.g. "olcDbEnvFlags: writemap" in
slapd-config(5).

	aci	enable the *experimental* ACI dynamic access control
