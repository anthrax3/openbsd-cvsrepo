@Drop separate OpenSSL flavour for FreeTDS. Change main package to using
OpenSSL rather than GnuTLS. Permit packages to be distributed. Bump shared
library versions to make sure they get updated.

As researched by jasper@@, the GPL has a special exception when something
depends on software provided with the base OS, so it *is* ok for us to
distribute this.

This is preferred over using GnuTLS because GnuTLS pulls in a pthread
dependency; pthread overrides libc functions, so it is necessary
that a program using this is itself linked with pthread, causing a
problem if you want to use the FreeTDS library to connect to servers
using encryption from programs which aren't themselves linked with
pthread (e.g. /usr/sbin/httpd with mod_php, or perl with DBD::Sybase).

@FreeTDS is a set of LGPL-licensed libraries that allow your programs
to natively talk to Microsoft SQL Server and Sybase databases.

Technically speaking, FreeTDS is an open source implementation of
the TDS (Tabular Data Stream) protocol used by these databases for
their own clients. It supports many different flavors of the protocol
and three APIs to access it. Additionally FreeTDS works with other
software such as Perl and PHP, providing access from those languages
as well.

FreeTDS has many possible uses. It has been used by Unix/Linux
webservers to present data stored in SQL Server to the web, to port
SQL Server database code from NT to Unix, to import data into SQL
Server from a Unix source, and to provide database access on platforms
(such as realtime systems) that have no native drivers.

@update to freetds 0.91; add an openssl flavour (see README for details),
remove msdblib flavour (with @@pkgpath to handle updates): this is not
really worth a separate flavour; just define MSDBLIB when building your
applications if you require this behaviour.

FLAVORS:
openssl   use OpenSSL instead of GnuTLS for encrypted connections.
          Avoids uthread problems but may not be redistributed; see README.
