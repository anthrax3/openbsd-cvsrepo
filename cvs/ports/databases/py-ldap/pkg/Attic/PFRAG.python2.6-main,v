@- drop python2.5 flavour of these "special" packages and add
@@pkgpath markers; from ajacoutot@@

- tweak from me: @@pkgpath markers for these go in PFRAG.python2.6-*
files rather than straight in PLIST-*, so that they are only added
to 2.6 packages, otherwise pkg_add -u will see that either 2.4 or
2.6 versions are valid updates and will have to ask every time,
ok ajacoutot@@
