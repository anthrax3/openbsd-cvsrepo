@Don't install a default database with an empty root password. From now on,
the user has to create the initial database himself.

Inspired by mbalmer@@s change to postgresql-server.

Additionally: Don't remove the databases when mysql-server is deinstalled
via 'pkg_delete -c'.

The mysql-server package doesn't initialize a default database.
Please run ${PREFIX}/bin/mysql_install_db to create one.

- The port has switched back to using native threads. Only tested and known to work on i386. For everything else the port is currently marked BROKEN until the appropriate architectures are tested. Do not even try this if you're not running -current libc_r.
- As suggested by Marc Espie, make symlink for the MySQL client library in lib/ to eliminate the need for adding lib/mysql to the shlib dir path. Porters have to be careful and ensure autoconf scripts do not arbitrarily enable MySQL support after this change.

- Also split the package into client and a server sub-package which
depends on the client portion. This allows for adding/removing the server
without needing to remove ports that might be dependent on the client
portion.
- innodb FLAVOR goes away and is replaced with the max FLAVOR like the
real MySQL distribution which gives us both Berkeley DB and InnoDB tables
for transaction support.
