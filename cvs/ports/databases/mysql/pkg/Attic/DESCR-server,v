@MySQL is a multi-threaded SQL database with a command syntax very similar
to mSQL.

This is the server portion of MySQL, it provides the MySQL server as well 
as various administrative binaries.

@- Don't mark the whole port BROKEN, only the -server subpackage. Enable
this port on sparc.
- Set CXX=${CC} to get rid of libstdc++ in order to improve stability
under heavy load; From: FreeBSD.
- Build mysqld statically by default, enable InnoDB by default too.
- Replace max FLAVOR with bdb FLAVOR and only enable it on i386 for now
until it can be tested on other archs.
- Add comment to MySQL to indicate that this install of MySQL is from the
OpenBSD port/package.
- Add RUN_DEPENDS on p5-Msql-Mysql for some of the Perl-based MySQL
scripts.
- Set the mysql account to be apart of the daemon login class.

- Also split the package into client and a server sub-package which
depends on the client portion. This allows for adding/removing the server
without needing to remove ports that might be dependent on the client
portion.
- innodb FLAVOR goes away and is replaced with the max FLAVOR like the
real MySQL distribution which gives us both Berkeley DB and InnoDB tables
for transaction support.
