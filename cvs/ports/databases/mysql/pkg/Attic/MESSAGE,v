@upgrade to MySQL 3.23.38

- Also split the package into client and a server sub-package which
depends on the client portion. This allows for adding/removing the server
without needing to remove ports that might be dependent on the client
portion.
- innodb FLAVOR goes away and is replaced with the max FLAVOR like the
real MySQL distribution which gives us both Berkeley DB and InnoDB tables
for transaction support.
