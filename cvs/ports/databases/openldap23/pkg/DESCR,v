@OpenLDAP is a suite of Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)
servers, clients, utilities and development tools. LDAP is an Internet
standard directory service protocol that can be used stand-alone, or as a
front end to an X.500 directory. LDAP is defined by RFCs 1777 through
1779.

OpenLDAP is derived from the University of Michigan LDAP release 3.3 and
is distributed under a Perl-style "Artistic License".

This is the server portion of OpenLDAP, it provides the server as well as
various administrative binaries.
