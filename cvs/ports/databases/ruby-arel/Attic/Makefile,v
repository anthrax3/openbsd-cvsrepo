@Remove www/ruby-rails and dependencies.  The current version is
out of date and subject to serious security vulnerabilities, updating
it causes a lot of ports churn for little benefit, and nobody has
offered to maintain it.

1.1.1.1
log
@Import ruby-arel, one of the dependencies for Rails 3.

Arel is a Relational Algebra for Ruby. It 1) simplifies the generation
complex of SQL queries and it 2) adapts to various RDBMS systems. It is
intended to be a framework framework; that is, you can build your own
ORM with it, focusing on innovative object and collection modeling as
opposed to database compatibility and query generation.
