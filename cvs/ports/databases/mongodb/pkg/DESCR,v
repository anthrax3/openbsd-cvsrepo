1.2
log
@Re-enable mongodb. Regress tests bomb out part-way with an assertion (noted
in DESCR with a suggestion that users check carefully for themselves) but it
works well enough for afresh1 and myself to run the UniFi controller software
and for bmercer. At the very least the BROKEN text isn't accurate any more
for this version. Roll PFRAG.shared into PLIST while there.

OK gsoares (who suggests updating to 2.4.9 which I haven't done here but
might try later).

text
@MongoDB (from "humongous") is an open source, high-performance,
schema-free, document-oriented database written in the C++ programming
language.

Note that some regression tests do fail in this port, so carefully check
whether it is reliable for your use case.
