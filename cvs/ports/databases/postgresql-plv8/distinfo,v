@Add postgresql-plv8 1.3.0

PLV8 is a shared library that provides a PostgreSQL procedual language
powered by V8 JavaScript Engine. With this program you can write in
JavaScript your function that is callable from SQL.

Supported features are:

* Functions can receive any arguments, and return a value or set of
  records.
* Execute any SQL commands with built-in plv8.execute() function.
* Automatic data conversion between PostgreSQL and JavaScript,
  including string, numbers, timestamps, arrays, and records.
* Records are converted to JSON which keys are column names.
* Other types are converted to strings.
* Partial support to write TRIGGER handlers.
* EXTENSION support.
* CoffeeScript and LiveScript support.
