@Resque is a Redis-backed Ruby library for creating background jobs,
placing those jobs on multiple queues, and processing them later.
Background jobs can be any Ruby class or module that responds to
perform. Your existing classes can easily be converted to background
jobs or you can create new classes specifically to do work. Or, you can
do both.

Resque is heavily inspired by DelayedJob and is comprised of three parts:

  * Ruby library for creating, querying, and processing jobs
  * Rake task for starting a worker which processes jobs
  * Sinatra app for monitoring queues, jobs, and workers.

The ruby-resque package does not install redis by default since it can use
a Redis server on a different host. To install redis: pkg_add redis
