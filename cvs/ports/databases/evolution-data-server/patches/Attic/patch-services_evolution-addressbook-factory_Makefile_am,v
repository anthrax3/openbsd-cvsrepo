1.2
log
@Move back to using libgnome-keyring. There is a very nasty crash with it
but at least it'll get us a chance to hunt for it instead of hiding it with
libsecret which fails in the same way but does not crash.

1.1
log
@Our binutils from paleolithic age exports private symbols which made
libgnome-keyring and gcr dump cores everywhere because of clashing
symbols. Merge libsecret support from upstream to have e-d-s use that
instead of libgnome-keyring.
