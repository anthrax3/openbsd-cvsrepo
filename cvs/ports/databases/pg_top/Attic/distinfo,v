@Remove pg_top; marked BROKEN since Apr 2014, and still no interest in
fixing (including me).  Requires adjusting to various API/ABI changes
since, cherry-picking from top(1) and then some.

@mark as BROKEN.  while the current version builds, it doesn't report a
thing mildly useful outside of the core dumps.  while upstream took all
the local patches and eventually released 3.7.0, it remains completely
unreliable - at least update to 3.7.0 to aid in tracking down the
machine.c bits that need to be addressed.

ok sthen on marking this BROKEN

@import pg_top

pg_top is 'top' for PostgreSQL.  It is derived from Unix Top.  Similar
to top, pg_top allows you to monitor PostgreSQL processes.  It also
allows you to:

    * View currently running SQL statement of a process.
    * View query plan of a currently running SELECT statement.
    * View locks held by a process.
    * View user table statistics.
    * View user index statistics

man page suggestion from sthen - thanks!

feedback and ok merdely
