@iODBC (intrinsic Open Database Connectivity) driver manager
is compatible with ODBC 2.x specification and performs exactly
same jobs of ODBC 2.x driver manager(i.e. driver loading, 
Parameters and function sequence checking, driver's function 
Invoking, etc.). Any ODBC driver works with ODBC 2.0 driver 
Manager will also work with iODBC driver manager and vice versa. 

Applications (using ODBC function calls) linked with 
iODBC driver manager will be able to simultaneously access 
different type of data sources within one process through 
suitable iODBC drivers.
