1.1
log
@Set default MariaDB config files to use bind-address=127.0.0.1, partly because
localhost is a safer default, and partly because otherwise it binds to an IPv6
socket (::) and OpenBSD deliberately doesn't allow v4 connections to those,
so people who do want (v4) network connections have trouble too. Add a comment
explaining use of 0.0.0.0 to listen to any IPv4 interface.

ok juanfra@@ pea@@ giovanni@@, ok jcs@@ on an earlier version (only change in the
new one was adding a comment), dhill likes it too
