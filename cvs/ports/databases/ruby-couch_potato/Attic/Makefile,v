@Remove www/ruby-rails and dependencies.  The current version is
out of date and subject to serious security vulnerabilities, updating
it causes a lot of ports churn for little benefit, and nobody has

1.8
log
@REVISION bump all ruby ports due to a change in the pkgspec.
Previously, we were using ruby->=1.8,<=1.9, instead of
ruby->=1.8,<1.9.  While this wouldn't cause an issue, since
our ruby-1.9.2 package isn't included in ruby->=1.8,<=1.9,
it's still wrong and should be fixed.  This also fixes the
following minor issues:

Switch from using FLAVOR to MODRUBY_FLAVOR for *_DEPENDS.
Currently we don't have a ruby port that uses FLAVORs that
would differ from MODRUBY_FLAVOR, but it's possible we will
in the future.

Switch from BASE_PKGPATH to BUILD_PKGPATH in a few cases in
REGRESS_DEPENDS.  This probably is not strictly necessary, but
BUILD_PKGPATH is used in more cases, so it is good for
consistency.

Switch to new style *_DEPENDS, with the version specification
at the end.  The remaining cases where this is not done is
because a specific version is used.

Some FULLPKGNAME added to REGRESS_DEPENDS, to make sure that if
the old version is installed when you run a regress test, it
will install the new version first.

Some conversion of spaces to tabs for consistency.

@Bump all ruby ports not already handled.

In the upgrade from ruby 1.8.6 to 1.8.7, the PLISTs changed
due to differences in how RDoc processes files.

This also has a number of changes to the regress tests to
work with the changes to devel/ruby-rake.  It moves most of
the regress tests to use MODRUBY_REGRESS.

@Initial import of ruby-couch_potato-0.2.8.

The goal of Couch Potato is to create a minimal framework in order
to store and retrieve Ruby objects to/from CouchDB and create
and query views.

It follows the document/view/querying semantics established by
CouchDB and won't try to mimic ActiveRecord behavior in any way
as that IS BAD.

Lastly Couch Potato aims to provide a seamless integration
with Ruby on Rails, e.g. routing, form helpers etc.
