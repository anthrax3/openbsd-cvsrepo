@pgBadger is a PostgreSQL log analyzer built for speed with fully
detailed reports from your PostgreSQL log file. It's a single and small
Perl script that aims to replace and out-perform the old PHP script
pgFouine.

pgBadger is written in pure Perl language. It uses a Javascript library
draw graphs so that you don't need additional Perl modules or any
other package to install. Furthermore, this library gives us additional
features, such as zooming.

pgBadger is able to autodetect your log file format (syslog, stderr or
csvlog). It is designed to parse huge log files, as well as gzip, zip or
bzip2 compressed files.
