@PostgreSQL RDBMS client applications, libraries and include files
for database administration, maintenance and integration with other
applications.

The OpenBSD PostgreSQL port build produces several packages:

* postgresql-client-${VERSION} - client package
  Client-side applications, headers and libraries.

* postgresql-server-${VERSION} - server package
  Contains additional files needed for performing backend server
  functions - such as providing the database server itself.

* postgresql-docs-${VERSION} - documentation
  Additional documentation: FAQs, READMEs; PostgreSQL manuals in
  HTML format: Administrator's Guide, Programmer's Manual, PostgreSQL
  Tutorial and User's Guide and Integrated Documentation package
  contains all the above documentation.

@Update to PostgreSQL 7.4.3

Changes in the package layout means that there is now a -client and
-server subpackage, and users no longer need to decide which, as
the -server depends on the -client, just like the sane cases in
mysql and openldap.

Other changes include:

* Removal of the tcl FLAVOR until someone with more tcl/tk knowledge
can make it work correctly.

* The INSTALL-server script now created a _postgresql user and group
if they don't already exist, and also a default database in
/var/postgresql if that directory also doesn't exist.

* The port is marked for NO_SHARED_ARCHS as the -server subpackage
needs shared lib support to build.

* The port will build with spinlocks disabled on hppa until someone
can check and test this problem more closely.

Built and checked on i386, sparc64, amd64, macppc (waiting for regress
test feedback).

Dependent packages will be updated after this commit, shortly.

Packages can be built with additional FLAVORs:

* tcl
  PostgreSQL built with TCL/TK interfaces.  Provides TCL/TK language
  interfaces to Postgres backends; includes pgaccess - Postgres
  graphical interactive client.  This FLAVOR requires lang/tcl/8.3
  and x11/tk/8.3 packages.
       
* odbc
  PostgreSQL built with ODBC (Open Data Base Connectivity) driver
  package You need to install some driver manager to use it. You
  can use iODBC (intrinsic Open Database Connectivity) driver manager
  can be found in databases/iodbc directory in your OpenBSD ports
  tree.

* no_locale
  Remove LOCALE support. It is included by default.

* no_ssl
  Remove SSL/TLS support. It is included by default.

@Upgrade to postgresql 7.1. ok'd espie@@

* The package is now called `postgresql' and not `pgsql'.

* The default user that is suggested for the admin account is also
  `postgresql'. This will work with OpenBSD-current with long username
  support. If anything breaks please report to the maintainers.

* pgwrap is no longer shipped or supported

* Please note, you will HAVE TO BACKUP your old data if you are
  upgrading from a previous release of postgresql. Do this before
  removing the old pgsql package.

From the announcement last weekend:

Key New Features and Capabilities of Version 7.1 Include:

* Write-ahead Log (WAL) increases data integrity and processing
speed. To maintain database consistency in case of an operating
system crash, previous releases of PostgreSQL have forced all all
data modifications to disk before each transaction commit. With
WAL, only one log file must be flushed to disk, greatly improving
performance. (Tech note: can eliminate use of -F in to disable disk
flushes)

* TOAST (The Oversized-Attribute Storage Technique) Past releases
had compiled-in row length limit typically between 8Kb & 32Kb. This
restriction made storage of long text fields difficult, cumbersome
and slow. TOAST enables rows of any length while maintaing the high
performance PostgreSQL users have come to expect.

* SQL92 Outer Joins are now supported. (Tech note: eliminates the
UNION/NOT IN workaround)

* 64-bit C Language Function Manager support The previous C function
manager did not handle support 64-bit CPU's (e.g. Alpha, Sun,
Itanium). (Tech note: This change should not impact existing custom
functions developed for past versions, but performance will be
improved through rewriting to use the new call interface.)

* Complex Queries that are better, stronger and faster Many complex
queries were unsupported in previous releases. With v7.1 combinations
of views, aggregates, UNION, LIMIT, cursors, subqueries, and inherited
tables are enabled. Inherited tables are now accessed by default,
and subqueries in FROM are now supported.

PostgreSQL is a robust, next-generation, Object-Relational DBMS (ORDBMS), 
derived from the Berkeley Postgres database management system.  While 
PostgreSQL retains the powerful object-relational data model, rich data types 
and easy extensibility of Postgres, it replaces the PostQuel query language 
with an extended subset of SQL.

The original Postgres code was the effort of many graduate students, 
undergraduate students, and staff programmers working under the direction of 
Professor Michael Stonebraker at the University of California, Berkeley. In 
1995, Andrew Yu and Jolly Chen took on the task of converting the DBMS query 
language to SQL and created a new database system which came to known as 
Postgres95. Many others contributed to the porting, testing, debugging and 
enhancement of the Postgres95 code. As the code improved, and 1995 faded into 
memory, PostgreSQL was born.

PostgreSQL development is presently being performed by a team of Internet 
developers who are now responsible for all current and future development. The 
development team coordinator is Marc G. Fournier (scrappy@@PostgreSQL.ORG). 
Support is available from the PostgreSQL developer/user community through the 
support mailing list (questions@@PostgreSQL.ORG).
