@add no_tcl flavor, inspired by a patch from pierre-yves ritsch

text
@SQLite is a C library that implements an embeddable SQL database engine.
Programs that link with the SQLite library can have SQL database access
without running a separate RDBMS process. The distribution comes with a
standalone command-line access program (sqlite) that can be used to
administer an SQLite database and which serves as an example of how to
use the SQLite library.

Flavors:
	no_tcl	- disables TCL-based regression tests

@Import of sqlite, a public-domain in-process SQL engine:

    SQLite is a C library that implements an embeddable SQL database engine.
    Programs that link with the SQLite library can have SQL database access
    without running a separate RDBMS process. The distribution comes with a
    standalone command-line access program (sqlite) that can be used to
    administer an SQLite database and which serves as an example of how to
    use the SQLite library. SQLite is not a client library used to connect to
    a big database server. SQLite is the server. The SQLite library reads and
    writes directly to and from the database files on disk.
