1.2
log
@update to 0.9.2

* When no servers have been registered, automatically open the
  "Register Server" dialog on startup.

* Fixed a minor bug which didn't automatically set the correct
  default values for some features introduced in the prevous version
  when registering a new server.

* Added an "Unlimited" option for the Automatic SELECT Limit option.

* Enabled plugin support.

* Fixed a bug compiling MySQLCC with Qt < 3.1.0.

* Fixed a bug which automatically used the default unix socket when
  "localhost" was defined as the servers hostname.  It now uses the
  unix socket if the hostname is "localhost" and the port is 3306.

@update to mysqlcc-0.8.6

This program will now be referred to as "MySQL Control Center", not
"MyCC". The name of the executable file has changed from "MyCC" to
"mysqlcc" and so have all the config directories.
