@DBIx::Connector provides a simple interface for fast and safe DBI
connection and transaction management. Connecting to a database can be
expensive; you don't want your application to re-connect every time you
need to run a query. The efficient thing to do is to hang on to a
database handle to maintain a connection to the database in order to
minimize that overhead. DBIx::Connector lets you do that without having
to worry about dropped or corrupted connections.
