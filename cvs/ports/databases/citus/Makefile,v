@Import citus 6.2.2.

Citus horizontally scales PostgreSQL across multiple machines using
sharding and replication. Its query engine parallelizes incoming SQL
queries across these servers to enable human real-time (less than a
second) responses on large datasets.

Citus extends the underlying database rather than forking it, which
gives developers and enterprises the power and familiarity of a
traditional relational database. As an extension, Citus supports new
PostgreSQL releases, allowing users to benefit from new features while
maintaining compatibility with existing PostgreSQL tools.
