@Update Soprano to 2.9.0. Altough not formally required by KDE4 SC, it
behaves better with KDE4 PIM.

Some regression tests still fail, but mostly due to fetching data from
external URLs and such.

@Soprano (formally known as QRDF) is a library which provides a nice Qt
interface to RDF storage solutions. It has a modular structure which 
allows to  replace the actual RDF storage implementation used.

* Full context (i.e. named graph) support
* Plugin structure for extensibility
* Server and client lib which allows a simple remote Soprano server
* Simple sopranod server application
* Simple sopranocmd tool to perform commands on models in a Soprano server
* Rule-based Forward inference engine
* Full-text index based on CLucene which indexes all literal 
  statements (i.e. those statements with a literal object node)
* Hierarchical architecture which allows to stack multiple filter models
  on top of an RDF storage
