@make space for a split import of db v3/v4
@

@Berkeley DB is a programmatic toolkit that provides fast, reliable,
scalable, and mission-critical database support to software developers.

Berkeley DB provides data management services for some of the most
demanding high-end server applications in the world. Vendors of
industry-leading messaging, directory, billing and provisioning servers as
well as the biggest portal, ASP and commerce sites on the Internet rely on
Berkeley DB. Berkeley DB's high performance and scalability support
thousands of simultaneous users working on databases as large as 256
terabytes.

At the same time, Berkeley DB's small footprint, in-process execution
model, simple function-call API and low administrative overhead make it
ideal for use in embedded systems. Vendors of telecommunications switches,
routers and wired and wireless network gateways choose Berkeley DB to
manage critical information in their products.

@ o bump NEED_VERSION
 o add tcl and c++ flavors
 o use PFRAG.<flavor> instead of PLIST-<flavor>
 o make proper .so.MAJOR.MINOR dynlibs with makefile and configure
   patches
 o fix reference to shared libraries in a few tcl test scripts
 o use a patch to makefile.in instead of a port makefile tweak
   to create libdb3.a instead of libdb-3.1.a
 o sync libtool patches
 o remove some sleepycat's marketing speech from DESCR
 o take over MAINTAINER
 o clarify license a bit
lots of thanks to Nils Nordman <nino@@nforced.com> and naddy@@ for
running the huge test set. (it takes days.)

In November of 1999, Sleepycat Software released Version 3.0 of
Berkeley DB.  The 3.X code line includes major new features, some
of which require a database format upgrade. Release 3 also modified
the Berkeley DB API.  Applications developed using version 2 of
Berkeley DB will need to be upgraded in order to use release 3.X.

@- update to 3.1.17
- FAKE, IS_INTERACTIVE -> FLAVOR
- use shared libs again on arches that support it (req'd for java)
