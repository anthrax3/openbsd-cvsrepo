@import puppetdb 4.1.0

PuppetDB is the fast, scalable, and reliable data warehouse for Puppet.
It caches data generated by Puppet, and gives you advanced features at
awesome speed with a powerful API.

the existing databases/puppetdb port only works against puppet 3; puppetdb 4
works against puppet 4.
