log
@Import garcon 0.1.5

This is garcon, a freedesktop.org compliant menu implementation based
on GLib and GIO. It was started as a complete rewrite of the former
Xfce menu library called libxfce4menu, which, in contrast to garcon,
was lacking menu merging features essential for loading menus modified
with menu editors.

Installs the xfce-applications.menu file which was previously in
xfdesktop, hence @@conflict with xfdesktop-<4.7.0.
