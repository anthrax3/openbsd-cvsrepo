@Winter cleanup of the Xfce ports:

- use LIBTOOL_FLAGS=--tag=disable-static to avoid building useless
  static libs.
- add a MODXFCE_PURGE_LA variable holding the list of dirs to purge from
  libtool archive useless files.
- add a MODXFCE4_post-install hook in xfce4.port.mk to purge the la files.
  This requires  bsd.port.mk r1.1201.
- remove --disable-linker-opts now that --as-needed seems to work fine
- fix WANTLIB (mostly adding harfbuzz icudata icule icuuc in lots of
  places)
- update PLISTs: remove @@comment'ed static/la files, redundant dirs

@Second and final pass at converting Xfce panel plugins to xfce4.port.mk.
Bump PKGNAMEs, regen PLISTs with @@bin, fix licence markers, tidy up
LIB_DEPENDS/WANTLIB around, and while here remove an unneeded patch in
xfce4-xkb. The only remaining plugin to fix/update is xfce4-wavelan.
