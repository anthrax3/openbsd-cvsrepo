@Whisker Menu is an alternate application launcher for Xfce. When you
open it you are shown a list of applications you have marked as
favorites. You can browse through all of your installed applications by
clicking on the category buttons on the side. Top level categories make
browsing fast, and simple to switch between. Additionally, Whisker Menu

@Import xfce4-whiskermenu 1.3.0.

Whisker Menu is an alternate application launcher for Xfce. When you
open it you are shown a list of applications you have marked as
favorites. You can browse through all of your installed applications by
clicking on the category buttons on the side. Top level categories make
browsing fast, and simple to switch between. Additionally, Whisker Menu
keeps a list of the last ten applications that you've launched from it.

See http://gottcode.org/xfce4-whiskermenu-plugin/ for details.

User switching and menu editing disabled by default, since
gdmflexiserver wont work on OpenBSD, and we don't have menulibre in
ports yet.
