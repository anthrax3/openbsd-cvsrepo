@xfce4-panel is the panel of the XFce Desktop Environment.  It is modeled
slightly after the CDE panel and, of course, previous versions of xfce.
The panel provides program launchers, detachable, non-hierarchical menus
(easier to read at a glance), and several panel 'plugins' like a clock and a
pager.  Additional plugins may be installed separately.
