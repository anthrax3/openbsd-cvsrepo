1.2
log
@Remove xfce4-bglist-editor, it is superseded by xfdesktop since xfce 4.4.
Also remove xfce4-lua-graph, it is abandoned upstream since 2005 and no
release is planned to make it work with newer xfce.

Both were marked broken since some months, the only remaining broken one
is xfce4-wavelan, but a pending update will fix it.

No objection from ajacoutot@@ and brad@@
