@wallpaper setting utility for X

The xwallpaper utility allows you to set image files as your X wallpaper. JPEG,
PNG, and XPM file formats are supported, all of them being configurable and
therefore no fixed dependencies.

The wallpaper is also advertised to programs which support semi-transparent
backgrounds.
