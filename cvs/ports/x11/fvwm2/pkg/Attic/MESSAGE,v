Notes for XFree86 3.3/3.3.1 and LANG=ja_JP.EUC:

There are some bug (?) in already released XFree86 based on X11R6.3, i.e.,
XFree86 3.3 and XFree86 3.3.1, when X client runs under LANG=ja_JP.EUC.

If you wanna use this fvwm2 with LANG=ja_JP.EUC (which means "run fvwm2,
with environment variable 'LANG' is set to 'ja_JP.EUC' to enable to display
Japanese Kanji/Hiragana/Katakana characters"), apply following patch to
/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/locale/ja/XLC_LOCALE (or equivalent).

@Import of fvwm-2.2.5

Fvwm is a window manager for X, which provides a virtual/multiple
disjoint desktop, a 3D look for windows decorations, shaped/color
icons. It gives a very good emulation of mwm. A nice button-bar
can be used to provide convenient access to frequently used
functions of programs.

Flavors:
	rplay	- build with audio/rplay and provide sound support
	debug	- turn on debugging messages

WWW: http://www.fvwm.org/

Will co-exist with the fvwm in XF4, with the idea of being on the
bleeding edge, with more extras built in and flavors for choice.
Per discussion with todd@@
