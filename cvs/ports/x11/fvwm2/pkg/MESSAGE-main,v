In order to use fvwm2 as your window manager, you must change your
.xinitrc or .xsession appropriately and add a line similar to the
following:

	exec ${PREFIX}/bin/fvwm2

Icons have been installed into ${PREFIX}/share/pixmaps/fvwm, and a system
wide configuration has been put in ${PREFIX}/share/fvwm/system.fvwm2rc.
To use your own configuration, copy ${PREFIX}/share/fvwm/system.fvwm2rc
to ~/.fvwm2rc and edit it as appropriate.
