@Rework Qt5 documentation handling:

  * Move share/qt5/doc/* in qtbase from -main to a separate subpackage,
    -global, which (as a bonus) "owns" share/doc/qt5/ directory;

  * Move FOO.index files from -html to a separate subpackage, -docindex,
    and make 'em depend on qtbase,-global;

  * Make DEP,-docindex automatically added as BDEP for each DEP in
    LDEP and BDEP mentioned for -main;

  * Make it clear that building -qch without -html is impossible;

While there, fixed a few minor issues.

This make at least qtenginio,-html build correctly, which failed before
due to missing .index files during qdoc run. Initial report from kili@@.

@The core Qt Gui library by default supports reading and writing image files of
the most common file formats: PNG, JPEG, BMP, GIF and a few more, see the
Reading and Writing Image Files section in QImage class reference.  The Qt Image
Formats add-on module provides optional support for other image file formats.

The file format support is provided transparently, through plugins for Qt's
image I/O system. As such, this module provides no API of its own. Instead, the
functionality is accessed in the same way as other image I/O in Qt: through
QImage::load() and QImage::save(). Or, for more detailed control, through
QImageReader and QImageWriter.

This package contains QtImageFormats documentation index.
