@Rework the process of building Qt5 documentation:

Now all documentation is built using a separate port using
the --single-exec option of qdoc. This gaves significant speedup
as well as fixing quiet a few interlinking problems.

All -qch, -html and -docindex subpackages of Qt modules ports are
removed. The qt5-html and qt5-qch are now provided by x11/qt5/docs
instead of meta/qt5, thus REVISION set from the start.

This commit should fix problems with building Qt5 documentation
that people started seeing after switching to Clang. We also could
zap some interdependencies between Qt5 modules as well, but that's
a different story.

@The core Qt Gui library by default supports reading and writing image files of
the most common file formats: PNG, JPEG, BMP, GIF and a few more, see the
Reading and Writing Image Files section in QImage class reference.  The Qt Image
Formats add-on module provides optional support for other image file formats.

The file format support is provided transparently, through plugins for Qt's
image I/O system. As such, this module provides no API of its own. Instead, the
functionality is accessed in the same way as other image I/O in Qt: through
QImage::load() and QImage::save(). Or, for more detailed control, through
QImageReader and QImageWriter.

This package contains actual libraries to be used by apps.
