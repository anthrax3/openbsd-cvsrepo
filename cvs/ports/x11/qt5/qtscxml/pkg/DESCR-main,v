@The Qt SCXML module provides functionality to create state machines from SCXML
files. This includes both dynamically creating state machines (loading the SCXML
file and instantiating states and transitions) and generating a C++ file that
has a class implementing the state machine. It also contains functionality to
support data models and executable content.

This package contains actual libraries to be used by apps.
