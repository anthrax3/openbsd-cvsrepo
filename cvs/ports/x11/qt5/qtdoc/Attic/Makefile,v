@Rework the process of building Qt5 documentation:

Now all documentation is built using a separate port using
the --single-exec option of qdoc. This gaves significant speedup
as well as fixing quiet a few interlinking problems.

All -qch, -html and -docindex subpackages of Qt modules ports are
removed. The qt5-html and qt5-qch are now provided by x11/qt5/docs
instead of meta/qt5, thus REVISION set from the start.

This commit should fix problems with building Qt5 documentation
that people started seeing after switching to Clang. We also could
zap some interdependencies between Qt5 modules as well, but that's
a different story.

@Update from Qt 5.6.2 (LTS) to Qt 5.9.1 (LTS).

Tested with both GCC and CLang (less through).

This forces updating x11/py-qt5, which forces update of devel/py-sip,
which forces update of x11/py-qt4, but, thankfully, no breakage detected.

@Rework Qt5 documentation handling:

  * Move share/qt5/doc/* in qtbase from -main to a separate subpackage,
    -global, which (as a bonus) "owns" share/doc/qt5/ directory;

  * Move FOO.index files from -html to a separate subpackage, -docindex,
    and make 'em depend on qtbase,-global;

  * Make DEP,-docindex automatically added as BDEP for each DEP in
    LDEP and BDEP mentioned for -main;

  * Make it clear that building -qch without -html is impossible;

While there, fixed a few minor issues.

This make at least qtenginio,-html build correctly, which failed before
due to missing .index files during qdoc run. Initial report from kili@@.
