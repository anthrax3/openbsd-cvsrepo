1.2
log
@Rework Qt5 documentation handling:

  * Move share/qt5/doc/* in qtbase from -main to a separate subpackage,
    -global, which (as a bonus) "owns" share/doc/qt5/ directory;

  * Move FOO.index files from -html to a separate subpackage, -docindex,
    and make 'em depend on qtbase,-global;

  * Make DEP,-docindex automatically added as BDEP for each DEP in
    LDEP and BDEP mentioned for -main;

  * Make it clear that building -qch without -html is impossible;

While there, fixed a few minor issues.

This make at least qtenginio,-html build correctly, which failed before
due to missing .index files during qdoc run. Initial report from kili@@.
