1.2
log
@Update from Qt 5.6.2 (LTS) to Qt 5.9.1 (LTS).

Tested with both GCC and CLang (less through).

This forces updating x11/py-qt5, which forces update of devel/py-sip,
which forces update of x11/py-qt4, but, thankfully, no breakage detected.

@Qt Network Authorization provides a set of APIs that enable Qt applications
to obtain limited access to online accounts and HTTP services without exposing
users' passwords.

Currently, the supported authorization protocol is OAuth 1 & 2.

This is a part of upcoming Qt 5.9.
