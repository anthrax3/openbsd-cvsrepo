@Rework the process of building Qt5 documentation:

Now all documentation is built using a separate port using
the --single-exec option of qdoc. This gaves significant speedup
as well as fixing quiet a few interlinking problems.

All -qch, -html and -docindex subpackages of Qt modules ports are
removed. The qt5-html and qt5-qch are now provided by x11/qt5/docs
instead of meta/qt5, thus REVISION set from the start.

This commit should fix problems with building Qt5 documentation
that people started seeing after switching to Clang. We also could
zap some interdependencies between Qt5 modules as well, but that's
a different story.

@Update from Qt 5.6.2 (LTS) to Qt 5.9.1 (LTS).

Tested with both GCC and CLang (less through).

This forces updating x11/py-qt5, which forces update of devel/py-sip,
which forces update of x11/py-qt4, but, thankfully, no breakage detected.

@The Qt Virtual Keyboard project provides an input framework and reference
keyboard frontend for Qt 5 on Linux Desktop/X11, Windows Desktop, and Boot2Qt
targets.

The input framework makes it easy to write custom input methods or to integrate
3rd party input engines. The input methods can be implemented in C++ or QML.

This is a part of upcoming Qt 5.9.
