@Effects are visual items that can be added to Qt Quick user interface as UI
components. To import the Qt Graphical Effects types, include the Qt
Graphical Effects module by adding the following statement to the QML file:

  import QtGraphicalEffects 1.0

To use the effects, simply add a specific effect declaration to the QML
scene and configure the effects properties. The source item type can be any
QML type, even video or another effect. Pipelining multiple effects together
is a simple way to create even more impressive output.

This package contains compiled QtGraphicalEffects documentation.
