@Rework Qt5 documentation handling:

  * Move share/qt5/doc/* in qtbase from -main to a separate subpackage,
    -global, which (as a bonus) "owns" share/doc/qt5/ directory;

  * Move FOO.index files from -html to a separate subpackage, -docindex,
    and make 'em depend on qtbase,-global;

  * Make DEP,-docindex automatically added as BDEP for each DEP in
    LDEP and BDEP mentioned for -main;

  * Make it clear that building -qch without -html is impossible;

While there, fixed a few minor issues.

This make at least qtenginio,-html build correctly, which failed before
due to missing .index files during qdoc run. Initial report from kili@@.

@Effects are visual items that can be added to Qt Quick user interface as UI
components. To import the Qt Graphical Effects types, include the Qt
Graphical Effects module by adding the following statement to the QML file:

  import QtGraphicalEffects 1.0

To use the effects, simply add a specific effect declaration to the QML
scene and configure the effects properties. The source item type can be any
QML type, even video or another effect. Pipelining multiple effects together
is a simple way to create even more impressive output.

This package contains QtGraphicalEffects documentation index.
