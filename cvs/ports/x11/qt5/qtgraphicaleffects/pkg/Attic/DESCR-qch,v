@Rework the process of building Qt5 documentation:

Now all documentation is built using a separate port using
the --single-exec option of qdoc. This gaves significant speedup
as well as fixing quiet a few interlinking problems.

All -qch, -html and -docindex subpackages of Qt modules ports are
removed. The qt5-html and qt5-qch are now provided by x11/qt5/docs
instead of meta/qt5, thus REVISION set from the start.

This commit should fix problems with building Qt5 documentation
that people started seeing after switching to Clang. We also could
zap some interdependencies between Qt5 modules as well, but that's
a different story.

@Effects are visual items that can be added to Qt Quick user interface as UI
components. To import the Qt Graphical Effects types, include the Qt
Graphical Effects module by adding the following statement to the QML file:

  import QtGraphicalEffects 1.0

To use the effects, simply add a specific effect declaration to the QML
scene and configure the effects properties. The source item type can be any
QML type, even video or another effect. Pipelining multiple effects together
is a simple way to create even more impressive output.

This package contains compiled QtGraphicalEffects documentation.
