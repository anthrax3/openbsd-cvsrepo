@Rework the process of building Qt5 documentation:

Now all documentation is built using a separate port using
the --single-exec option of qdoc. This gaves significant speedup
as well as fixing quiet a few interlinking problems.

All -qch, -html and -docindex subpackages of Qt modules ports are
removed. The qt5-html and qt5-qch are now provided by x11/qt5/docs
instead of meta/qt5, thus REVISION set from the start.

This commit should fix problems with building Qt5 documentation
that people started seeing after switching to Clang. We also could
zap some interdependencies between Qt5 modules as well, but that's
a different story.

@Qt Charts enables creating stylish, interactive, data centric user interfaces.
Qt Charts uses the Graphics View Framework for ease of integration. The chart
components can be used as QWidget or QGraphicsWidget objects or QML types.

This package contains QtCharts documentation index.

@Somehow I've missed this Qt5 module when preparing (not committed) 5.9.0
update. Let put it in now, and make future 5.9.1 commit churn smaller.
