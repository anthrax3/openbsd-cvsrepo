1.1.1.1
log
@Import new Qt5 offline documentation port.

Now all the documentation is built at once: much faster and allowing
interlinks between Qt modules to work better. This should also fix some
packaging issues people are seeing after switching to Clang (the reason
is still unknown, unfortunately).

To be linked to builds a bit later.
