@Qt is a cross-platform toolkit for developing applications,
mainly GUI-based.

There are some user documentation files in ${QT_DOC}, but
the main documentation is in the qt5-html package.

There is also a qt5-examples package, that contains tutorial, demos
simple example programs (source + binaries).

There's a debug version of the libraries: qt5-debug.

There are database plugins: qt5-mysql, qt5-postgresql, qt5-sqlite2 and
qt5-tds.

People who want to use Qt5 to compile applications outside the ports tree
should note that Qt5's installation conforms to OpenBSD habits, not
TrollTech's recommendations. Accordingly:
- libs are separated from includes.
- moc is installed as ${PREFIX}/bin/moc-qt5, in order not to conflict
  with other Qt versions.
- uic is installed as ${PREFIX}/bin/uic-qt5

Generally, it's just a question of invoking:

  env MOC=moc-qt5 UIC=uic-qt5 configure \
	--with-qt-includes=${PREFIX}/include/X11/qt5 \
	--with-qt-libraries=${PREFIX}/lib/qt5

... or, to force MOC/UIC in your make/gmake invocation:

  make MOC=moc-qt5 UIC=uic-qt5

will override the Makefile contents.

@Import Qt 5.3.2.

Qt is a full development framework with tools designed to streamline
the creation of applications and user interfaces for desktop,
embedded, and mobile platforms.

This port is not enabled yet, because some ports will pick up Qt5
instead of Qt4, breaking build. Those will be fixed separately soon.

There are some non-critical things left to do:

1. Support for OpenBSD sensors framework.
2. V4L2 support.
3. -L${LOCALBASE}/* could come before -L${WRKBUILD}/* when linking is
   done across Qt module boundaries. This means that builds of Qt 5.y
   while having Qt 5.x installed (x < y) will be busted.

Volunteers are welcome to come in and help fixing those problems.

Last note: don't even try to build "debug" FLAVOR unless you know
what you're doing and you have about 20GB of free space. You've
been warned.
