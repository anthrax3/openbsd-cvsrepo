1.2
log
@Update x11/qt5 to 5.4.1. Improvements included:

  * Builds fine when another version being installed;
  * Start building documentation, HTML generator bug was fixed (patch is
    waiting for inclusion upstream);

This update do NOT include QtWebEngine: it relies on building from
Chromium sources (bundled with Qt5) and is a real pain to proceed; so lets
concentrate on what we already have.

All dependant ports are checked by building and running.

@On OpenBSD, we override shared library versions. This breaks Qt-GTK
interaction, as found by Adam Wolk (thanks!).

Fix by stopping requiring exact major version of GTK+ libraries.
