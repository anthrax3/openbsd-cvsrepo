Unbreak linking to static libraries by providing exact paths when possible.

Particular problem: system version of leveldb gets picked up due to madness in -L.

@Import Qt 5.3.2.

Qt is a full development framework with tools designed to streamline
the creation of applications and user interfaces for desktop,
embedded, and mobile platforms.

This port is not enabled yet, because some ports will pick up Qt5
instead of Qt4, breaking build. Those will be fixed separately soon.

There are some non-critical things left to do:

1. Support for OpenBSD sensors framework.
2. V4L2 support.
3. -L${LOCALBASE}/* could come before -L${WRKBUILD}/* when linking is
   done across Qt module boundaries. This means that builds of Qt 5.y
   while having Qt 5.x installed (x < y) will be busted.

Volunteers are welcome to come in and help fixing those problems.

Last note: don't even try to build "debug" FLAVOR unless you know
what you're doing and you have about 20GB of free space. You've
been warned.
