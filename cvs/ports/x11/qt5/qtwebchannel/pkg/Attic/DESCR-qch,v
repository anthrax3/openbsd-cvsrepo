@Rework the process of building Qt5 documentation:

Now all documentation is built using a separate port using
the --single-exec option of qdoc. This gaves significant speedup
as well as fixing quiet a few interlinking problems.

All -qch, -html and -docindex subpackages of Qt modules ports are
removed. The qt5-html and qt5-qch are now provided by x11/qt5/docs
instead of meta/qt5, thus REVISION set from the start.

This commit should fix problems with building Qt5 documentation
that people started seeing after switching to Clang. We also could
zap some interdependencies between Qt5 modules as well, but that's
a different story.

@Qt WebChannel bridges the gap between Qt applications and HTML/JavaScript.

Qt WebChannel enables peer-to-peer communication between the host
(QML/C++ application) and the client (HTML/JavaScript application). The
transport mechanism is supported out of the box by the two popular web
engines, Qt WebKit 2 and Qt WebEngine (experimental). It works on all
browsers that support Qt WebSockets, enabling Qt WebChannel applications
to run in any JavaScript runtime. Additionally, a custom transport
mechanism can also be implemented using Qt WebSockets to support Qt
WebChannel-based communication.

The module provides a JavaScript library for seamless integration of C++
and QML applications with HTML/JavaScript clients. The client must use the
JavaScript library to access the serialized QObjects published by the host
applications.

This package contains compiled QtWebChannel documentation.
