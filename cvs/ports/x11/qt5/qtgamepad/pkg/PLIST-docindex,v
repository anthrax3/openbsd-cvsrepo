1.2
log
@Update from Qt 5.6.2 (LTS) to Qt 5.9.1 (LTS).

Tested with both GCC and CLang (less through).

This forces updating x11/py-qt5, which forces update of devel/py-sip,
which forces update of x11/py-qt4, but, thankfully, no breakage detected.

1.1.1.1
log
@A Qt 5 module that adds support for getting events from gamepad devices
on multiple platforms.

This module provides classes that can:
 - read input events from game controllers (Button and Axis events),
   both from C++ and Qt Quick (QML);
 - provide a queryable input state (by processing events);
 - provide key bindings.

This is a part of upcoming Qt 5.9.
