@Rework the process of building Qt5 documentation:

Now all documentation is built using a separate port using
the --single-exec option of qdoc. This gaves significant speedup
as well as fixing quiet a few interlinking problems.

All -qch, -html and -docindex subpackages of Qt modules ports are
removed. The qt5-html and qt5-qch are now provided by x11/qt5/docs
instead of meta/qt5, thus REVISION set from the start.

This commit should fix problems with building Qt5 documentation
that people started seeing after switching to Clang. We also could
zap some interdependencies between Qt5 modules as well, but that's
a different story.

@Qt Remote Objects (QtRO) is an inter-process communication (IPC) module
developed for Qt. The idea is to extend existing Qt's functionalities to enable
an easy exchange of information between processes or computers.

One of the key features of Qt to enable this is the distinction between an
objects API (defined by its Q_Property, Signals and Slots) and the
implementation of that API. The purpose of QtRO is to meet the expected API,
even if the true QObject is in a different process. A Slot called on a copy of
an object (called a Replica) is forwarded to the true object (called a Source)
for handling. Updates to the Source, either property changes or emitted Signals,
are forwarded to every Replica.

This package contains QtRemoteObjects HTML documentation.

This is a part of upcoming Qt 5.9.
