1.1.1.1
log
@The module enables a Qt application to support accessibility features such as
text-to-speech, which is useful for end-users who are visually challenged or
cannot access the application for whatever reason. The most common use case
where text-to-speech comes in handy is when the end-user is driving and cannot
attend the incoming messages on the phone.  In such a scenario, the messaging
application can read out the incoming message.

This is a part of upcoming Qt 5.9.
