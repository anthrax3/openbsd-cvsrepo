@Remove dirty patches now that ld.so's nodelete handling has been improved.

XXX Attempt to avoid an intermittent crash in ld.so when running vlc-cache-gen.
See https://marc.info/?t=145123666100001&r=1&w=2

The LD_PRELOAD alone seems to help i386 quite a lot, but doesn't do much
on amd64. But adding the LD_DEBUG=1 seems to improve things a lot there....

@Add a dirty hack with a combination of LD_PRELOAD and LD_DEBUG that seems
to at least reduce the number of segfaults/bus errors seen when running
vlc-cache-gen as part of the VLC build.

The LD_PRELOAD alone seems to help i386, but doesn't do much for amd64
The LD_DEBUG alone seems to help amd64, but doesn't do much for i386

Not nice, but this is getting to be a big problem in bulk builds (not
least because a bunch of kde4-land depends on this), so trying anything
that might help...

log
@Remove the LD_PRELOAD workarounds for vlc-cache-gen. I suspect this may have
been due to the recently-fixed ld.so bug with unloading/reloading that was
figured out with SDL2. Also something has changed very recently causing vlc
to fail on i386 ("lazy binding failed") if these patches are *in*.

If the segfaults recur we can figure something else out but I haven't hit
them in hundreds of vlc-cache-gen runs.

OK brad (maintainer).

Appears related to https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=752544
though in glib2 we do already have -Wl,nodelete when linking libgobject.

@use LD_PRELOAD for another instance of vlc-cache-gen which was intermittently
failing; same as patch-bin_Makefile_am r1.1
