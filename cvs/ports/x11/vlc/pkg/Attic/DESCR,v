@VLC (VideoLAN Client) is a highly portable multimedia player for various
audio and video formats (MPEG-1, MPEG-2, MPEG-4, DivX, mp3, ogg, ...) as
well as DVDs, and various streaming protocols.

As shipped, vlc cannot descramble DVDs.  There are a few DVDs out there
with no scramble protection.  However, vlc will recognize and use an
installed descrambling library (see converters/libdvd in the ports
tree).

On i386 vlc can use win32 codecs (see graphics/win32-codecs in the ports
tree) if they are installed and if the machdep.userldt sysctl is enabled,
e.g. by running:

# sysctl machdep.userldt=1

This value can be made permanent by editing /etc/sysctl.conf, see
sysctl.conf(5) for more details.

FLAVORs:
	no_web - don't build the mozilla plugin
