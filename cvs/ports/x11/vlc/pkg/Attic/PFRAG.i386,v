@- don't install the plugin which reads divx subtitles from a file.  it
  isn't built correctly which causes problems on macppc and it isn't
  popular/useful anyway.  this will be properly fixed "soon".
- remove NOT_FOR_ARCHS=powerpc as it seems to "work" on my ibook
  (to the extent that it can without accelerated video and problematic
   audio)
- use SED_PLIST, rather than the dirty FLAVOR+=${MACHINE_ARCH} hack, it
  makes the index entry look prettier.
- adjust PLIST accordingly, and also add the logo plugin (useless?)
- adjust LIB_DEPENDS for the liba52 change and logo plugin

thanks to drahn@@ for help, hints, & suggestions
