@Enlightenment is a window manager for the X Window System that is
designed to be powerful, extensible, configurable and pretty darned
good looking! It is one of the more graphically intense window
managers.

Enlightenment goes beyond managing windows by providing a useful
and appealing graphical shell from which to work. It is open in
design and instead of dictating a policy, allows the user to define
their own policy, down to every last detail.

What is a Windowmanager?  Strictly speaking, a Window Manager manages
windows - it is the Window Manager's task to arrange program windows on
screen in some defined fashion, and allow the user to move, resize, 
iconify, and otherwise manipulate these client windows, without the 
client programs needing to do this themselves.

Enlightenment goes beyond this, not just Managing Windows, but providing
a useful, good looking graphical shell from which to work.  It is open 
in design, and instead of dictating a policy it allows the user to 
define their own policy right down to the minute and infinitesimal 
details; from its functionality right on through to its looks.
