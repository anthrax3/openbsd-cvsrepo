log
@Import gnome-screensaver-3.0.0.

gnome-screensaver is a screen saver and locker that aims to have simple,
sane, secure defaults and be well integrated with the desktop.
It is designed to support:
    * the ability to lock down configuration settings
    * translation into many languages
    * user switching (not implemented under OpenBSD)
