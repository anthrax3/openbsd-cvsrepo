log
@Remove what I've merged.
@
text
@The package contains an implementation of the draft "Desktop
Menu Specification" from freedesktop.org for GNOME:

  http://www.freedesktop.org/Standards/menu-spec

Also contained here are the GNOME menu layout configuration
files, .directory files and assorted menu related utility programs.

1.1
log
@Shuffle things around so that the gnome3 directory is usable like
mystuff. README coming soon so anyone can start having 'fun' with gnome3
ports.
Also this will allow proper dependencies to be set from the start
instead of breaking half of the tree when GNOME3 is enabled.

discussed with an ok jasper@@
