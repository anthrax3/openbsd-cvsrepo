@Import seahorse-3.0.2.

Seahorse is a graphical interface for managing and using encryption
keys.  Currently it supports PGP keys (using GPG/GPGME) and SSH keys.
Its goal is to  provide an easy to use Key Management Tool, along with
an easy to use interface for encryption operations.
Seahorse is integrated into the GNOME Desktop Environment and allows
users to  perform operations from their regular applications, like
nautilus or gedit.
