@gedit is a small and lightweight UTF-8 text editor for the GNOME
environment.  gedit uses a Multiple Document Interface (MDI), which lets
you edit more than one document at the same time.

gedit supports most standard editing features, plus several not found in
your  average text editor (plugins being the most notable of these).
