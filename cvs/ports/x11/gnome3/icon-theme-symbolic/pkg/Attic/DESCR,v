@Shuffle things around so that the gnome3 directory is usable like
mystuff. README coming soon so anyone can start having 'fun' with gnome3
ports.
Also this will allow proper dependencies to be set from the start
instead of breaking half of the tree when GNOME3 is enabled.

@Purpose of this icon theme is to extend the base icon theme that follows
the Tango style guidelines for specific purposes. This would include
OSD messages, panel system/notification area, and possibly menu icons. 

Icons follow the naming specification, but have a -symbolic suffix, so
only applications specifically looking up these symbolic icons will
render them. If a -symbolic icon is missing, the app will fall back to
the regular name.
