@Shuffle things around so that the gnome3 directory is usable like
mystuff. README coming soon so anyone can start having 'fun' with gnome3
ports.
Also this will allow proper dependencies to be set from the start
instead of breaking half of the tree when GNOME3 is enabled.

@Import gnome-keyring-3.0.1.

gnome-keyring is a program that keep password and other secrets for
users. It is run as a daemon in the session, similar to ssh-agent, and
other applications can locate it by an environment variable.
 
The program can manage several keyrings, each with its own master
password, and there is also a session keyring which is never stored to
disk, but forgotten when the session ends.
