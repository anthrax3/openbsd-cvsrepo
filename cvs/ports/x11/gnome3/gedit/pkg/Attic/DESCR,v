@Shuffle things around so that the gnome3 directory is usable like
mystuff. README coming soon so anyone can start having 'fun' with gnome3
ports.
Also this will allow proper dependencies to be set from the start
instead of breaking half of the tree when GNOME3 is enabled.

@gedit is a small and lightweight UTF-8 text editor for the GNOME
environment.  gedit uses a Multiple Document Interface (MDI), which lets
you edit more than one document at the same time.

gedit supports most standard editing features, plus several not found in
your  average text editor (plugins being the most notable of these).
