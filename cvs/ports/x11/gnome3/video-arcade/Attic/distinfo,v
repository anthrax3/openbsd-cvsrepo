@Shuffle things around so that the gnome3 directory is usable like
mystuff. README coming soon so anyone can start having 'fun' with gnome3
ports.
Also this will allow proper dependencies to be set from the start
instead of breaking half of the tree when GNOME3 is enabled.

@Import gnome-video-arcade-0.8.0.

GNOME Video Arcade is a clean and simple MAME front-end for the GNOME
Desktop Environment.

GNOME Video Arcade recognizes that the frontend is not the point, the
games are. As such, its chief design goal is to help you quickly find a
game to play and then get out of the way. Its purpose is not to help you
manage your ROM collection, nor to provide a confusing graphical
interface for MAME's plethora of configuration options.
It can utilize third-party data files like arcade history and game
categories.
