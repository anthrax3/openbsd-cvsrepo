@Shuffle things around so that the gnome3 directory is usable like
mystuff. README coming soon so anyone can start having 'fun' with gnome3
ports.
Also this will allow proper dependencies to be set from the start
instead of breaking half of the tree when GNOME3 is enabled.

@import zenity 3.0.0

This is zenity - a rewrite of gdialog, the GNOME port of dialog which
allows you to display dialog boxes from the commandline and shell
scripts. If you understand, things are just as they are. If you don't
understand, things are just as they are.
