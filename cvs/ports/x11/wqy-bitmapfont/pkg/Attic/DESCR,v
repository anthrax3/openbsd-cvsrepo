@The Wen Quan Yi bitmap font is a manually fine-tuned multi-strike bitmap
font for on-screen display of Chinese (traditional and simplified).
It has arguably the most complete coverage for Chinese characters among
all known open-source fonts, including CJK Unified Ideograph (U4E00 - U9FA5)
and CJK Unified Ideograph Extension A (U3400 - U4DB5) glyphs at four 
different sizes (9pt-12X12 pixel, 10pt-13X13 pixel, 11pt-15X15 pixel,
12pt-16x16 pixel) and two weights (medium and bold).
