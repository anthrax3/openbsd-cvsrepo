@Fvwm95 is a hack based on fvwm2.x.  It tries to emulate the good
features of a well known product without bloating the regular fvwm code.

The main aspects are:

* A familiar look and feel.  It can be interesting for users moving from
  the MS-World to Unix, or for those who have to switch regularly
  between the two.  Or for those that simply would like to have the same
  MS look and feel in Unix, or for those that just want to have another
  window manager, or...  But before all, it's meant to be useful, simple
  and efficient.

* Same flexible and easy configuration as the native fvwm.

* Functionality extensible via loadable modules.

* A taskbar: find quickly an application window and don't take space
  with icon windows.
