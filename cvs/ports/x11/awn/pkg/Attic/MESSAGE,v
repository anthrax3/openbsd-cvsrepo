@In order for "avant-window-navigator" to run, you will need to have a
compositing manager running. Examples of these are:

  - xcompmgr
  - metacity (x11/gnome/metacity)
  - xfwm4 (x11/xfce4/xfwm4)

avant-window-navigator has to be setup, you can do this by running
"awn-settings" or by selecting "Awn Settings" from the menu.
