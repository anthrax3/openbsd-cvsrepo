@   KDE is a network transparent contemporary desktop environment for UNIX
   workstations. It was written by a world-wide network of software
   engineers committed to free software development. KDE seeks to fill
   the need for an easy to use desktop for Unix workstations, similar to
   the desktop environments found under the MacOS or Window95/NT. We
   believe that the UNIX operating system is the best operating system
   available today. In fact UNIX has been the undisputed choice of the
   information technology professional for many years. When it comes to
   stability, scalability and openness there is no competition to UNIX .
   However, the lack of an easy to use contemporary desktop environment
   for UNIX has prevented UNIX from finding its way onto the desktops of
   the typical computer user in offices and homes. UNIX dominates the
   server market and is the preferred computing platform for computing
   professional and scientists. Without UNIX the internet would not be.
   But UNIX did not address the needs of the average computer user. This
   fact is particularly unfortunate since a number of implementations of
   UNIX ( Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD etc) are freely availabe on the
   internet. All of which are of exceptional quality and stability.
