@Skippy is best described as a full-screen task-switcher for X11.  It
tries to provide an alternative when taskbars or regular task-switchers
aren't the most efficient way of switching tasks (like when you have a
lot of applications open). When activated (currently only through a
hotkey), it will arrange and scale snapshots of all windows on the
current desktop and it'll let you pick a window using a mouse or a
keyboard.
