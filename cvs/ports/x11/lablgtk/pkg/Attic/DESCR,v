@LablGTK is an Objective Caml interface to gtk+.

It uses the rich type system of Objective Caml 3 to provide a strongly
typed, yet very comfortable, object-oriented interface to gtk+. This
is not that easy if you know the dynamic typing approach taken by
gtk+.

It is still under development, but already fully functional. All
widgets (but one) are available, with almost all their methods. Many
examples are provided.

Objective Caml threads are supported, including for the toplevel,
which allows for interactive use of the library.
