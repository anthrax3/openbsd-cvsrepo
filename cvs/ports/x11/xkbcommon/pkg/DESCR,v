@xkbcommon is a library to handle keyboard descriptions, including
loading them from disk, parsing them and handling their state. It's
mainly meant for client toolkits, window systems, and other system
applications; currently that includes Wayland, kmscon, GTK+, Qt,
Clutter, and more. It is also used by some XCB applications for proper
keyboard support.

xkbcommon is a library to handle keyboard descriptions,
loading them from disk, parsing them and handling their state.     

Our pre-historic bison has been mummified and put into a museum.
So include a parser.c generated with a fresh young bison that still roams the plains.
