@re-add krusader 2.6.0

Krusader is an advanced twin panel (commander style) file manager for KDE and
other desktops in the *nix world, similar to Midnight or Total Commander. It
provides all the file management features you could possibly want. Plus:

- Extensive archive handling
- Mounted filesystem support
- File transfers with (S)FTP
- Advanced search module
- An internal viewer and editor
- Directory synchronisation
- File content comparisons
- Powerful batch renaming
- And much much more ...

It supports a wide variety of archive formats and can handle other KIO slaves
such as smb or fish. It is (almost) completely customizable, very user friendly
and fast.

cvs re-adding help from schwarze@@. Thanks!
