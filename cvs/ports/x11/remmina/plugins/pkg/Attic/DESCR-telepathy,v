@import remmina (core + plugins)

Remmina is a remote desktop client written in GTK+, aiming to be useful for
system administrators and travellers, who need to work with lots of remote
computers in front of either large monitors or tiny netbooks. Remmina supports
multiple network protocols in an integrated and consistant user interface.
Various protocols are supported whose functionality can be added by adding the
corresponding remmina-plugins package.

Right now VNC, RDP, XDMCP and Telepathy are supported.
