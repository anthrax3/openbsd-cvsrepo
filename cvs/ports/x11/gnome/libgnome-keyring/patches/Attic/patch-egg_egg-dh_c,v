log
@Bring over a new version of the secure memory code from gcr and merge
updated secure memory code from libsecret (upstream).

Huge thanks to Stefan Walter from GNOME for doing this; it finally fixes
applications crash when interacting with the keyring.

Core of the issue is in libtool and is currently being worked on.
