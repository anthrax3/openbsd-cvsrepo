@The GNOME Shell redefines user interactions with the GNOME desktop. In
particular, it offers new paradigms for launching applications,
accessing documents, and organizing open windows in GNOME. Later, it
will introduce a new applets eco-system and offer new solutions for
other desktop features, such as notifications and contacts management.
The GNOME Shell is intended to replace functions handled by the GNOME
Panel and by the window manager in previous versions of GNOME. The GNOME
Shell has rich visual effects enabled by new graphical technologies.
