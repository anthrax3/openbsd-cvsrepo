1.3
log
@Major update to gnome-session-2.28.0... with some part of 2.26.2 because we
do not support the *-kit thingies.
There is a small regression wrt to shutdown/reboot which I'll work on in
the next days.
Also, this port is not a meta-port anymore, if you want a basic functionnal
GNOME desktop, make sure you read the README.OpenBSD file (as agreed with
my other half jasper@@).

so many cute animals got injured while working on this update, I lost count...
(sorry kiki...)

gnome.desktop is already installed by GDM. and since
gnome-session has a run-time dependency on GDM, there's
no point in installing it twice.
