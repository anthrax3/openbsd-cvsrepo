@gvfs is a userspace virtual filesystem designed to work with the i/o
abstractions of gio. It installs several modules that are automatically
used by applications using the APIs of libgio.

gvfs comes with a set of backends, including trash support, sftp, smb,
http, dav and others.

There is a set of command line programs starting with "gvfs-" that
lets you run commands (like cat, ls, stat, etc) on files in the gvfs
mounts.

@- minor update to version 1.0.3
fixes some mem leak and bugs
- also subpackage this port the same way gnome-vfs2 is (i.e. samba is no
longer a requirement for the main package)
- explicitely depends on latest glib2 (requested by jasper@@)

GVFS is a replacement for GnomeVFS, the GNOME Virtual File System.

GVFS consists of two parts: a shared library which is loaded by
applications supporting GIO and GVFS itself, a collection of daemons
which communicate with each other and the GIO module over D-Bus. This
moves the virtual file systems out of client processes, contrary to
GnomeVFS, but somewhat similar to KIO.
