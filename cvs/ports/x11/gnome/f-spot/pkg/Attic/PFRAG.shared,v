@Add more libtool love. Set SHARED_ONLY.

f-spot now starts and works fine (very small testing).
However, some icons do not show up correctly yet and it cores dump on exit
so I'm leaving it broken for now.

@Update to f-spot-0.6.0.0.

@import f-spot 0.5.0.2

The main F-Spot user interface in Browse mode is shown. F-Spot supports
16 common files types, including JPEG, GIF, TIFF, RAW, and others.
Import your photos from your hard drive, camera (including PTP type), or
iPod.
Photos can be tagged for searching and grouping, and the timeline gives
quick sense of temporal location, and quanity of photos taken. F-Spot
can view and export EXIF and XMP metadata in your images.
Other features include fullscreen and slideshow modes.

it needs some more tweaking, hence it's not hooked to the builds yet.
