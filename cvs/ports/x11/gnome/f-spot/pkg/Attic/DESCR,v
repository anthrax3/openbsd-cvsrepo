@F-Spot is a Mono-based Personal Photo Management package. F-Spot
supports 16 common files types, including JPEG, GIF, TIFF, RAW, and
others.

Import your photos from your hard drive, camera (including PTP
type), or iPod.

Photos can be tagged for searching and grouping, and the timeline gives
a quick sense of temporal location, and quantity of photos taken. F-Spot
can view and export EXIF and XMP metadata in your images.

Other features include fullscreen and slideshow modes.
