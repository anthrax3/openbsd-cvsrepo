@- when db4 is installed it will be picked whatever option we set, so
merge -db4 subpackage into -main (which makes sense anyway)
- fix WANTLIB and regen PLIST for all subpackages

ok jasper@@

GNOME Data Access (GDA) is an attempt to provide uniform access to
different kinds of data sources (databases, information servers, mail
spools, etc).  It is a complete architecture that provides all you need
to access your data.  It is defined by a set of CORBA interfaces as
generic as possible (but very powerful at the same time) so that any
kind of data source can be accessed through them.

most work done by ajacoutot@@, based on an initial port by me.
