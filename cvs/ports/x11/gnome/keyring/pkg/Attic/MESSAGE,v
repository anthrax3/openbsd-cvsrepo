@The gnome-keyring SSH agent is now usable, so enable it.
@
text
@The gnome-keyring SSH agent is disabled by default. If needed, there are
two ways to enable it.

System-wide:
  sudo gconftool-2 --direct --config-source=`gconftool-2 --get-default-source` \
  	--type bool --set /apps/gnome-keyring/daemon-components/ssh true

Per user:
  gconftool-2 --set --type bool /apps/gnome-keyring/daemon-components/ssh true

log
@- disable gnome-keyring SSH agent by default; as this is a GConf entry,
it can be enabled easily for who needs it.
We do this because even when one does not have any key under ~/.ssh/ the
agent fires up asking for a password which is quite annoying!
