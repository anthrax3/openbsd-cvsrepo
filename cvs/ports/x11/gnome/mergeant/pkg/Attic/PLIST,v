@- remove libgnomedb and mergeant. both have and will never be ported to the
libgda 4.0 api. instead the libgda devs will release a new tool, that supersedes
mergeant. (which will be imported when it's available)

log
@import mergeant 0.67

The GNOME-DB project aims to provide a free unified data access
architecture to the GNOME project. GNOME-DB is useful for any
application that accesses persistent data (not only databases, but
data), since it now contains a pretty good data management API.

Mergeant is a front-end for database administrators and database
application developers.
It can use all the data providers that are configured for libgda
(mysql, postgredql, sqlite, bdb, openldap, etc).
