@Remove bug-buddy.
It's useless and actually triggers issues instead of helping to
report them.

@bug-buddy is a graphical bug reporting tool.  It can extract debugging
information from a crashed application and create either a stacktrace or
a minidump file to send to the GNOME bug tracker.

bug-buddy uses gdb to collect the stacktrace from the crashed
application, and google-breakpad to create a minidump if the stacktrace
doesn't contain enough debugging information.  Stacktraces are then sent
to the GNOME Bugzilla, while minidumps go to the GNOME Socorro server,
where they get filed with the missing debug information and, if needed,
eventually forwarded to Bugzilla.

A GTK+ module, called gnomebreakpad, allows bug-buddy to come up
automatically every time a GTK+ application crashes.
