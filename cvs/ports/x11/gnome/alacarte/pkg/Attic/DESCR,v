@Resurrect alacarte now that's it's being maintained again and update to
alacarte-3.6.1.

1.2
log
@remove, this app is broken and deprecated in several ways:
- still hasn't been ported to the new libgnome-menus api
- hasn't had a real release in two years
- uses old pygobject2 with pygi support, which has been moved to
  py-gobject3 to facilitate other development in the tree.

  (at least gmenu-simple-editor works again..)

Alacarte is an easy-to-use menu editor for GNOME that can add and edit
new entries and menus. It works with the freedesktop.org menu
specification and should work with any desktop environment that uses the
spec.
