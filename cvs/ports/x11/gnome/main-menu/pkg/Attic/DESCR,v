Better start on a cleaner base.

@The gnome-main-menu is a set of three utilities.  A gnome-panel applet
similar to the traditional main-menu but a few addtions and changes.
In particular the gnome-main-menu does not provide direct access to all
the applications on the system, but rather displays user specified
"favorites" and recently launched applications.

Access to all the applications is made through the second of the three
utilities, the application-browser, which is a larger format application
than that the traditional main-menu which is managed by the window
manager to allow for resizing, etc.

The final utility is the gnome-control-center which is laid out exactly
as the application-browser, but providing access to all the system's
configuration utilities.

Both the application-browser and the gnome-control-center are accessible
directly from the main-menu.

@Import gnome-main-menu-0.9.15.

This is the default GNOME menu that SUSE Linux uses.
