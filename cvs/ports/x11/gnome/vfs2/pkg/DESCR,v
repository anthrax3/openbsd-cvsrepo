@We are about to deprecate gnomevfs within the tree as it has been
superseded by gio/gvfs long time ago and isn't maintained anymore.
First move is to remove the -smb subpackage which is of no use.

@GnomeVFS is a filesystem abstraction library allowing applications
plugable transparent access to a variety of "real" filesystems, from
WebDAV to digital cameras, to the local filesystem. It also contains a
number of other convenient file utilities such as a comprehensive MIME
database / Application registry, and a copy engine.

Note that the GnomeVFS has been deprecated in favor of gio/gvfs.
