@import tracker 0.6.93

Tracker is a powerful desktop-neutral first class object database,
tag/metadata database, search tool and indexer.

Tracker is also extremely fast and super efficient with your systems
memory when compared with some other competing frameworks and is by far
the fastest and most memory efficient Nautilus search and Deskbar
backends currently availble.

It consists of a common object database that allows entities to have an
almost infinte number of properties, metadata (both embedded/harvested
as well as user definable), a comprehensive database of keywords/tags
and links to other entities.

NB: most patches have already been committed upstream by now.
