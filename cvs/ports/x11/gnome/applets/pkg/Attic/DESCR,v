1.3
log
@Remove Gnome 1 core and applets.

Gnome 1, as a standalone environment, has left the building.  Applications
that use the remaining Gnome 1 ports (bonobo, bonobo-conf, controlcenter,
libs, oaf, print and vfs) will still work, but the Gnome 1 desktop itself
is no more.

This is a first step at Gnome 1 removal.  Other Gnome 1 bits will be
removed as their dependent ports get updated.

This also removes the Gnome 1 vs Gnome 2 conflicts so it should make the
package builders happy.
