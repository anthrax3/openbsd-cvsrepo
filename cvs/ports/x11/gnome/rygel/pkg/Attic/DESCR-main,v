@Actually merge the tracker plugin; it doesn't bring any dependency on
meta-tracker since it uses DBus to activate tracker-store and if it's
not there, then it will automatically disable the plugin.
It's way simpler this way, my fault...

@Rygel is a home media solution that allows you to easily share audio,
video and pictures, and control of media player on your home network. In
technical terms it is both a UPnP AV MediaServer and MediaRenderer
implemented through a plug-in mechanism. Interoperability with other
devices in the market is achieved by conformance to very strict
requirements of DLNA and on the fly conversion of media to format that
client devices are capable of handling.
