@Update to gnome-libs 1.4.1.4

* man pages, fix compilation with db1 (to some degree at least), fix
crashes in gtk-xmhtml (for help browser), mem leaks plugged in
gnome-mime, compiler/warning fixes, better multibyte handling in zvt,
report mousewheel events correctly to apps in zvt, fix crashes in
gnome-mdi, work with KDE session management, plus more.

Ok naddy@@, with additional testing by fries@@.

log
@* Use variables instead of hardcoded prefixes.
* Take care to set a sane PATH.
* Add set -e
* Copy example files into ${PREFIX}/share/examples/PORTNAME.
* Replace PKGNAME with P_NAME in INSTALL/DEINSTALL scripts, unclear
  since it already exists in the Makefile with a different value.
* Change output of INSTALL/DEINSTALL to be more like other scripts
  found in the tree(suggested by heko@@).
