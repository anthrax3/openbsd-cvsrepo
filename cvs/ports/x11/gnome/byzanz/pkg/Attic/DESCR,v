@Byzanz is a simple tool to record a running X desktop to an animation suitable
for presentation in a web browser. It's design has been guided by the
following principles:
- purpose
  Byzanz records animations for presentation in a web browser. If something
  doesn't fit this goal, it should not be part of Byzanz.
- correctness
  When Byzanz provides a feature, it does this correctly. In particular, it
  does not crash or corrupt data.
- simplicity
  The user interface and programming code are simple and easy to understand
  and don't contain any unecessary features.
  Byzanz does not attempt to do be smarter than you are.
