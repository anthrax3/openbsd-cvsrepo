@Remove nemiver. It's been marked BROKEN since it was first imported.
There is a nasty dead-lock happening somewhere but noone was ever able to
find out why.
It someone wants to work on it, it's in the attic...

@Import nemiver-0.9.4.

Nemiver is a standalone graphical debugger that integrates well in the
GNOME desktop environment. It currently features a backend which uses
the well known GNU Debugger gdb to debug C / C++ programs.

Note that it is *not* yet working properly so it's not hooked up.
