@GGv is the Gnome Postscript and PDF viewer program.  The name comes from
GhostView, a non-gnome GNU postscript viewer application on which GGv is
based.

GGv is a frontend for GhostScript, an interpreter of PostScript that is
able to properly render PostScript documents in a display or a printer.
GGv serves as a layer that isolates the user from the cumbersome options
and interface of GhostScript, and, at the same time, gives extra
features such as panning and persistent user settings.

The main features that make me personally like ggv are its antialiasing
(use the preferences dialog to turn it on and reload the document --
your eyes will pop out of their sockets so be careful) and nice user
interface, allowing e.g.  dragging of postscript files into GGv, moving
the postscript display by dragging the mouse in the pager window or the
main window.  GGv can display more than one document at the same time.
Also, the transparent support for compressed postscript and pdf are
handy.

This is the version of GGv for GNOME 2.
