@Update to control-center (1.4.0.1 -> 1.4.0.4)

* sort themes case-insensitively, select newly installed theme by
default, portability/compile/warning fixes, let sound-capplet restore
gmix mixer levels at startup, fix crash in theme-switcher on Solaris,
crash in theme-switcher on all platforms, don't truncate Debian name
in the splash screen.

Ok naddy@@, with additional testing by fries@@.

1.2
log
@* Use variables instead of hardcoded prefixes.
* Take care to set a sane PATH.
* Add set -e
* Copy example files into ${PREFIX}/share/examples/PORTNAME.
* Replace PKGNAME with P_NAME in INSTALL/DEINSTALL scripts, unclear
  since it already exists in the Makefile with a different value.
* Change output of INSTALL/DEINSTALL to be more like other scripts
  found in the tree (suggested by heko@@).
* Move scrollkeeper-update stuff to PLIST
* Remove non-owned entries from PLIST
