   http://mycroft.mozdev.org/ has got plenty of plugins. Beware that a lot are
   out of date and will require some changes. Use pinot-search on the
   command-line to run a quick check on a plugin, eg
-  $ pinot-search sherlock /usr/share/pinot/engines/Bozo.src "clowns"
+  $ pinot-search sherlock ${PREFIX}/share/pinot/engines/Bozo.src "clowns"
 
   Plugins are categorized by channels. For Sherlock plugins, the routeType
   element under SEARCH specifies the name of the channel the plugin belongs to.

   Pinot can index any directory configured under the Indexing tab of the
   Preferences box. Monitoring is optional and should be disabled for the
-  directories whose contents seldom change, eg /usr/share/doc.
+  directories whose contents seldom change, eg ${PREFIX}/share/doc.
   Indexing and monitoring of directories is handled by the D-Bus service.
 
   In 0.90 and newer, the daemon will skip symlinks that refer to locations

   Pinot v0.90 and newer provide a "tagged cd" script that enables to change
   a shell's current directory to the directory that matches the path elements
   passed as parameter. For instance, after setting :
-  $ alias pcd='. /usr/share/pinot/pinot-cd.sh'
+  $ alias pcd='. ${PREFIX}/share/pinot/pinot-cd.sh'
   if ~/Documents is configured for indexing in Preferences, the following
   command would change the current directory to ~/Documents/Web/Stats :
   $ pcd Documents Stats

@Import pinot-0.94 (hiiips!)

Pinot is a D-Bus service that crawls, indexes your documents and
monitors them for changes, with a GTK-based user interface that enables
to query the index built by the service or your favourite Web engine,
and display and analyze the results.

If you have the deskbar-applet package installed, you will be able to
use the pinot-live.py or pinot-module.py plugins from the applet.


Thanks to pinot developer Fabrice Colin for making me porting it and for
his hints.
