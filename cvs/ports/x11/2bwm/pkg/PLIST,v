From maintainer Kaashif Hymabaccus, ok juanfra@@ bcallah@@

pkg/DESCR:
Fast floating WM, with the particularity that windows have 2 borders,
written over the XCB library and derived from mcwm written by Michael
Cardell.  In 2bwm everything is accessible from the keyboard but a
pointing device can be used for move, resize and raise/lower.
