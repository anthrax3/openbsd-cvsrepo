@Initial import of the MATE Desktop Environment (version 1.18)...

The MATE Desktop Environment is the continuation of GNOME 2.
It provides an intuitive and attractive desktop environment, using
traditional metaphors for Linux and other Unix-like operating systems.

This is imported as WIP (almost done though) to ease review.
