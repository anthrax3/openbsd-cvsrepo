@WindowLab is a small and simple window manager of novel design.

It has a click-to-focus but not raise-on-focus policy, a window resizing
mechanism that allows one or many edges of a window to be changed in one
action, and an innovative menubar that shares the same part of the
screen as the taskbar. Window titlebars are prevented from going off the
edge of the screen by constraining the mouse pointer, and when
appropriate the pointer is also constrained to the taskbar/menubar in
order to make target menu items easier to hit.
