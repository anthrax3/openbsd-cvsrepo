Fix misuse of CMake

While here, install *.cfg files in a location where SampleBrowser
can find them by default and remove obsolete pthread-related
patches...

@OGRE (Object-Oriented Graphics Rendering Engine) is a scene-oriented,
flexible 3D engine written in C++ designed to make it easier and
more intuitive for developers to produce applications utilising
hardware-accelerated 3D graphics. The class library abstracts all
the details of using the underlying system libraries like Direct3D
and OpenGL and provides an interface based on world objects and
other intuitive classes.

lots of feedback & macppc testing mpi@@, also tested by kirby@@ and Antti Harri.
