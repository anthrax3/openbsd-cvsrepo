@gkrellshoot is a gkrellm plugin that gives easy access to Screen
Lock and Screen Shoot facility.

For Screen capture this uses ImageMagick.  Displays animations
(Screen Saver like) along with 'Lock' and 'Shoot' button to be
clicked on.

With Screen Shoot one can either grab a window, selected area or
whole screen, also one can delay the Screen Shoot by given number
of seconds.

One other feature is that grabbed image can be viewed by given image
viewer. Pressing 'Lock' button will lock the screen and starts your
screen saver.
