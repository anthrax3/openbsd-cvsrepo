@bye bye i3bar and p5-AnyEvent-I3

@i3bar is a xcb and libev based status and workspace bar for the
i3 window manager. It is best thought of as a replacement for the
i3-wsbar + dzen2 combination. It creates a workspace bar for every
active screen and displays a piped-in statusline rightaligned on
every bar.
It does not sample any status information itself, so you still need
a program like conky for that.
