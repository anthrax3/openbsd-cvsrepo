| Running ${FULLPKGNAME} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

To prevent errors, the "unclutter" program (from x11/unclutter) must not
be running when using gnome-mplayer.

MPlayer software volume control (softvol) is enabled by default because
there is no volume control in mplayer's sndio(7) backend.

@Add a consistent header that substitutes FULLPKGNAME for the READMEs.

To use the gnome-power-manager's inhibit method instead of the
XScrnSaver one, go into Edit->Preferences->Interface and remove the
checkmark from "Use X Screen Saver control over Gnome Power Manager"
(this obviously needs the gnome-power-manager package to be installed).
@


1.1
log
@Enable support for gnome-power-manager's inhibit method now that
we have a port of gnome-power-manager.
Add a note into pkg/README.
