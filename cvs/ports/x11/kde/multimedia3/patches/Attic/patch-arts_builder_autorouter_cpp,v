Using signed char as an index is a bad idea.

1.1
log
@Add a couple of fixes for KDE3 multimedia package:

  * avoid crash in xine backend for aRts (tedu's way)
  * make the build more reliable/repeatable
  * fix some integer types handling (signed as index, long for 64-bit)

Most of those fixes were forgotten many months ago; the crash was notified
by Alexandre H on ports@@ and further investigated by nigel@@, thanks!
