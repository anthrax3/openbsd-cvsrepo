@Application for building and simulating digital circuits easily.

Provides an easy way for building circuits containing standard
components like AND, OR, XOR and flipflops like RS and JK.  More complex 
and reuseable circuits can be built from sub-circuits.

By default, the simulation is running permanently while building circuits.  
Also available is a single stepping simulation to recognize peaks.
