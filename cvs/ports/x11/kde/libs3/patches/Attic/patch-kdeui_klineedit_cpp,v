@basic import of kde 3.1.95, still missing a few parts.

TODO:
- compile the missing packages.
- redo konsole fixes for our ttys.
- figure out why kuickshow is broken.
- make sure we get all dependencies.
- repair kscd.
- find out why nsplugins does not like the native jdk.
- figure out how to get kvim to work.
- change filenames or adjust check-lib-depends to cope.
