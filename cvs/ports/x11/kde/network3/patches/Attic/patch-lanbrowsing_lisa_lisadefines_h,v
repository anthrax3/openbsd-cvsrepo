@Fix 3 vulnerabilites.

The resLISa daemon contains a buffer overflow vulnerability which
potentially enables any local user to obtain access to a raw socket
if 'reslisa' is installed SUID root.  This vulnerability was
discovered by the iDEFENSE security team and Texonet.

The lisa daemon contains a buffer overflow vulnerability which
potentially enables any local user, as well any any remote attacker
on the LAN who is able to gain control of the LISa port (7741 by
default), to obtain root privileges.

In addition, a remote attacker potentially may be able to gain
access to a victim's account by using an "lan://" URL in an HTML
page or via another KDE application.  These vulnerabilities were
discovered by Olaf Kirch at SuSE Linux AG.
