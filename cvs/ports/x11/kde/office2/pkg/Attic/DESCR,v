@Koffice is a collection of office applications linked together by a
common basis. This common basis assures that all office application
can work together. You can, for instance, insert a spreadsheet in
your thesis without leaving your document. Editing the spreadsheet
happens _inside_ your thesis.
 
The applications included in KOffice as of the release of KDE2 are:
- KWord
  Professional text editing
- KSpread
  Professional number cruncher/spreadsheet
- KPresenter
  Professional presentation program
- KChart
  Graphing of your abstract data
- Kontour
  Vector graphics tool
- KOffice Workspace
  A combination of all of the above

@Initial port of koffice2, done 3 times over.

`Proof of concept', port doesn't really work yet.
- kpresenter crashes,
- all parts only run under koshell control,
- closing any document will crash koffice.

Apart from that, this looks usable.
