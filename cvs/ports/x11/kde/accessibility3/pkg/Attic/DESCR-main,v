@Merge KDE3 icons from "mono" icon theme into x11/kde4/artwork,-mono.

This way we now have only one mono-icon-theme package, and bulk builds
should become happy. We probably got lucky before due to
x11/kde/accessibility3 being always built before x11/kde4/artwork.

@KDE Accessibility aids:
* kmag, screen magnifier
* kmousetool, using mouse under difficult conditions
* kmouth, voice synthesizer

The "mono" icon theme from original kdeaccessbility package lives
in a separate package called mono-icon-theme.
