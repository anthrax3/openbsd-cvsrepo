@KBlackBox is a superb graphical logical game, inspired by emacs'
blackbox. Copying policy is GPL. Major part of this help file is based
on the original emacs's help.

KBlackBox is a game of hide and seek played on an grid of boxes. Your
opponent (Random number generator, in this case) has hidden several
balls within this box. By shooting rays into the box and observing where
they emerge it is possible to deduce the positions of the hidden balls.
The fewer rays you use to find the balls, the lower your score.
