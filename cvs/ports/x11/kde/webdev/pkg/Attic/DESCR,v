@Remove another bunch of KDE3 ports: outdated, superseded and useless ones.

@Quanta+ is more than a HTML editor, although currently the majority of the users
are using Quanta+ to create web pages (HTML and PHP). Quanta+ supports a
lot of markup and script languages, and the number of supported languages
can be easily extended, even by the user.

Currently this program can be very useful for quick web development,
however it is still in the early stages of the overall objectives.
The objective is to product a complete web development environment!
