@This game was originally invented in Japan in the early 80's and won a computer
game contest there. "Sokoban" is japanese for "warehouse keeper". The idea is 
that you are a warehouse keeper trying to push crates to their proper locations
in a warehouse. 

The problem is that you cannot pull the crates or step over them. If you are not
careful, some of the crates can get stuck in wrong places and/or block your way. 
It can be rather difficult just to solve a level. But if you want to make it 
even harder, you can try to minimise the number of moves and/or pushes you use 
to solve the level. 

To make the game more fun for small kids (below 10 years or so), some 
collections with easier levels are also included in ksokoban. These are marked 
(easy) in the level colletion menu. Of course, these levels can be fun for 
adults too, for example if you don't want to expose yourself to too much mental
strain.
