@This program is a clone of the well known Mahjongg game. 

Your mission in this game is to remove all tiles from the game board. A matching
pair of tiles can be removed, if they are 'free', which means that no other 
tiles block them on the left or right side. 

This game requires a 256 (or more) color display and a minimum resolution of 
640 x 480.
