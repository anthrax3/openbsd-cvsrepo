@This is Narusegawa from Love Hina (an anime series). I haven't
drawn it: I took the images from a windows sitter found in 
http://www.lovehina.zonaxtrema.net/.  Apparently they don't have
copyright (I even tried running strings on the windows binary, but as
it comes from Japan, it wouldn't work anyway) because if you right click
on it (the windows sitter, of course!) it says "(C)_________________"
as if the author haven't put it. Whatever.

Have fun!
