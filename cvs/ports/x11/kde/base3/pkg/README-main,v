+-----------------------------------------------------------------------
| Running KDE3 desktop on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

If you don't run KDM, you can start KDE from your .xinitrc with
this kind of sequence:

  kdmdesktop      # to get a nice display
  KDEDIR=${PREFIX} exec ssh-agent ${PREFIX}/bin/startkde

You don't have to run the KDE desktop to just use KDE applications like
Konqueror.

As a user, you may have to run kappfinder from time to time to make
sure you have up-to-date menus.

Install kdesamba if you need to access Samba (Windows) shares.
