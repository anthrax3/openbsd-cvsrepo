@KDE is a network transparent contemporary desktop environment for UNIX
workstations. It was written by a world-wide network of software
engineers committed to free software development. KDE seeks to fill
the need for an easy to use desktop for Unix workstations, similar to
the desktop environments found under the MacOS or Window95/NT.

This package holds the samba glue for KDE.
