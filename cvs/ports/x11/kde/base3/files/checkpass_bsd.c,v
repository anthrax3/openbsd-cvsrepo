1.2
log
@Pass NULL instead of forcing "passwd" in auth_userokay(3). The latter
won't run interactive auth styles anyway, and focing "passwd" breaks for
users willing to use other styles without fallback to "passwd".

Same as the patch already went in for KDE4 sent by Daniele Mazzocchio.

1.1
log
@Move KDE3's KDM and kcheckpass to BSD authentication.

This effectively unbreaks KDE3 after recent changes in getpw* land,
same way as it was done for KDE4.
