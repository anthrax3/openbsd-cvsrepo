@Remove COMMENTS.
Update dependencies for uic, and pcre (needed for javascript among other
things).

Update PLIST.

Thanks to all the guys who told me about uic. I just wanted to make sure my
changes were compiling before committing.

Note that brain-dead libs2 will complain that it can't find uic, as all
the kde ports configure are cloned from each other, but in fact it doesn't
require uic, which is very fortunate.
