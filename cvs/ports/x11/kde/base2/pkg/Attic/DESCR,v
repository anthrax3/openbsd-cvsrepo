@KDE is a network transparent contemporary desktop environment for UNIX
workstations. It was written by a world-wide network of software
engineers committed to free software development. KDE seeks to fill
the need for an easy to use desktop for Unix workstations, similar to
the desktop environments found under the MacOS or Window95/NT. 

This package holds the basic kde applications: the desktop, kate, konsole,
konqueror, the theme manager, the file manager, the print manager,
kdm, screensavers, kaddressbook, etc.


Setup tips:
- if you don't run kdm, you can start kde from your .xinitrc with this 
kind of sequence:

kdmdesktop	# to get a nice display
KDEDIR=/usr/local exec ssh-agent /usr/local/bin/startkde

- you don't have to run all of kde to use some applications like konqueror.

- as a user, you should run kappfinder from time to time to make sure you
have up-to-date menus.

- when upgrading from an old version of kde, it's usually best to start
over on your .kde files.  Managing legacy config files is quite buggy yet.

KDE2 is an almost complete rewrite of kde1. This port is not yet complete,
nor perfectly usable, as kde2 is reaching completion.
