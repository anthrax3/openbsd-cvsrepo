@ParaGUI is a cross-platform high-level application framework and GUI
(graphical user interface) library. It can be compiled on various
platforms.

ParaGUI's cross-platform nature is completely based on the Simple
DirectMedia Layer (SDL).

Highlights of the library:

 - published under LGPL 
 - straight forward C++ class-design (see the API documentation) 
 - XML configuration of the new style engine 
 - asynchronous messagehandling (messageposts between objects) 
 - multithreaded 
 - highly customizable widgets (background gradients, background images,
   transparency, colors, fonts) 
 - many standard widgets already implemented (buttons, labels, scrollbars,
   progressbars, windows ...) 
 - create your own widgets (subclass an existing widget)
