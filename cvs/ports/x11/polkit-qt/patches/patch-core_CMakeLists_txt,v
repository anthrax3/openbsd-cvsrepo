1.1.1.1
log
@Re-import Polkit-Qt. It supports both Qt4 and Qt5 versions now, which
could be built and installed simultaneously from the same sources.
The PKGSTEM+CMAKESTEM variables in SUBST_VARS look like somewhat ugly,
but this way update-plist does its job correctly for default FLAVOR
at least.

One more patch added speficially for Qt5 case, forcing linking to
libestdc++.

While here, added NO_TEST and fixed COMMENT.

Much input & okay aja@@ (MAINTAINER).

Next steps are: switching bulk builds from x11/polkit-qt4 to x11/polkit-qt,
and then removing the former.
