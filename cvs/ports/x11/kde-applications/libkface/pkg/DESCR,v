1.1.1.1
log
@Import first bits of KDE Applications software collection.

This includes two ex-Digikam projects:

  - libkface, face detection library;
  - libkgeomap, photo-to-geo linking library.

There are two more projects moving out from Digikam:

  - libkvkontakte, client implementation of VK.com API, lives in extragear,
    to be reviewed and imported separately;
  - libmediawiki, has no release tags and thus is kept as a digikam-kde4
    subpackage.

Improted projects will be kept unlinked until Digikam update.
