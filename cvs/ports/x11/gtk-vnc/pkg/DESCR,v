@gtk-vnc is a project providing client side APIs for the RFB protocol /
VNC remote desktop technology.

It is built using coroutines allowing it to be completely asynchronous
while remaining single threaded. It provides two core C libraries,
libgvnc for interacting with the core RFB protocol and libgtk-vnc for a
GTK display widget.

gtk-vnc provides a core library written in C, using coroutines to allow
it to be completely asynchronous while remaining single threaded. A
wrapper library using PyGTK provides access to the widget functionality
from Python. Two example programs illustrate use of the widget by
re-implementing the traditional 'vncviewer' in a few 10's of lines of
code.
