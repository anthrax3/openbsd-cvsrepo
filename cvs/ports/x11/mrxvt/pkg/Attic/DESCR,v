@Remove x11/mrxvt.

Mrxvt is based on rxvt which we recently removed due to the fact that
upstream is dead and that the code is vulnerable to CVE-2017-7483.

Mrxvt is vulnerable as well, and latest release is from 2008.

@Mrxvt (previously named materm) is a lightweight, powerful multi-tabbed
terminal emulator for the X window system.
Mrxvt is based on rxvt version 2.7.11 CVS and aterm.
It implements many useful features seen in some modern X terminal
emulators (like gnome-terminal and konsole) but aims to be fast,
lightweight and independent of standard toolkits or desktop environments
(e.g. GNOME / KDE).
