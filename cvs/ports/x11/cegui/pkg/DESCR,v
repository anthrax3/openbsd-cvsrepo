@Crazy Eddie's GUI System is a free library providing windowing and
widgets for graphics APIs / engines where such functionality is not
natively available, or severely lacking. The library is object
orientated, written in C++, and targeted at games developers who
should be spending their time creating great games, not building
GUI sub-systems!
