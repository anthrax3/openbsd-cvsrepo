@Qt is a toolkit for building a GUI for X in C++.
There are some user documentation files in {QT_DOC}, but
the main documentation is in the qt-html package,
or on the web (${HOMEPAGE}).

There is also a qt-examples package, that contains a tutorial and
simple example programs (source + binaries).

@If HOMEPAGE is defined in Makefile, reference it in DESCR, too.

Fix a few minor cosmetic issues along the way.

@- don't try to be smart with examples and tutorial, moving those files
  around doesn't work, as there are cross-dependencies.
- move LOCALBASE/X11BASE setting to post-patch, as this allows having
  complete, independent Makefiles for examples/tutorial.
- use better filenames for patches and include patches to setup the debug
  Qt config files.

@- use sub-packages to split examples/tutorial bins/source into an
  examples subpackage and the html documentation (which is now being
  installed) into an html subpackage
- cleanup install target a bit
- make use of a few variables to specify paths for installation, QT_INCDIR,
  QT_LIBDIR, QT_MANDIR, QT_EXAMPLES, QT_TUTORIAL and QT_DOC
- man pages have moved from PREFIX/man to PREFIX/lib/qt/man to stay
  consistant with the qt2 port
