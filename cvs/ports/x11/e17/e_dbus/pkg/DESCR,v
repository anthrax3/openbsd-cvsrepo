log
@- update the existing enlightenment EFL libraries to 1.7.5 and
  remove REVISIONs
- bump SO_VERSION of e_dbus to 4.0, because of API changes
- modify license marker for edje, where the epp binary is GPLv2
- add EFL libraries elementary, emotion and ethumb leaving out eeze
  which is based on udev which does not exist in OpenBSD to have a
  complete base for other e17 apps/libs, e.g. terminology
- bump REVISION for x11/e17/e because of new dependencies and remove
  EXTRACT_SUFX, because the distfile is available as tar.gz
- correct LIB_DEPENDS (pkgpaths instead of bogus libversions),
  adjust/simplify LIB_DEPENDS according to the EFL structure and
  regen WANTLIBs accordingly

@This is the start of some basic convenience wrappers around dbus
to ease integrating dbus with EFL based applications.
When using e_dbus, direct use of the low level dbus api is still
heavily required for processing messages.

This is the start of some basic convenience wrappers around dbus 
to ease integrating dbus with EFL based applications.
When using e_dbus, direct use of the low level dbus api is still 
heavily required for processing messages.

with feedback and tweaks by me.
