@Fix typo in pkg/DESCR.

@EET is a tiny library designed to write an arbitary set of chunks of
data to a file and optionally compress each chunk (very much like a zip
file) and allow fast random-access reading of the file later on.  It
does not do zip as a zip itself has more complexity than is needed, and
it was much simpler to implement this once here.
