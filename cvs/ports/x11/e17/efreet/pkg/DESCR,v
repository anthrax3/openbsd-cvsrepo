@- it's GNOME, not Gnome2 or gnome or any other variation

discussed with and agreed by ajacoutot@@ some time ago
@

@Efreet is an implementation of the following specifications from
freedesktop.org:

  * Base Directory - Locations for system and user specific
    desktop configuration files.
  * Desktop Entries - The metadata associated with the applications
    installed on a system.
  * Application Menus - The arrangement of available applications
    into a hierarchical menu.
  * Icon Themes - A means of associating icons with various objects
    on the desktop in a themable fashion.

By following these specifications, Enlightenment 0.17 uses the same
format for describing application launchers, menus and icon themes as
the GNOME, KDE and XFCE Desktop Environments. A system must only provide
a single set of this data for use with any of these desktops.
