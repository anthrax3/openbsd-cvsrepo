@$OpenBSD: patch-lib_awful_screen_lua_in,v 1.1 2013/10/07 14:28:52 dcoppa Exp $

commit a6466864f945d3a5526a89efcf31375e82969a20
Author: Uli Schlachter <psychon@@znc.in>
Date:   Fri Oct 4 11:27:35 2013 +0200

awful.screen.focus: Don't move mouse to (0, 0) first (FS#1173)

Setting mouse.screen moves the pointer to the top left corner of that screen.
However, the very next line would then move the pointer elsewhere again. Thus,
the first one wasn't needed at all.
