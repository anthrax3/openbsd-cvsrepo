1.1.1.1
log
@awesome is a window manager initially based on a dwm code rewriting.
It's extremely fast, small, dynamic and awesome.

It manages windows in several layouts mode: tiled, floating, etc.  Each
layout can be applied dynamically, optimizing the environment for the
application in use and the task performed. Every aspect of awesome is
configurable via a configuration file: awesomerc.
