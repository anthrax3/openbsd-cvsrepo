@awesome is a highly configurable, next generation framework window
manager for X. It is very fast, small, dynamic and it's heavily
extensible using the Lua programming language.
It is primarily targeted at power users, developers and anyone who
wants to have fine grained control over his graphical environment.

awesome is a window manager initially based on a dwm code rewriting.
It's extremely fast, small, dynamic and awesome.

It manages windows in several layouts mode: tiled, floating, etc.  Each
layout can be applied dynamically, optimizing the environment for the
application in use and the task performed. Every aspect of awesome is
configurable via a configuration file: awesomerc.
