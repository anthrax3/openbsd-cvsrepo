@Import of mplayer-0.90pre3 - Movie Player

MPlayer is a movie player for LINUX (runs on many other Unices, and
non-x86 CPUs, see the documentation). It plays most MPEG, VOB, AVI,
VIVO, ASF/WMV, QT/MOV, FLI, NuppelVideo, yuv4mpeg, FILM, RoQ, and some
RealMedia files, supported by many native, XAnim, and Win32 DLL codecs.
You can watch VideoCD, SVCD, DVD, 3ivx, FLI, and even DivX movies too
(and you don't need the avifile library at all!).

Submitted by Björn Sandell <biorn@@dce.chalmers.se>, work also done by me

Withstanding issues: see how to deal with optimization detection at build
time so that binary packages can be created; check make it work on
platforms other than i386, etc. things can be done in-tree.
