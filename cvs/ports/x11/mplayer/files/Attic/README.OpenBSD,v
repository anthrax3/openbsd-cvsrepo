@Update to mplayer-20101024. Noteworthy improvements include vpx
(webm) support and alpha support. This work is a joint effort from
myself, naddy@@ and jakemsr@@. Cheers.

@Possible issues with using MPlayer on OpenBSD:

all arches:
  The GUI is deprecated so we stripped it from the build. You can use
  x11/gnome-mplayer or x11/smplayer instead.

i386:
  win32 codecs were disabled in OpenBSD's build, as the open-source codecs
  are now of decent quality.

arm:
  You may encounter slow video output.  In this case you can disable
  the X.Org screen rotation in /etc/X11/xorg.conf. Depending on the
  video you are playing you may want to pass the -framedrop or the
  -hardframedrop option to mplayer.

  In order to improve vorbis performance on ARM, try using the tremor codec.
  This can be achieved using '-ac tremor'.

See the package description for a list of FLAVORs and their meaning.

@Fix Ogg demuxing by using internal Tremor implementation.

Remove pointless "mad" flavor.  On arm, we now default to the
internal ffmp3 integer decoder.

Clean up README and DESCR.

  MPlayer might fail due to lack of shared memory, e.g. when using gui
  mode under KDE.  Starting with OpenBSD 3.3, sysctl(8) can modify the
  shared memory parameters. In particular kern.shminfo.shmall might need
  to be raised, e.g. 

  # sysctl kern.shminfo.shmall=32768

  The internal mp3lib (mpg123) is disabled because it relies on the
  FPU. Instead of using mp3lib the mad flavor is enabled by default.
  If you want to use libmad as an audio decoder please pass the
  '-ac mad' option to mplayer.

@New version of mplayer based upon a snapshot (20090708).
  * fixes some flv playback
  * removed ggi output - broken i386/sparc64.
  * removed gui (deprecated) - use gnome-mplayer instead.
  * removed win32 codecs - opensource codecs are good quality.

OK, naddy@@, sthen@@

  Also note that MPlayer may sometimes fail to play a file (particularly
  WMV files) unless machdep.userldt sysctl is enabled.
