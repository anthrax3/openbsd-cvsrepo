 .SH DESCRIPTION
 x2x allows the keyboard and mouse on one ("from") X display to be used to
 control another ("to") X display.  Since x2x uses the XTEST extension,
@@@@ -17,12 +17,12 @@@@ the input focus.  Clicking on the x2x window causes th
 a subsequent multiple button click on the "to" display returns control
 to the "from" display.
 
-If the -east or -west options are specified on the command line, x2x
-starts up with a different interface.  When the mouse moves to the
-(east or west) side of the default screen on the "from" display, the
-cursor slides over to the "to" display.  When the mouse returns to
-to side of the "to" display that it entered, it slides back onto
-the "from" display.
+If the -north, -south, -east or -west options are specified on the
+command line, x2x starts up with a different interface.  When the mouse
+moves to the top, bottom, east side or west side of the default screen
+on the "from" display, the cursor slides over to the "to" display.
+When the mouse returns to to side of the "to" display that it entered,
+it slides back onto the "from" display.
 
 Unless the -nosel option is specified, x2x relays X selections from
 one display to the other.

-Ugly hack to work-around window manager ugliness.  The -east and -west
-modes actually put a small window on the side of the "from" display.
-This option causes this window to resurface itself if another window
-ever obscures it.  This option can cause really nasty behavior if another
-application tries to do the same thing.  Useful for login scripts.
