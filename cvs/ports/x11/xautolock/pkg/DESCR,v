@Xautolock  monitors  console activity  under the X window system, and
fires  up  a  program  of your choice if  nothing  happens  during  a
user configurable  period of time.  You can use this to automatically
start up a screen locker in case you tend to forget to do so manually
before having a coffee break.

Xautolock  will  typically  be used to lock the screen but it  really
doesn't care what program you make it start. The only real assumption
made  by  xautolock  is that  a new countdown  starts  as soon as the
locker exits.

Xautolock monitors the user activity on an X  Window  dis-
play.  If  none is detected within mins minutes, a program
is started as specified by the -locker  option.  Xautolock
will  typically be used to lock the screen (hence its pri-
mary name) but it really doesn't  care  what  program  you
make  it start. For this reason, xautolock does not inter-
fere with the default X screen saver, unless  the  -reset-
saver  option is used.  This implies that it is the job of
the locker or the user to take the appropriate actions  if
the default screen saver is to be disabled.  The only real
assumption made by  xautolock  is  that  a  new  countdown
starts as soon as the locker exits.
