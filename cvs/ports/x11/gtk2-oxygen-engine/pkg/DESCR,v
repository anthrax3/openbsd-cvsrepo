@Import gtk2-oxygen-theme, a port for Oxygen (default KDE) theme to GTK.

Oxygen-Gtk is a port of the default KDE widget theme (Oxygen) to GTK.

Its primary goal is to ensure visual consistency between GTK and
Qt-based applications running under KDE. A secondary objective is to
also have a stand-alone nice looking GTK theme that behaves well in
other desktop environments.

From Fabian Raetz (thank!) via ports@@, with additional tweaks and
okays from dcoppa@@, stsp@@ and me.

Also ajacoutot@@ did take care of devel/gtk+2 port documentation part.
