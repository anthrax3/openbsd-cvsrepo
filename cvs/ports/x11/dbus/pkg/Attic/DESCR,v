@Subpackage dbus into -main and -suid (which contains the
dbus-daemon-launch-helper setuid helper binary).
Applications installing files under /usr/local/share/dbus-1/system-services/
*must* now RUN_DEPENDS on x11/dbus,-suid.
This was requested by reyk@@ some time ago.

While here, rename the rc scrip to "messagebus" which is what upstream
recommends.
discussed with landry@@ and jasper@@

Bump and dependency changes coming in a few...

@D-Bus is a message bus system, a simple way for applications to talk to
one another. In addition to interprocess communication (IPC), D-Bus
helps coordinate process lifecycle; it makes it simple and reliable to
code a "single instance" application or daemon, and to launch
applications and daemons on demand when their services are needed.

D-BUS is a simple IPC library based on messages.

It replaces DCOP in kde4.

"libdbus" is intended to be a low-level API, similar to Xlib. 
Most programmers will use the bindings to GLib, Qt, Python, Mono, 
Java, or whatever.
