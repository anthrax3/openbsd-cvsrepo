@Tweak now that dbus-launch isn't called automatically by our Xsession and
Xinit.

| Running ${FULLPKGNAME} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

To start a session bus instance of dbus-daemon (needed by applications
installing ${PREFIX}/share/dbus-1/services/*.service files), add the
following lines to .xinitrc or .xsession before starting the window manager
(see dbus-launch(1) for more info) -- note that some session/login managers,
e.g. gnome-session(1) already handle this automatically.

if [ -x ${PREFIX}/bin/dbus-launch -a -z "${DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS}" ]; then
	eval `dbus-launch --sh-syntax --exit-with-session`
fi

1.1
log
@Subpackage dbus into -main and -suid (which contains the
dbus-daemon-launch-helper setuid helper binary).
Applications installing files under /usr/local/share/dbus-1/system-services/
*must* now RUN_DEPENDS on x11/dbus,-suid.
This was requested by reyk@@ some time ago.

While here, rename the rc scrip to "messagebus" which is what upstream
recommends.
discussed with landry@@ and jasper@@

Bump and dependency changes coming in a few...

following lines in .xinitrc or .xsession before starting the window
manager (see dbus-launch(1) for more info) -- note that the default
xinitrc and Xsession in OpenBSD (as well as some session/login managers,
e.g. gnome-session(1)) already do this for you in which case these lines
are not needed.
