@- minor cleanup:
* lowercase first char of COMMENT
* specify license version
* re-format DESCR
* don't lie in DESCR; xplanet doesn't do OpenGL/Mesa rendering (from stsp@@, thanks!)
* regen PLIST and WANTLIB while here

@Xplanet was inspired by Xearth, which renders an image of the earth into
the X root window. Xplanet uses the Imlib library to read user supplied
maps of the earth (or another planet). Orthographic and mercator
projections can be rendered to the root window or saved to a file.
