@PWM is a lightweight window manager for X11 with emphasis on usability.
It was the first window manager to implement "tabbed frames". This
feature helps keeping windows, especially the numerous xterms,
organized.

PWM has a clean and simple look inspired by BeOS and Motif. It does have
workspaces, menus and Window Maker dockapp support as well as good
keyboard support and almost all the functionality is configurable.

It does not have all the features (such as pixmapped themes, icons,
iconified windows or titlebar buttons) that one might expect from a
typical window manager and may not be the easiest one to get into.

PWM is a rather lightweight window manager for X11. It has the unique
feature that multiple client windows can be attached to the same frame.
This feature helps keeping windows, especially the numerous xterms,
organized. A look at the screenshots below might clarify the idea.

Being a lightweight window manager with emphasis on usability, PWM does
not have all the features that one might expect from a window manager.
Those features are simply unnecessary. PWM does not provide pixmapped
themes or other bloated eye candies but has a clean and simple look
inspired by BeOS and Motif. There are no icons and frames cannot be
iconified, only "shaded". Only One True (pointer) focus mode is supported:
sloppy. PWM does not even have titlebar buttons and may not be the easiest
window manager to get into, most Good Things are not.

PWM does have workspaces, menus and Window Maker dockapp support. It has
pretty good keyboard support and almost all the functionality is
configurable.
