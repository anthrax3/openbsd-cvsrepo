commit 103ab83131d30614ea9337e752548a834773bfc6

Revert "raise fullscreen windows on top of all other X11 windows"

This reverts commit 0659a0d98ca98fcd134c277c6a61ca3c9a04544e.

It was a fix for dzen2 setups, but broke several other use cases.
Because dzen2 is not really important since most people use i3bar
nowadays, let's revert this.
