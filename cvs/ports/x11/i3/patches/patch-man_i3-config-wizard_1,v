-i3\-config\-wizard is started by i3 in its default config, unless /\&.i3/config exists\&. i3\-config\-wizard creates a keysym based i3 config file (based on /etc/i3/config\&.keycodes) in /\&.i3/config\&.

 .sp
 The advantage of using keysyms is that the config file is easy to read, understand and modify\&. However, if we shipped with a keysym based default config file, the key positions would not be consistent across different keyboard layouts (take for example the homerow for movement)\&. Therefore, we ship with a keycode based default config and let the wizard transform it according to your current keyboard layout\&.
