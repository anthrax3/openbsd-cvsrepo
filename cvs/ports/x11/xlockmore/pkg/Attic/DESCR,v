@       xlock  locks the X server till the user enters their pass-
       word at the keyboard.  While xlock  is  running, all  new
       server  connections are refused. The screen saver is dis-
       abled.  The mouse cursor is turned  off. The  screen  is
       blanked and a changing pattern is put on the screen.  If a
       key or a mouse button is pressed then the user is prompted
       for the password of the user who started xlock.

       If  the  correct password  is  typed,  then the screen is
       unlocked and the X server is restored.   When  typing  the
       password Control-U  and  Control-H are active as kill and
       erase respectively.  To return to the locked screen, click
       in the small icon version of the changing pattern.
