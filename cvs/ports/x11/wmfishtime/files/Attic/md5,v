1.1.1.1

@The last clock dockapp you'll ever need!  Features sexy gradient
background, antialiased clock hands, alpha-blended bubbles, and
cool fish swimming around behind the clock. Displays current time
with up-to-the-second accuracy, and today's date and day of the
week. But wait, there is more! Move your mouse inside the screen,
and the fish will get scared and run away! (Only if your Window
Manager doesn't suck). Oh yeah, and it checks your mail, too!
