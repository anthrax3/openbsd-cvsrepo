@In x11/gnome ports we use disable-static inconsistently, usually to get
rid of static module archives; but since we end up manually removing the
libtool la files anyway, just don't bother setting up the tag.

@Quiet gconftool-2:
gconf_ping() will try to shutdown gconfd, but since installing pkg is
done as root, there is not gconfd nor dbus that can be started when
DISPLAY isn't set and an annoying warning is issued.

@Import gpointing-device-settings-1.5.1

GPointingDeviceSettings is a GUI tool for setting pointing device such
as TrackPoint or Touchpad. Each UI can be written as dynamic loadable
module, so a third party can add its own UI.

Based on a port from jasper@@ with tweaks by ajacoutot@@
