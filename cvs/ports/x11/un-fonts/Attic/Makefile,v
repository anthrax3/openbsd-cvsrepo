@SUBDIR += is wrong: it means the makefile will pick up SUBDIR from env, thus
breaking cd /usr/ports && SUBDIR=some/path make something for
category makefiles. While there, also put spaces around += uniformously.

log
@import x11/un-fonts, alternative Korean fonts, preferred by some over
the baekmuk fonts. original port done by Matthieu Herrb, with some reworking
by myself. commit requested by matthieu@@.

Un-fonts comes from the HLaTeX type1 fonts made in 1998 by Koaunghi Un,
he designed type1 fonts to use with Korean TeX(HLaTeX) and released them
under the GNU GPL license.

They were converted to TrueType with FontForge(PfaEdit) by Won-kyu Park
in 2003.
