@XGlobe displays the earth as seen from space on your X desktop, similar
to xearth by Kirk Lauritz Johnson. The image of the globe is updated at
regular intervals. XGlobe uses a world map image which is mapped to the
globe. With a good map this can look very nice. It is possible to mark
locations on the globe. Also look for the openbsd-developers package,
which collates the location of some of the developers.
Look at the home page of this project for a fairly extensive collection
of maps.
