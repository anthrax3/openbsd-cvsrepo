+:VDM:
+Virtual Desktop Manager
+
+The Virtual Desktop Manager (VDM) allows you to
+have 1 or more logical desktops one of which may
+be viewed at any time.  Each desktop is
+represented by a region surrounded with
+a dashed line.
+
+The background of the VDM represents the logical
+desktops which you currently have; you can
+increase or reduce this number simply by
+resizing the VDM.  If you make the VDM smaller, 
+the rightmost and bottommost desktops will
+"go away" and you will not be able to access
+any windows in that desktop.  The windows
+themselves are still active, though, and will
+appear if you again make the VDM larger.
+
+The desktop boundaries are not physical
+boundaries; a window can straddle a boundary
+and you can view portions of more that one
+desktop at a time (whatever amount that will
+fit on your screen).  Usually, though, you
+will see a logical boundary between desktops.
+
+To move to another desktop, you can use the arrow
+keys or you can double-click the SELECT button
+inside the VDM at the location you want to go to.
+Pressing MENU in the VDM brings up a menu which
+also allows you to move to a different desktop.
+
+The small windows in the desktop represent each
+frame as it appears on your screen.  In terms of
+window manager actions, they mimic the frame they
+represent:  you can select and move them with
+the SELECT button, you can bring up their
+window menu with the MENU button, you can drop
+items from other tools into them, etc.  All
+actions performed on one of these little
+windows affects the frame the window represents.
