@Initial import of gdesklets-0.35.4.

gDesklets is a system for bringing mini programs (desklets), such as
weather forecasts, news tickers, system information displays, or music
player controls, onto your desktop, where they are sitting there in a
symbiotic relationship of eye candy and usefulness. The possibilities
are really endless and they are always there to serve you whenever you
need them, just one key-press away. The system is not restricted to
one desktop environment, but currently works on most of the modern
Unix desktops (including GNOME, KDE, Xfce).

Lots of help and okay jasper@@. Thanks!
