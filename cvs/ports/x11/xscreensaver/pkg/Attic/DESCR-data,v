1.2
log
@Update to xscreensaver-5.20.
- explicitely disable PAM
- merge -data into -main; it makes no sense to split them anymore
- re-add popsquares as it doesn't conflict with gnome-screensaver anymore
@
text
@This package provides the graphical demos (i.e. savers) to screensaver
applications like xscreensaver(1) or gnome-screensaver(1).
@


1.1
log
@- split xscreensaver into 3 subpackages:
* -main for the main xscreensaver binaries
* -data for the savers than can be shared by other screensavers (like
the soon-to-be-imported gnome-screensaver)
* -gle which is a migration of the no-no_gle FLAVOR
- create .desktop files from xscreensaver xml files for use by
freedesktop compliant screensavers (scripts from gnome-screensaver)
- take maintainership
- resolve old conflict with games/circuit
