@Update to 4.21, it works better with Gnome 2.10.  Also default to gtk2 and
remove gtk1 support entirely as it makes the port a lot simpler :).

@controlcenter2 depends on xscreensaver-gtk2 and xscreensaver-gtk2 puts files
into share/control-center-2.0/capplets so xscreensaver-gtk2 needs to
own share/control-center-2.0/capplets, not the other way around.
