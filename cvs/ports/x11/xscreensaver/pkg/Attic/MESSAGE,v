log
@- split xscreensaver into 3 subpackages:
* -main for the main xscreensaver binaries
* -data for the savers than can be shared by other screensavers (like
the soon-to-be-imported gnome-screensaver)
* -gle which is a migration of the no-no_gle FLAVOR
- create .desktop files from xscreensaver xml files for use by
freedesktop compliant screensavers (scripts from gnome-screensaver)
- take maintainership
- resolve old conflict with games/circuit

@xscreensaver is not installed setuid anymore which will prevent
unlocking the screen using the root password.  If you need this behavior
back, you can add the setuid bit to the xscreensaver binary.  As root:
  chmod u+s ${PREFIX}/bin/xscreensaver

@- implement  bsd_auth(3) authentication ; benefits:
* no need to run xscreensaver setuid root anymore
* you can use whatever passwd backend you configured in login.conf(5)
  (kerberos, ldap...) to unlock the screen and not just local passwd
