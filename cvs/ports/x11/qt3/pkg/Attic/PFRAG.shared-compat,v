1.2
log
@Reorganize stuff.
- stop supporting !mt, since it has worked for a long time.
- mt becomes a pseudo_flavor for compat purposes.
- merge base back into the main module.
- link mt names to not mt names.
- finish recreating a full QTDIR structure for compatibility as well.

1.1
log
@a few tweaks:
- since we no longer compile qt3 without mt, link the files with the
`usual' names (compat settings and fragment).
- install supplementary development libraries, this will help for other
ports (asked by Steve Shockley).
- help qmake work off-the-shelf.
- provide a no_examples pseudo-flavor.

bump pkgname.
