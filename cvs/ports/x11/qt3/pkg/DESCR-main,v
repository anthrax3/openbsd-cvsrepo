@tweak DESCR slightly so that the HOMEPAGE shows up at the usual place.

@Qt is a toolkit for building a GUI for X in C++. 
There are some user documentation files in ${QT_DOC}, but
the main documentation is in the qt3-html package, 
or on the web.

There is also a qt3-examples package, that contains a tutorial and 
simple example programs (source + binaries).

There are database plugins: qt3-mysql and qt3-postgresql.

People who want to use qt3 to compile applications outside the ports tree
should note that qt3's installation conforms to OpenBSD habits, not
TrollTech's recommendations.
Accordingly:
- libs are separated from includes.
- moc is installed as ${PREFIX}/bin/moc3, in order not to conflict 
  with other qt versions.
- uic is installed as ${PREFIX}/bin/uic3

Generally, it's just a question of invoking 

env MOC=moc3 UIC=uic3 configure --with-qt-includes=${PREFIX}/include/X11/qt3 
	--with-qt-libraries=${PREFIX}/lib/qt3

Or to force MOC/UIC in your make/gmake invocation:
make MOC=moc3 UIC=uic3
will override the Makefile contents.

Warning: the qt3 library also appears under ${PREFIX}/lib, but you
*must* make sure your application sees ${PREFIX}/lib/qt3 *first*, because
${PREFIX}/lib may also contain a later incarnation of Qt, in which case 
the linker will pick up the most recent library.
