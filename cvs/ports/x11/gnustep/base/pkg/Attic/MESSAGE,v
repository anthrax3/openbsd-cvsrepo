@To be able to use gdomap(8), add the following lines to services(5):
 gdomap 538/tcp # GNUstep distrib objects
 gdomap 538/udp # GNUstep distrib objects

Then see rc(8) to have "${PREFIX}/bin/gdomap -p" launched at boot time.

To be able to fully use the GNUstep framework, you should also add the
following lines to your ~/.xsession or ~/.xinitrc:
 . ${PREFIX}/share/GNUstep/Makefiles/GNUstep.sh
 ${PREFIX}/bin/gdnc

@Import gnustep-base-1.14.0

The GNUstep Base Library is a library of general-purpose, non-graphical
Objective C objects.  For example, it includes classes for strings,
object collections, byte streams, typed coders, invocations,
notifications, notification dispatchers, moments in time, network ports,
remote object messaging support (distributed objects), and event loops.
It provides functionality that aims to implement the non-graphical
portion of the OpenStep standard (the Foundation library).
