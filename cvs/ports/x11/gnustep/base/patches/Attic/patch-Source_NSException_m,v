Fix "hang" when trying to catch exceptions, ugly hack, but fixes a lot
of problems in different applications.

1.1
log
@update gnustep-base to 1.22.1.
getting rid of two patches that made it into upstream.
Add a patch that disables the generation of backtraces, when trying to
handle exceptions, which caused hangs and 100% CPU hogging.
This makes many GNUstep applications happy, hopefully finding a better
way soon.
