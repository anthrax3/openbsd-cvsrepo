1.2

@update gnustep-base to 1.22.1.
getting rid of two patches that made it into upstream.
Add a patch that disables the generation of backtraces, when trying to
handle exceptions, which caused hangs and 100% CPU hogging.
This makes many GNUstep applications happy, hopefully finding a better
way soon.
