@MathArray is a general library of classes for performing mathematical
operations on arrays (vectors, matrices, etc) of values. It can operate
on any standard 'C' number type plus numbers of complex type. MathArray
knows implicitly what types of operations can be performed on what types
of numbers and will automatically cast itself to the correct number type
representation to handle the specific operation. Standard operations
include addition, scalar and matrix multiplication and logical
operations. Mathematical operations in the standard C math library are
also supported, as well as user-defined functions.
