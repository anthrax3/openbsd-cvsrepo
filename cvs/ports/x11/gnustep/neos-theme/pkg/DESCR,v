@The Neos theme closely follows the original NeXT look and feel. The
controls and the user interface have the same guidelines, the menus,
scrollbars and general impression are familiar to the old-style user.
The Shades are more subtle, several controls look the same, but are made
less intrusive, more subtle. Some icons are smoother.
