@Gomoku is an extended TicTacToe game for GNUstep. You win the game if
you are able to put 5 of your pieces in a row, column or diagonal. You
lose if the computer does it before you. Unlike most other engines, this
engine is not designed to play very well, but rather to give you fun
when you play against it.
