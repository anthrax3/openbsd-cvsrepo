| Running ${FULLPKGNAME} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

#
# post-install optionnal steps
#

To take advantage of all the features from the GNUstep framework, you
should add the following lines to your ~/.xsession or ~/.xinitrc:
 . ${TRUEPREFIX}/share/GNUstep/Makefiles/GNUstep.sh # (from gnustep-make)
 ${TRUEPREFIX}/bin/gdnc # notifications daemon (from gnustep-base)
 ${TRUEPREFIX}/bin/gpbs # clipboard/pasteboard daemon (from gnustep-back)
 ${TRUEPREFIX}/bin/make_services # update service cache (from gnustep-gui)

To enable gdomap(8), the distributed objects lookup daemon (from
gnustep-base), add the following lines to services(5):
 gdomap 538/tcp # GNUstep distrib objects
 gdomap 538/udp # GNUstep distrib objects

Then see rc(8) to have "${TRUEPREFIX}/bin/gdomap -p" launched at boot time.

For more Information regarding the GNUstep services see their respective
manual pages: GNUstep(7), gdnc(1), gpbs(1), make_services(1), gdomap(8)


#
# running applications
#

While opening GNUstep applications using their complete path is possible
(i.e. ${TRUEPREFIX}/libexec/GNUstep/ApplicationName.app/ApplicationName),
you're advised to use the "openapp" wrapper to do so.
For instance, to start the Calculator application, you would use:
 ${TRUEPREFIX}/bin/openapp Calculator

According to your display, you may find the fonts to be too large/small
for your taste.
To change the default fonts size ("9"), use the following command:
 ${TRUEPREFIX}/bin/defaults write NSGlobalDomain NSFontSize <fontsize>

# documentation

Official GNUstep documentations are available from this page:

log
@Update gnustep-make to 2.6.1. While there, do not disable native-objective-c
exceptions. They are not used by any port, but maybe someone wants to do it
in the future, or a port may need it.
Further, zap the stripping of binaries that gets propagated into the gnusteps
config.make to be more inline with upstream. This is now properly handled via
the gnustep.port.mk.

# debugging tools and applications

In case you do not want stripped libraries and binaries, you have to
remove the -s flag from the definition of INSTALL_PROGRAM in the 
${TRUEPREFIX}/share/GNUstep/Makefiles/config.make file.
