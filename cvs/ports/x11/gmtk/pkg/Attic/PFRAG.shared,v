@Import gmtk, the gnome-mplayer toolkit.

$ cat pkg/DESCR
gmtk is a library that is used by gnome-mplayer and gecko-mediaplayer:
several common functions and routines formerly in gnome-mplayer and
gecko-mediaplayer have been moved to this library.
gmtk can be used to build your own media players, as widgets have
been created to control mplayer: a simple media player can be built
using this library very quickly.
