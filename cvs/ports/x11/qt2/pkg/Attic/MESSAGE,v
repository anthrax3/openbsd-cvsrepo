@Update to qt2 2.0.

More patches to not build gl by default (dependency on Mesa)
and to build all examples.

Still need to investigate gnm, and check whether the gl flavor is actually
ok.

log
@Don't try to be smart with examples and tutorial, moving those files
around doesn't work, as there are cross-dependencies.

Move LOCALBASE/X11BASE setting to post-patch, as this allows having
complete, independent Makefiles for examples/tutorial.

Package the full tutorial/example along.

Install qt1 to qt2 conversion tools along.

Provide a link to /usr/local/bin/moc2, to ease getting FreeBSD ports.
