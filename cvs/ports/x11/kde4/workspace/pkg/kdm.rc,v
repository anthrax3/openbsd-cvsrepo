@Override _rc_wait(); these scripts are a bit hackish because they need
/usr/libexec/getty to be started but it is started later in the boot
process.

@Revert, this breaks rc_stop() for these daemons.
I'm working on a better fix.

@Sync rc_start() between these 3 daemons since they do the same.
Keeping the sleep 2 in kdm.rc -- not sure why this is needed, zhuk@@ probably
knows.

1.1
log
@Polish KDM support:

  * Add rc script. Just add "kdm" to pkg_scripts in rc.conf.local now.

  * Add a dirty hack for console-kit-daemon until ConsoleKit gets fixed.
    We don't support multi-seat X now anyway.

Please note: while the rc script is based on gdm.rc, it has somewhat changed
logic. So if you're using KDM, please test it in rc.conf.local before we
get to 5.5 release, to make sure it doesn't break. It shouldn't, of course,
but, you know, IT happens.
