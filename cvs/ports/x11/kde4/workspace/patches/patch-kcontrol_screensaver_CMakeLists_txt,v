@Fix problems with starting KDE session from startkde4, after discussion
on ports@@openbsd.org. Big hint received from Remco, thanks!

KDM still have some issues, mostly related to migration paths. To be fixed
soon.

Added/updated description for some patches while there.

1.1
log
@Couple of fixes for kde-workspace:
  - Avoid picking up OpenGL ES, this breaks builds of dependant ports
    after recent Mesa update.
  - Fix some checks in CMake files related to X11 and OpenGL.
  - Use Ruby 1.9 instead of 1.8, as other KDE parts do.
  - Add a note about struct ucred checks in Makefile, to save time on
    investigations later.
