1.2
log
@Maintaince update for KDE Workspaces. Fixes issues with multi-monitor
configurations and applications trying to hide themselves like KSnapshot
and Kopete.

Heads up: the KWin renaming gets reverted. The kde-workspace-4.x still
conflicts with kdebase-3.x, and this renaming causes some problems seen
by stsp@@ and others. So now things are back to normal, and after unlock
another approach will be used, that won't break user configurations.

Fix some lies in comments inside startkde4 script while there.

Big thanks to stsp@@ in debugging the issues.
