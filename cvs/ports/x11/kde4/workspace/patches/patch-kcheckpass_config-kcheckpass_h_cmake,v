1.1
log
@Finish & actually enable BSD authentication support in KDE4.
This overcomes tweaking getpw* calls: KDM and kcheckpass code did it wrong
on OpenBSD anyway (for example, compared the whole pw_passwd with "*",
instead of checking first character only). And we support other types
of password-based authentication as a bonus now (hello, login_-ldap!).

Also, we now create directory for persistent data of KDM by default,
and it's /var/kdm (previously KDM tried to access /var/lib/kdm).
The persistent data means "the name of the previous user" etc.
Previously features like "remember last user logged in" didn't work.

KDE3 bits to follow a bit later.
