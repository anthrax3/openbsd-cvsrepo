@Go is a strategic board game for two players. It is also known as igo
(Japanese), weiqi or wei ch'i (Chinese) or baduk (Korean). Go is noted
for being rich in strategic complexity despite its simple rules.

The game is played by two players who alternately place black and white
stones (playing pieces, now usually made of glass or plastic) on the
vacant intersections of a grid of 19x19 lines (9x9 or 13x13 lines for
easier flavors).
