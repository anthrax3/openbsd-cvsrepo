@"small update" (c) tedu@@

Here KDE 4.13.2 comes. Big release changelogs could be read here:

  http://www.kde.org/announcements/4.12/
  http://www.kde.org/announcements/4.13/

Critical things you should be aware of:

  1. Nepomuk is gone, it's superseeded by Baloo. Nepomuk libraries
     are still here, though, but they do rely on Baloo internally.

  2. kdnssd was renamed to zeroconf-ioslave;

  3. kwallet was renamed to kwalletmanager;

  4. Akonadi cache will be rebuilt; this could result in change
     of PIM folder indexes, which in turn could mess up your
     mail filters - beware.

  5. ... a lot of other little problems that always happen during
     update.

Things could be broken for a day or two in subtle ways - don't
hesistate on reporting them!

1.4
log
@KDE 4.11.5. Some highlights:

Three Kate plugins written in Python migrated to Python 3 and thus
are not available for the moment.

kdelibs-4.x deconflicted with kdebindings-3.x, and kde-runtime-4.x
deconflicted with kdebase-3.x. Most notable change is the renaming
of kreadconfig and kwriteconfig by appending a "4" suffix to them.
All ports in CVS and in WIP repo are checked for usage of all renamed
binaries, but anything else could be broken. Sorry.

KWin renamed in kde-workspace again, to avoid conflict with
KFourInLine.

Default dependencies that came from kde4.port.mk now have additional
restriction ",<5". KDE Frameworks won't hit CVS during current cycle
but it's better to be proactive.

1.3
log
@Move on to KDE 4.11.4.

In this release, four "fat" packages were split:

  * kdeadmin
  * kdenetwork
  * kdesdk
  * kdetoys

To make updates reliable, we provide corresponding meta-packages now.

Many new patches in x11/kde4 correspond to the linking problems detected.
Those are planned to integrate upstream but probably we'll have to keep
some of them until KDE 5.

For information about major KDE 4.11 features, look at the official site:
http://www.kde.org/announcements/4.11/

Kopete Jingle support is disabled for now, until googletalk-call gets
cured from permanent coredumping.

This update involved a lot of help and patience for my mistakes from
many people, including ajacoutot@@, espie@@, naddy@@... but most of the
times this was landry@@ who definitely deserves personal "thank you"!

log
@Bugfix update KDE4 to 4.10.3 version, including some tweaks:

  * Bump all SHARED_LIBS to 50.0, to avoid future clashes with KDE3
    libraries (based on input from espie@@);
  * Enable support for Telepathy in kdenetwork (see recently committed
    net/telepathy/telepathy-qt);
  * Fix build of analitza when GNU readline is installed (thanks kirby@@
    for pointing to GNU readline issue in general).
