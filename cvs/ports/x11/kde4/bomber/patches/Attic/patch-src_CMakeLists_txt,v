@"small update" (c) tedu@@

Here KDE 4.13.2 comes. Big release changelogs could be read here:

  http://www.kde.org/announcements/4.12/
  http://www.kde.org/announcements/4.13/

Critical things you should be aware of:

  1. Nepomuk is gone, it's superseeded by Baloo. Nepomuk libraries
     are still here, though, but they do rely on Baloo internally.

  2. kdnssd was renamed to zeroconf-ioslave;

  3. kwallet was renamed to kwalletmanager;

  4. Akonadi cache will be rebuilt; this could result in change
     of PIM folder indexes, which in turn could mess up your
     mail filters - beware.

  5. ... a lot of other little problems that always happen during
     update.

Things could be broken for a day or two in subtle ways - don't
hesistate on reporting them!

1.1
log
@KDE 4.11.5. Some highlights:

Three Kate plugins written in Python migrated to Python 3 and thus
are not available for the moment.

kdelibs-4.x deconflicted with kdebindings-3.x, and kde-runtime-4.x
deconflicted with kdebase-3.x. Most notable change is the renaming
of kreadconfig and kwriteconfig by appending a "4" suffix to them.
All ports in CVS and in WIP repo are checked for usage of all renamed
binaries, but anything else could be broken. Sorry.

KWin renamed in kde-workspace again, to avoid conflict with
KFourInLine.

Default dependencies that came from kde4.port.mk now have additional
restriction ",<5". KDE Frameworks won't hit CVS during current cycle
but it's better to be proactive.
