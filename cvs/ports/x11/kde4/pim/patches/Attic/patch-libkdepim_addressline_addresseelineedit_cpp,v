1.2
log
@Maintaince update of some KDE4 components, brought to you (mostly) by
KDE PIM team.

Includes update of Grantlee to 0.5.0, last KDE4 release; previous version,
0.3.0, was too old for new kdepim. Separate update will be problematic
because PLIST of kdepim package relies on minor version of Grantlee.

Lightly tested on amd64.
