@KSudoku is a logic-based symbol placement puzzle. The player has
to fill a grid with symbols so that each column, row and block on
the game board contains only one instance of each symbol. In KSudoku
the symbols are usually the numbers 1 to 9, but may be the letters
A to P or A to Y in larger puzzles. Puzzles start with the board
partially filled and it is your job to fill in the rest.
