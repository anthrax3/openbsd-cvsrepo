@"small update" (c) tedu@@

Here KDE 4.13.2 comes. Big release changelogs could be read here:

  http://www.kde.org/announcements/4.12/
  http://www.kde.org/announcements/4.13/

Critical things you should be aware of:

  1. Nepomuk is gone, it's superseeded by Baloo. Nepomuk libraries
     are still here, though, but they do rely on Baloo internally.

  2. kdnssd was renamed to zeroconf-ioslave;

  3. kwallet was renamed to kwalletmanager;

  4. Akonadi cache will be rebuilt; this could result in change
     of PIM folder indexes, which in turn could mess up your
     mail filters - beware.

  5. ... a lot of other little problems that always happen during
     update.

Things could be broken for a day or two in subtle ways - don't
hesistate on reporting them!

1.1.1.1
log
@Amor is an acronym which stands for Amusing Misuse of Resources.
It is actually an animation which sits on top of your active window.
In its default configuration, Amor takes the form of a yellow spot
which performs many tricks.  Amor also has many different themes
which change the appearance and behavior of the animation.

This is ex-kdetoys member. Importing as a part of KDE 4.11.4 update.
This port won't work until update is finished, thus not hooking it up.
