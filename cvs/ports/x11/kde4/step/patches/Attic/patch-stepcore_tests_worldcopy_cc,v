@"small update" (c) tedu@@

Here KDE 4.13.2 comes. Big release changelogs could be read here:

  http://www.kde.org/announcements/4.12/
  http://www.kde.org/announcements/4.13/

Critical things you should be aware of:

  1. Nepomuk is gone, it's superseeded by Baloo. Nepomuk libraries
     are still here, though, but they do rely on Baloo internally.

  2. kdnssd was renamed to zeroconf-ioslave;

  3. kwallet was renamed to kwalletmanager;

  4. Akonadi cache will be rebuilt; this could result in change
     of PIM folder indexes, which in turn could mess up your
     mail filters - beware.

  5. ... a lot of other little problems that always happen during
     update.

Things could be broken for a day or two in subtle ways - don't
hesistate on reporting them!

@Step is an interactive physics simulator. It works like this: you
place some bodies on the scene, add some forces such as gravity or
springs, then click "Simulate" and Step shows you how your scene
will evolve according to the laws of physics. You can change every
property of bodies/forces in your experiment (even during simulation)
and see how this will change the outcome of the experiment. With
Step you can not only learn but feel how physics works.
