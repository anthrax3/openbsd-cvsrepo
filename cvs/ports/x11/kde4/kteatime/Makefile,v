@"small update" (c) tedu@@

Here KDE 4.13.2 comes. Big release changelogs could be read here:

  http://www.kde.org/announcements/4.12/
  http://www.kde.org/announcements/4.13/

Critical things you should be aware of:

  1. Nepomuk is gone, it's superseeded by Baloo. Nepomuk libraries
     are still here, though, but they do rely on Baloo internally.

  2. kdnssd was renamed to zeroconf-ioslave;

  3. kwallet was renamed to kwalletmanager;

  4. Akonadi cache will be rebuilt; this could result in change
     of PIM folder indexes, which in turn could mess up your
     mail filters - beware.

  5. ... a lot of other little problems that always happen during
     update.

Things could be broken for a day or two in subtle ways - don't
hesistate on reporting them!

log
@KTeaTime is a handy timer for steeping tea. No longer will you have
to guess at how long it takes for your tea to be ready. Simply s
elect the type of tea you have, and it will alert you when the tea
is ready to drink.

This is ex-kdetoys member. Importing as a part of KDE 4.11.4 update.
This port won't work until update is finished, thus not hooking it up.
