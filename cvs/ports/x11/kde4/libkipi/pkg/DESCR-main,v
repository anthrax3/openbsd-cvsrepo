log
@Commit right versions of libkdcraw and libkipi before bulks break.

Thanks to nigel@@ for testing previous, simplier, variant, that had to go
in trash.

As a bonus we now have totally independent libkdcraw and libkipi, but there
should be some more work done until they could be installed simultaneously.

@Kipi (KDE Image Plugin Interface) is an effort to develop a common
plugin structure for Digikam, KimDaBa, Showimg and Gwenview. Its
aim is to share image plugins among graphic applications. Kipi is
based on the old digiKam plugins implementation and is maintained
by digiKam team.
