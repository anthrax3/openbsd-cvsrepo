1.4
log
@Move on to KDE 4.11.4.

In this release, four "fat" packages were split:

  * kdeadmin
  * kdenetwork
  * kdesdk
  * kdetoys

To make updates reliable, we provide corresponding meta-packages now.

Many new patches in x11/kde4 correspond to the linking problems detected.
Those are planned to integrate upstream but probably we'll have to keep
some of them until KDE 5.

For information about major KDE 4.11 features, look at the official site:
http://www.kde.org/announcements/4.11/

Kopete Jingle support is disabled for now, until googletalk-call gets
cured from permanent coredumping.

This update involved a lot of help and patience for my mistakes from
many people, including ajacoutot@@, espie@@, naddy@@... but most of the
times this was landry@@ who definitely deserves personal "thank you"!

log
@Fix compilation of krossqtsplugin after recent changes in CMake. This is
actually a plugin (see kdepim-runtime), so it should be created with
KDE4_ADD_PLUGIN instead of KDE4_ADD_LIBRARY. Looks like it was done other
way to help linking problems for tests. I'll look there more later, now
it's time to at least unbreak kdelibs.

Initially notfied by Scott McEachern on ports@@, prodded by espie@@ too.
