1.2
log
@Update to KDE 4.10.5. Some highlights:
  * @@conflict markers relative to KDE3 packages added, to be used soon.
  * Migration to Ruby 1.9 for corresponding ports. Also added @@pkgpath to
    x11/ruby-qt4 in x11/kde4/ruby-qt, because they are really the same
    (except that x11/ruby-qt4 contains also smokegen and smokeqt stuff).
  * kde-base-artwork and kde-wallpapers leaved at 4.10.4 because they:
    1) did not change; 2) are heavy enough.

1.1.1.1
log
@KmPlot is a mathematical function plotter for the KDE.

It has built in a powerfull parser. You can plot different functions
simultaneously and combine their function terms to build new
functions. KmPlot supports functions with parameters and functions
in polar coordinates. Several grid modes are possible. Plots may
be printed with high precision in correct scale.
