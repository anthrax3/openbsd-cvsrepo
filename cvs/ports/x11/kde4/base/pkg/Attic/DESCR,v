@Oops, forgot to remove one more gone package.

@Base kde applications. Selected highlights:

* dolphin
    The new kde4 file manager.

* drkonqi
    If ever an app crashes (heaven forbid!) then Dr.Konqi will be so kind
    and make a stack trace. This is a great help for the developers to fix
    the bug.

* kappfinder
    Searches for non-KDE applications, e.g. Acrobat Reader (tm) and installs
    those apps under the K start button.

* kate
    A fast and advanced text editor, extensible with nice plugins.

* kcontrol
    The KDE Control Center allows you to tweak the KDE settings (non fonctional
    in this snapshot).

* kdebugdialog
    Allows you to specify which debug messages you want to see.

* kdialog
    Allows to display menu boxes from shell scripts.

* kdm
    Replacement for XDM, for those people that like graphical logins.

* kfind
    File find utility (standalone and in Konqueror's file manager).

* khelpcenter
    Used to to read all great documentation about KDE, unix man pages,
    info pages etc (lots of quirks still)

* kicker
    The panel at the botton with the K start button and the taskbar etc.

* klipper
    Taskbar applet that enhances and extenses the X clipboard.

* konqueror
    The file manager and web browser you get easily used to.

* konsole
    A shell program similar to xterm.

* kreadconfig
    A tool for shell scripts to get info from KDE's config files.

* krichtexteditor
    A embeddable rich text editor and a wrapper application for it.

* kscreensaver
    The KDE screensaver environment and some basic screensavers. More
    of them are in the kdeartwork package.

* ksysguard
    Task manager and system monitor, can work with remote systems.

* kwin
    The KDE window manager (moves, resizes and decorates windows).

@partial port of the kde4 beta.
this is totally experimental and not working yet !
it's in so that experimental people can look at it and play with it.
do not even think of building it if you don't know what you're doing.
