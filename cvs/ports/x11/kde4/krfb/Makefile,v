@Use "net" instead of "network" in CATEGORIES; noticed by jasper@@, thanks!

Fix RUN_DEPENDS in kget while there.

@Security fix for krfb 4.13 branch, CVE-2014-4607:

krfb embeds libvncserver which embeds liblzo2, it contains various flaws
that result in integer overflow problems.

This commit actually updates bundled lzo library, as suggested by upstream.

@"small update" (c) tedu@@

Here KDE 4.13.2 comes. Big release changelogs could be read here:

  http://www.kde.org/announcements/4.12/
  http://www.kde.org/announcements/4.13/

Critical things you should be aware of:

  1. Nepomuk is gone, it's superseeded by Baloo. Nepomuk libraries
     are still here, though, but they do rely on Baloo internally.

  2. kdnssd was renamed to zeroconf-ioslave;

  3. kwallet was renamed to kwalletmanager;

  4. Akonadi cache will be rebuilt; this could result in change
     of PIM folder indexes, which in turn could mess up your
     mail filters - beware.

  5. ... a lot of other little problems that always happen during
     update.

Things could be broken for a day or two in subtle ways - don't
hesistate on reporting them!

1.1.1.1
log
@KDE Desktop Sharing (krfb)  is a small server for the RFB protocol,
better known as VNC. Unlike most other Unix/Linux RFB servers, KRfb
allows you to share your X11 session instead of creating a new X11
session.  It uses libvncserver as backend.

This is ex-kdenetwork member. Importing as a part of KDE 4.11.4 update.
This port won't work until update is finished, thus not hooking it up.
