@Fix WANTLIB and bump REVISION for all ports depending on hunspell.

While here enforce dependency on hunspell 1.6 in mozilla.port.mk, as
it's a requirement for 53.

@"small update" (c) tedu@@

Here KDE 4.13.2 comes. Big release changelogs could be read here:

  http://www.kde.org/announcements/4.12/
  http://www.kde.org/announcements/4.13/

Critical things you should be aware of:

  1. Nepomuk is gone, it's superseeded by Baloo. Nepomuk libraries
     are still here, though, but they do rely on Baloo internally.

  2. kdnssd was renamed to zeroconf-ioslave;

  3. kwallet was renamed to kwalletmanager;

  4. Akonadi cache will be rebuilt; this could result in change
     of PIM folder indexes, which in turn could mess up your
     mail filters - beware.

  5. ... a lot of other little problems that always happen during
     update.

Things could be broken for a day or two in subtle ways - don't
hesistate on reporting them!

1.1.1.1
log
@Lokalize is a computer-aided translation system that focuses on
productivity and quality assurance.  It has components usually
included in CAT tools like translation memory, glossary, and also
a unique translation merging (synchronization) capability.  It is
targeted for software translation and also integrates external
conversion tools for freelance office document translation.

This is ex-kdesdk member. Importing as a part of KDE 4.11.4 update.
This port won't work until update is finished, thus not hooking it up.
