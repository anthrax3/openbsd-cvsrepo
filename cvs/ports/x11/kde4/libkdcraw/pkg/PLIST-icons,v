@Tweak conflict markers more: the conflict between libkdcraw and kdelibs was
caused by share/apps/cmake/modules/FindKdcraw.cmake being supplied by both
packages. So:
  1) -icons does not need to have this @@conflict at all.
  2) -main should not conflict with kdelibs-3.x and older.

@Commit right versions of libkdcraw and libkipi before bulks break.

Thanks to nigel@@ for testing previous, simplier, variant, that had to go
in trash.

As a bonus we now have totally independent libkdcraw and libkipi, but there
should be some more work done until they could be installed simultaneously.
