@"small update" (c) tedu@@

Here KDE 4.13.2 comes. Big release changelogs could be read here:

  http://www.kde.org/announcements/4.12/
  http://www.kde.org/announcements/4.13/

Critical things you should be aware of:

  1. Nepomuk is gone, it's superseeded by Baloo. Nepomuk libraries
     are still here, though, but they do rely on Baloo internally.

  2. kdnssd was renamed to zeroconf-ioslave;

  3. kwallet was renamed to kwalletmanager;

  4. Akonadi cache will be rebuilt; this could result in change
     of PIM folder indexes, which in turn could mess up your
     mail filters - beware.

  5. ... a lot of other little problems that always happen during
     update.

Things could be broken for a day or two in subtle ways - don't
hesistate on reporting them!

1.1.1.1
log
@Kopete is an instant messenger supporting AIM, Bonjour, Gadu-Gadu,
GroupWise, ICQ, Jabber (XMPP, Google Talk, Facebook, ...), Meanwhile,
QQ, Skype, Windows Live Messenger, WinPopup, Yahoo and more. It is
designed to be a flexible and extensible multi-protocol system
suitable for personal and enterprise use.

The goal of Kopete is to provide users with a single easy-to-use
way to access all of their instant messaging systems. The interface
puts people first, and is integrated with the system address book
to let you access your contacts from other KDE applications. Instant
messaging can be intrusive, but Kopete's notification system can
be tuned so that only important contacts interrupt you.

Kopete also features tools to enhance your instant messaging
experience, such as message encryption, archiving, and many other
fun and useful effects.

This is ex-kdenetwork member. Importing as a part of KDE 4.11.4 update.
This port won't work until update is finished, thus not hooking it up.
