@"small update" (c) tedu@@

Here KDE 4.13.2 comes. Big release changelogs could be read here:

  http://www.kde.org/announcements/4.12/
  http://www.kde.org/announcements/4.13/

Critical things you should be aware of:

  1. Nepomuk is gone, it's superseeded by Baloo. Nepomuk libraries
     are still here, though, but they do rely on Baloo internally.

  2. kdnssd was renamed to zeroconf-ioslave;

  3. kwallet was renamed to kwalletmanager;

  4. Akonadi cache will be rebuilt; this could result in change
     of PIM folder indexes, which in turn could mess up your
     mail filters - beware.

  5. ... a lot of other little problems that always happen during
     update.

Things could be broken for a day or two in subtle ways - don't
hesistate on reporting them!

1.1.1.1
log
@SMOKE is a introspective wrapper around the Qt and KDE frameworks.
Legend has it that SMOKE stands for Scripting Meta Object Kompiler
Engine.

Information about all classes and all methods/functions is stored
in cross-referencing tables for fast look-ups. Thereby the whole
API of a wrapped library can be used.

The main purpose of SMOKE is making it easier to write bindings
from scripting languages to Qt and KDE - with an emphasis on ease
of use and flexibility.

This package contains wrappers for Qt, and does not depend on KDE
in any way.

NB: This could conflict with x11/ruby-qt4, paths to fix this are
investigated.
