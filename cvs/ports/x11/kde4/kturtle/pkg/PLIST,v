@Update to KDE 4.10.5. Some highlights:
  * @@conflict markers relative to KDE3 packages added, to be used soon.
  * Migration to Ruby 1.9 for corresponding ports. Also added @@pkgpath to
    x11/ruby-qt4 in x11/kde4/ruby-qt, because they are really the same
    (except that x11/ruby-qt4 contains also smokegen and smokeqt stuff).
  * kde-base-artwork and kde-wallpapers leaved at 4.10.4 because they:
    1) did not change; 2) are heavy enough.

@KTurtle is an educational programming environment for the KDE
Desktop. KTurtle aims to make programming as easy and touchable as
possible, and therefore can be used to teach kids the basics of
math, geometry and... programming.

The programming language used in KTurtle is loosely based on Logo.
KTurtle allows, just like some implementations of Logo, to translate
the programming language (the commands, the documentation and the
error messages) to the native language of the programmer. For more
information on translating KTurtle please read the translation how
to. Translating the programming language to the native language of
the programmer is one of the many ways KTurtle tries to make learning
to programming more simple. Other features to help to achieve this
goal are: intuitive syntax highlighting, simple error messages,
integrated canvas to make drawings on, integrated help function,
slow-motion or step execution, and more.
