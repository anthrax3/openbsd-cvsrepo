@KJumpingCube is a simple tactical game. You can play it against the
computer or a friend - or you can set up a game between two computer
players and just watch.

The playing area is a box of cubes containing points. When the game
starts each cube has one point, no owner and a neutral color. If
you click on a neutral cube it becomes yours, changes to your color
and increases by one point. Your objective is to capture all the
cubes, but now it is your opponent's turn.
