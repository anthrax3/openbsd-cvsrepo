@Rocs aims to be a Graph Theory IDE for helping professors to show
the results of a graph algorithm and also helping students to do
the algorithms. Rocs has a scripting module, done in Qt Script,
that interacts with the drawn graph and every change in the graph
with the script is reflected on the drawn one.
