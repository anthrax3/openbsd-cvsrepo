@Update KDE 4 infrastructure.

@This is completely experimental! This is here so that people can
play with it.

Things *will* break!  This is totally expected. Dependencies are still
incomplete.

There are issues in KDE proper (it's released, but it's still early
days yet for KDE4), and some issues related to OpenBSD.

Also, this KDE4 will leave you with quite a few processes lying around
when you've played with it.

It should be obvious, but the list of things to be done is too long to
maintain; just find something that doesn't work for you, fix it, and 
post a "cvs diff -u" to ports@@.

beta), and some issues related to OpenBSD.

For now, the most annoying issue is that cmake does not handle our shared
libraries correctly *at all*.

So, the library dependencies between stuff within kde are broken so far.

@partial port of the kde4 beta.
this is totally experimental and not working yet !
it's in so that experimental people can look at it and play with it.
