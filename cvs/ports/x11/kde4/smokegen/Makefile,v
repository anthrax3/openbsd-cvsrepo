@"small update" (c) tedu@@

Here KDE 4.13.2 comes. Big release changelogs could be read here:

  http://www.kde.org/announcements/4.12/
  http://www.kde.org/announcements/4.13/

Critical things you should be aware of:

  1. Nepomuk is gone, it's superseeded by Baloo. Nepomuk libraries
     are still here, though, but they do rely on Baloo internally.

  2. kdnssd was renamed to zeroconf-ioslave;

  3. kwallet was renamed to kwalletmanager;

  4. Akonadi cache will be rebuilt; this could result in change
     of PIM folder indexes, which in turn could mess up your
     mail filters - beware.

  5. ... a lot of other little problems that always happen during
     update.

Things could be broken for a day or two in subtle ways - don't
hesistate on reporting them!

@Move on to KDE 4.11.4.

In this release, four "fat" packages were split:

  * kdeadmin
  * kdenetwork
  * kdesdk
  * kdetoys

To make updates reliable, we provide corresponding meta-packages now.

Many new patches in x11/kde4 correspond to the linking problems detected.
Those are planned to integrate upstream but probably we'll have to keep
some of them until KDE 5.

For information about major KDE 4.11 features, look at the official site:
http://www.kde.org/announcements/4.11/

Kopete Jingle support is disabled for now, until googletalk-call gets
cured from permanent coredumping.

This update involved a lot of help and patience for my mistakes from
many people, including ajacoutot@@, espie@@, naddy@@... but most of the
times this was landry@@ who definitely deserves personal "thank you"!

@Bugfix update KDE4 to 4.10.3 version, including some tweaks:

  * Bump all SHARED_LIBS to 50.0, to avoid future clashes with KDE3
    libraries (based on input from espie@@);
  * Enable support for Telepathy in kdenetwork (see recently committed
    net/telepathy/telepathy-qt);
  * Fix build of analitza when GNU readline is installed (thanks kirby@@
    for pointing to GNU readline issue in general).

@SMOKE is a introspective wrapper around the Qt and KDE frameworks.
Legend has it that SMOKE stands for Scripting Meta Object Kompiler
Engine.

Information about all classes and all methods/functions is stored
in cross-referencing tables for fast look-ups. Thereby the whole
API of a wrapped library can be used.

The main purpose of SMOKE is making it easier to write bindings
from scripting languages to Qt and KDE - with an emphasis on ease
of use and flexibility.

This package contains generator used for creating actual wrappers.
