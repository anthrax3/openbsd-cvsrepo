@Lieutenant Skat (from German Offiziersskat) is a fun and engaging
card game for two players, where the second player is either live
opponent, or built in artificial intelligence.

The game is played using a single deck of cards. Cards are shuffled
and distributed amongst the players in such a way that half of them
are face down and half of them are open. Each participant plays one
of the open cards per turn. As soon as all the cards are played the
round ends and points are calculated and awarded.
