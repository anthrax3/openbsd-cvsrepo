@"small update" (c) tedu@@

Here KDE 4.13.2 comes. Big release changelogs could be read here:

  http://www.kde.org/announcements/4.12/
  http://www.kde.org/announcements/4.13/

Critical things you should be aware of:

  1. Nepomuk is gone, it's superseeded by Baloo. Nepomuk libraries
     are still here, though, but they do rely on Baloo internally.

  2. kdnssd was renamed to zeroconf-ioslave;

  3. kwallet was renamed to kwalletmanager;

  4. Akonadi cache will be rebuilt; this could result in change
     of PIM folder indexes, which in turn could mess up your
     mail filters - beware.

  5. ... a lot of other little problems that always happen during
     update.

Things could be broken for a day or two in subtle ways - don't
hesistate on reporting them!

@Move on to KDE 4.11.4.

In this release, four "fat" packages were split:

  * kdeadmin
  * kdenetwork
  * kdesdk
  * kdetoys

To make updates reliable, we provide corresponding meta-packages now.

Many new patches in x11/kde4 correspond to the linking problems detected.
Those are planned to integrate upstream but probably we'll have to keep
some of them until KDE 5.

For information about major KDE 4.11 features, look at the official site:
http://www.kde.org/announcements/4.11/

Kopete Jingle support is disabled for now, until googletalk-call gets
cured from permanent coredumping.

This update involved a lot of help and patience for my mistakes from
many people, including ajacoutot@@, espie@@, naddy@@... but most of the
times this was landry@@ who definitely deserves personal "thank you"!

@Split some locale-specific files out of kdelibs, kdebase and kde-runtime
into some sort of interchangeable subpackages. The idea is that each version
of KDE being installed picks up it's own version of locale-specific package
by default, and KDE4's one doesn't update to KDE3's one automatically, but
can replace it on explicit pkg_add call.

Most of the Makefiles are bumps needed after splitting x11/kde4/libs.

This is a part of KDE3/4 deconflicting work.

hardly tested by landry@@ in a bulk build

@Update to KDE 4.10.5. Some highlights:
  * @@conflict markers relative to KDE3 packages added, to be used soon.
  * Migration to Ruby 1.9 for corresponding ports. Also added @@pkgpath to
    x11/ruby-qt4 in x11/kde4/ruby-qt, because they are really the same
    (except that x11/ruby-qt4 contains also smokegen and smokeqt stuff).
  * kde-base-artwork and kde-wallpapers leaved at 4.10.4 because they:
    1) did not change; 2) are heavy enough.

@Bugfix update KDE4 to 4.10.3 version, including some tweaks:

  * Bump all SHARED_LIBS to 50.0, to avoid future clashes with KDE3
    libraries (based on input from espie@@);
  * Enable support for Telepathy in kdenetwork (see recently committed
    net/telepathy/telepathy-qt);
  * Fix build of analitza when GNU readline is installed (thanks kirby@@
    for pointing to GNU readline issue in general).
