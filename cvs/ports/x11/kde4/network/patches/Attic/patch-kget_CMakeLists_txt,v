@kdenetwork-4.x tweaks:
  - Make sure -fexceptions flag is propagated correctly.
  - Backport libotr-4.x support from upstream.
  - Install Strigi torrent analyzer: we always happy to provide your
    foot with a gun, and it was built anyway.

1.1
log
@Update to KDE 4.10.5. Some highlights:
  * @@conflict markers relative to KDE3 packages added, to be used soon.
  * Migration to Ruby 1.9 for corresponding ports. Also added @@pkgpath to
    x11/ruby-qt4 in x11/kde4/ruby-qt, because they are really the same
    (except that x11/ruby-qt4 contains also smokegen and smokeqt stuff).
  * kde-base-artwork and kde-wallpapers leaved at 4.10.4 because they:
    1) did not change; 2) are heavy enough.
