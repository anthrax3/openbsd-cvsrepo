@Update to KDE 4.10.5. Some highlights:
  * @@conflict markers relative to KDE3 packages added, to be used soon.
  * Migration to Ruby 1.9 for corresponding ports. Also added @@pkgpath to
    x11/ruby-qt4 in x11/kde4/ruby-qt, because they are really the same
    (except that x11/ruby-qt4 contains also smokegen and smokeqt stuff).
  * kde-base-artwork and kde-wallpapers leaved at 4.10.4 because they:
    1) did not change; 2) are heavy enough.

@KHangMan is the classical hangman game. The child should guess a
word letter by letter. At each miss, the picture of a hangman
appears. After 10 tries, if the word is not guessed, the game is
over and the answer is displayed.  A hint can be shown to help you
guess the word.

The words are nouns and available in several languages at the moment
including English US, Bulgarian, Catalan, Czech, Danish, German,
Greek, British English, Spanish, Estonian, Finnish, French, Irish
(Gaelic), Hungarian, Italian, Norwegian (Bokml), Dutch, Norwegian
(Nynorsk), Occitan, Punjabi, Polish, Portuguese, Brazilian Portuguese,
Russian, Slovenian, Serbian, Slovak, Swedish, Tajik, Turkish and
Ukrainian. The program will detect which languages are present and
enable them. You will also be able to easily download other languages
via the Get New Stuff dialog.

There are at least 4 categories per language: easy, medium, hard
and animals which contains only animals nouns.
