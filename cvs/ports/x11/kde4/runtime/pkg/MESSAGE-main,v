@I don't want anyone repeat trial and error I did, so mention minimum
per-process open files limit needed for KDE4 to operate together with
sysctl limits.
@
text
@KDE apps actively use shared memory and open many file descriptors.
So you'll need to tweak sysctl values like that:

  sysctl kern.shminfo.shmall=51200 kern.shminfo.shmmni=1024
  sysctl kern.maxfiles=20000

Remember to save those values in /etc/sysctl.conf after successful testing.

Per-process open files limit should be at least 4000 due to the kded4
file monitoring technique.

@Warn about large file descriptors consumption by KDE, too.

There are plans to lower it but don't hold your breath yet.

log
@Split some locale-specific files out of kdelibs, kdebase and kde-runtime
into some sort of interchangeable subpackages. The idea is that each version
of KDE being installed picks up it's own version of locale-specific package
by default, and KDE4's one doesn't update to KDE3's one automatically, but
can replace it on explicit pkg_add call.

Most of the Makefiles are bumps needed after splitting x11/kde4/libs.

This is a part of KDE3/4 deconflicting work.
