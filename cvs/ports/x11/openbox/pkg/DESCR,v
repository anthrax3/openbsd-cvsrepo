@Openbox is a standards compliant, fast, light-weight, extensible window
manager.

Openbox works with your applications, and makes your desktop easier to
manage. This is because the approach to its development was the opposite
of what seems to be the general case for window managers.  Openbox was
written first to comply with standards and to work properly. Only when
that was in place did the team turn to the visual interface.

Openbox is fully functional as a stand-alone working environment, or can
be used as a drop-in replacement for the default window manager in the
GNOME or KDE desktop environments.

Openbox is a window manager for the X11 windowing system. It was originally
based on Blackbox and currently remains very similar, even using Blackbox
styles for its themeing.

Openbox is written to be fast. It is designed to be both fast in functionality
and in performance. Meaning that you, as a user, can do what you want quickly,
and the window manager will respond quickly to your every request.

Another goal of Openbox is to be usable. What good is a piece of software if
it is hard to use and, then ends up going unused. Openbox aims to take its
original codebase to the next level. To make everything - from shading a
window to configuring the window manager - easier. But to do this while
maintaining the bloat-free approach that has been present in Blackbox from
the beginning. To present a slim, speedy, attractive
window-manager-alternative for everybody.
