| Running ${FULLPKGNAME} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The licensing of OpenMotif is a bit weird. The actual copyright refers
to the web site, which is quite nasty, as they can come back and change
the licence when they want.

This port works around that problem by grabbing the licensing at the time
of build and including it in the actual package.
