@move pbrowser to the attic, last real update was in 2005, it's not LP64
safe (segfaults at startup) which nobody has reported, so seems unlikely
that it's getting much use, unknown whether it still works with a current
ports tree which has moved on quite a lot in that time.  ok jca@@ zhuk@@

@The pbrowser is a graphical frontend for the ports(7) system. It allows
for easy browsing through the ports tree and offers search facilities to
a certain extent (e.g. search for all packages which depend on package
glib-2.0 etc.).

pbrowser also allows the user to install either prebuilt packages or to
install from the ports(7) system. There are also two possibilities for
the removal of installed packages allowing the user to either remove a
package with all of the packages which depend on it, or to quit the pro-
cess of removal if other packages depend on the package to be removed.
