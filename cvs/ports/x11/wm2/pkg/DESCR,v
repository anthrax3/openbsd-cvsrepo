@wm2 is a window manager for X.  It provides an unusual style of window
decoration and as little functionality as I feel comfortable with in a
window manager.  wm2 is not configurable, except by editing the source
and recompiling the code, and is really intended for people who don't
particularly want their window manager to be too friendly.

@wm2 -- a window manager

import of wm2 into the ports tree to settle it for an eventual integration
into the x tree - my first port - would be nice if any of the port gurus
may have a look at it if it's "perfect" from the style :-)
