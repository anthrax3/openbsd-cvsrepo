@herbstluftwm is a manual tiling window manager for X11 using Xlib and
Glib. Its main features:

* layout is based on splitting frames into subframes which can be
split again or can be filled with windows (similar to i3/musca)

* tags (or workspaces or virtual desktops or ...) can be added/removed
at runtime. Each tag contains an own layout

* exactly one tag is viewed on each monitor. The tags are monitor
independent (similar to xmonad)

* it is configured at runtime via ipc calls from herbstclient. So the
configuration file is just a script which is run on startup. (similar
to wmii/musca)
