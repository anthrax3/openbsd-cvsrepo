@Update to GTK+ 2.8.6

2.8 series release notes here:
http://mail.gnome.org/archives/gnome-announce-list/2005-August/msg00054.html

NOTE: GTK+ now uses the Cairo vector graphic library as well as depending
on a version of Pango with it as well.  This will at a minimum require
chanes to the WANTLIBS of depending ports.
