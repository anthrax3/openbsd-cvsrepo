@Re-instate the -cups subpackage so that gtk+2 does not need to depends on
gnutls nor avahi.
There might be some breakage due to induced dependencies but it'll be fixed
shortly.

Default theme
=============
The default GTK+ theme engine can be modified by editing:
    ~/.gtkrc-2.0
and appending a line similar to:
include "${LOCALBASE}/share/themes/oxygen-gtk/gtk-2.0/gtkrc"

Some themes are available as packages ("gtk2-*-engine").

Printing
========

Preview
-------
By default, GTK+ uses the "evince" command from the evince package to
display a "Print Preview". This can be modified by editing:
    ~/.gtkrc-2.0
and appending the following line:
gtk-print-preview-command = "epdfview %f"

(epdfview can be replaced by any other PDF viewer command like xpdf...)

Note that by default, "evince" will remove the temporary PDF preview
file (/tmp/previewXXXXX.pdf) when done, that might not be the case with
other PDF viewers.

CUPS
----
Printing to CUPS requires installing the gtk+2-cups package.
