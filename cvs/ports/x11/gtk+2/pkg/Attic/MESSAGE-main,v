@gtk+2-2.22.0 is more picky about missing icons.
Work around this by installing, alongside gnome-icon-theme, a system-wide
gtkrc containing the line:

gtk-icon-theme-name="gnome"

This avoids assertion failures regarding missing icons with GTK+
applications when executed outside of a Desktop Environment like GNOME
or XFCE.

Also remove x11/gtk+2/pkg/MESSAGE-main which is no longer needed.

@Some gtk+2 applications (notably GNOME ones), when run standalone
outside of a Desktop Environment will not display icons unless an icon
theme is configured. You can setup one adding a line to ~/.gtkrc-2.0.
    e.g. gtk-icon-theme-name="gnome"

@Some gtk+2 applications when run outside a full blown DE (most notably
GNOME ones) will require a configured icon theme to properly display
icons, so teach users how to do it.

If you intend to run GNOME applications outside of GNOME, you need to
setup a default gtk+2 icon theme by adding a line in ~/.gtkrc-2.0.
