@I've been handling the gdk-pixbuf.loaders and gtk.immodules files all
wrong.  These are generated files that should be updated automagically by
ports whenever GDK loaders or GTK immodules respectivly are added.

As such, these files shouldn't live under /etc but under /var/db... and
they should be generated on package install instead of through funky
sed magic in the Makefile.

So now they are. :)

Oh and regen the PLIST, since, we're hacking the crap out of it anyway.
