@Compton is a lightweight, standalone composite manager, suitable for use
with window managers that do not natively provide compositing functionality.

Compton itself is a fork of xcompmgr-dana, in turn a fork of xcompmgr.

Compton in particular is notable for fixing numerous bugs found in
its predecessors, and as such, is popular due to its reliability and
stability. Numerous additional improvements and configuration options
have also been implemented, including a faster GLX (OpenGL) backend
(disabled by default), default inactive/active window opacity, window
frame transparency, window background blur, window color inversion,
painting rate throttling, VSync, condition-based fine-tune control,
configuration file reading, and D-Bus control.
