1.2
log
@update to 4.8.2
- since we no longer have GCC3_ARCHES, simplify, no way it's gonna compile
on a GCC2_ARCH anyways (size matters)
- so, we have only SHARED_ONLY arches, remove those frags as well.
- fold back qt4-sqlite since sqlite is part of core now.

of main qt tools way (like assistant on top of qtconfig)
