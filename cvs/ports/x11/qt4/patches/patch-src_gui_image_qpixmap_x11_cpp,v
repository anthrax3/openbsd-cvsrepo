@Partially revert fix for CVE-2013-0254 which does not work with our
privilege-separated X and caused broken displays for applications using
qt frames, diff from dcoppa, okay espie.

(An alternative fix would be to disable shm support, i.e.
"CONFIGURE_ARGS += -no-mitshm", I'd prefer this but it would need further
testing).
