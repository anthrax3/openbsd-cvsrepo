Subject: [PATCH] Fix drawing of 0-width polylines from outside the devicerect.

This was broken by a previous fix which aimed to fix gaps in
polylines with tiny line segments. The result was that we
skipped updating the origin point when stroke() didn't produce
pixels which accidentally included the case of the line
being completely outside the deviceRect. I fixed this
by returning the value of clipLine in drawLine to the caller
so we could still update the origin for this case.

Task-number: QTBUG-31579
Change-Id: Iac29436f042da7658bbeaf9370351dc6f2c95065
