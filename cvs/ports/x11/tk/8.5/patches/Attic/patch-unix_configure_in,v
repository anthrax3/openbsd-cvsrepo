@Change tclConfig.sh to set TCL_SRC_DIR as the directory holding
the installed headers, rather than the port build directory.

Remove configure.in patch ; obsoleted by a similar change to
tclConfig.sh in lang/tcl/8.5

Highlights of Tk 8.5

    * New modern theming engine: New and complementary widgets
      that make use of platform-specific theming on Mac OS X and
      Windows to better fit in with those environments, and
      feature an improved look and feel under X11.
    * New widgets: Part of the themed widget set, Tk now has
      core notebook, combobox, treeview and progressbar widgets.
    * text widget: Smooth scrolling, widget peering, and
      improved procedures for counting and replacing text.
    * Font rendering: Now uses anti-aliased text under X11, and
      a more modern text engine (ATSUI) on Mac OS X.
    * Additional improvements: Window transparency, new
      fullscreen option for windows, enhancements to specific
      widgets and window layout, and more.
