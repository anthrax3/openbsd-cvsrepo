@Tk is a graphical user interface toolkit that takes developing desktop
applications to a higher level than conventional approaches. Tk is the
standard GUI not only for Tcl, but for many other dynamic languages, and
can produce rich, native applications that run unchanged across most
platforms.

@import tk 8.5

Highlights of Tk 8.5

    * New modern theming engine: New and complementary widgets
      that make use of platform-specific theming on Mac OS X and
      Windows to better fit in with those environments, and
      feature an improved look and feel under X11.
    * New widgets: Part of the themed widget set, Tk now has
      core notebook, combobox, treeview and progressbar widgets.
    * text widget: Smooth scrolling, widget peering, and
      improved procedures for counting and replacing text.
    * Font rendering: Now uses anti-aliased text under X11, and
      a more modern text engine (ATSUI) on Mac OS X.
    * Additional improvements: Window transparency, new
      fullscreen option for windows, enhancements to specific
      widgets and window layout, and more.
