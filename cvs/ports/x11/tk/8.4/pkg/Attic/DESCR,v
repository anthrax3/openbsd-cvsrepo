@Tk is a graphical user interface toolkit that takes developing desktop
applications to a higher level than conventional approaches. Tk is the
standard GUI not only for Tcl, but for many other dynamic languages, and
can produce rich, native applications that run unchanged across most
platforms.

Tcl/Tk resources:
  Newsgroup: comp.lang.tcl
  Wiki: http://wiki.tcl.tk
  Book: Practical Programming in Tcl and Tk, 4th Edition

The best way to get started with Tcl and Tk is to read ``Tcl and the Tk
Toolkit, 4th ed'' by John K. Ousterhout, Addison-Wesley, ISBN 0-13-038560-3.

A full set of manual pages is also provided with this package.
