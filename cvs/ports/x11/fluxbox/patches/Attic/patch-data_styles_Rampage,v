@update to fluxbox-0.9.14; ok niallo@@ anriot@@ long ago and tested by many others

I had resisted this update until now thinking incorrectly that the vendor
would release a new version.  The background color was broken in all the
included styles and was clearly not tested.  So 4 months later here I am
patching 25 files instead. Sigh.

As a plus however, fluxbox no longer conflicts with blackbox.
