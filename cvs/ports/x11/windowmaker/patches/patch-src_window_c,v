commit 65802d3402dec0cfc995ec5cd1d50078fd35c183

wmaker: Use window placement settings on other workspaces.

Previously, if a window was placed on a workspace other than the current one,
the window placement settings (given by WindowPlacement) were ignored and
the window was drawn in the upper left hand corner.
