@Split wxWidgets into -main,-media.
wxWidgets-media is the wxMediaCtrl class for wxWidgets, which depends
on gstreamer.

@wxWidgets gives you a single, easy-to-use API for writing GUI
applications on multiple platforms. Link with the appropriate library
for your platform (Windows/Unix/Mac, others coming shortly) and compiler
(almost any popular C++ compiler), and your application will adopt the
look and feel appropriate to that platform. On top of great GUI
functionality, wxWidgets gives you: online help, network programming,
streams, clipboard and drag and drop, multithreading, image loading and
saving in a variety of popular formats, database support, HTML viewing
and printing, and much much more.

This package contains the GTK2 version of the library.
