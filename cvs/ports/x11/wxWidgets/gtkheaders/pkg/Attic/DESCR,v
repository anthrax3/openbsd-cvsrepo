@Update to 2.6.3; now there is only one version -- gtk2
@
text
@wxWidgets gives you a single, easy-to-use API for writing GUI
applications on multiple platforms. Link with the appropriate library
for your platform (Windows/Unix/Mac, others coming shortly) and compiler
(almost any popular C++ compiler), and your application will adopt the
look and feel appropriate to that platform. On top of great GUI
functionality, wxWidgets gives you: online help, network programming,
streams, clipboard and drag and drop, multithreading, image loading and
saving in a variety of popular formats, database support, HTML viewing
and printing, and much much more.

This package contains the GTK headers for the library.

@finally fix that mess: simply create a gtkheaders package holding the
common files, and change the gtk2 package name so that it no longer
looks like a flavor of gtk.

Do not forget to add the relevant conflict lines so that updates won't crash.
