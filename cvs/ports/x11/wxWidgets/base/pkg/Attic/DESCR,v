@Update to 2.6.3; now there is only one version -- gtk2

@wxWidgets gives you a single, easy-to-use API for writing GUI
applications on multiple platforms. Link with the appropriate library
for your platform (Windows/Unix/Mac, others coming shortly) and compiler
(almost any popular C++ compiler), and your application will adopt the
look and feel appropriate to that platform. On top of great GUI
functionality, wxWidgets gives you: online help, network programming,
streams, clipboard and drag and drop, multithreading, image loading and
saving in a variety of popular formats, database support, HTML viewing
and printing, and much much more.

This package contains the 'base' version of the library.
This includes only the utility classes, without any GUI classes.
