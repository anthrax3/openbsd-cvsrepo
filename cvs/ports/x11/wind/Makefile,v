Wind is a window manager for the X Window System. It supports virtual
desktops, optional Xft font rendering, and is pretty standards compliant.
It provides overlapping window management with click-to-type focus.

Unlike most window managers, Wind does not have the concept of minimized
or hidden windows. Instead of hiding and unhiding windows, the virtual
desktops abstraction makes it easy to group similar tasks and switch between
these groups instantly using convenient key bindings.

Standards compliancy is a prominent goal of the project, and Wind supports
almost all mandatory parts of the ICCCM and the Extended Window Manager
Hints specifications.
