@remove playfair, as the distfile is no longer publicly available and
apple changed something, so playfair can't decrypt new purchases from
the itunes music store anyway.  there's supposedly another project that
can and it has a different name, so say goodbye.

@import playfair-0.5.0:

The playfair program is quite simple.  It takes one of the iTMS
Protected AAC Audio Files, decodes it using a key obtained from your
iPod or Microsoft Windows system and then writes the new, decoded
version to disk as a regular AAC Audio File.  It then optionally copies
the metadata tags that describe the song, including the cover art, to
the new file.
