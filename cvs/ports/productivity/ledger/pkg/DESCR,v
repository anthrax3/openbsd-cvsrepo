@Ledger is a powerful, double-entry accounting system that is accessed
from the UNIX command-line. This may put off some users - as there is no
flashy UI - but for those who want unparalleled reporting access to
their data, there really is no alternative.

Ledger never creates or modifies your data. Your entries are kept in a
text file that you maintain, and you can rest assured, no automated tool
will ever change that data.

Ledger is 100% currency-agnostic. You can store multiple currencies in
any account, convert between them, or even pay in one currency and
receive change in another.

Ledger is international. Although UTF8 support is not quite there yet,
Ledger uses ISO format dates, attaches no meaning to the naming of
accounts, and can accept data in either US or European decimal formats.
It will report currencies back to you following the manner of your own
entries.

Ledger uses a simple set of base commands which can be extended in
countless ways. You can create monthly reports, average reports, check
account balances, reconcile accounts, keep track of capital gains on
stocks, etc.

Ledger is an accounting tool with the moxie to exist. It provides no
bells or whistles, and returns the user to the days before user
interfaces were even a twinkling in their father's CRT. What it does
offer is a double-entry accounting ledger with all the flexibility and
muscle of its modern day cousins, without any of the fat. Think of it as
the Bran Muffin of accounting tools.
