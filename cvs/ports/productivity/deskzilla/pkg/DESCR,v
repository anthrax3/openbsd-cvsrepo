@Deskzilla is a desktop client for Bugzilla bug tracking system. Its
unique features and interactive interface save your time and facilitate
issue tracking process.
This is the Lite editition which is a fully-functional Deskzilla that
requires no license key, and it has a couple of limitations:
* Only a single connection to Bugzilla server is supported.
* works only if you have 1,000 or less bugs in Bugzilla for those
products you work with.

Additionally, Deskzilla Lite allows unlimited connections to well-known
Bugzilla servers that host open-source projects.

@Import deskzilla-lite 2.1:

Deskzilla is a java desktop client for Bugzilla bug tracking system.
This is the Lite editition which is a fully-functional Deskzilla that
requires no license key, but has a couple of limitations:
* Only a single connection to Bugzilla server is supported.
* works only if you have 1,000 or less bugs in Bugzilla for those
products you work with.
Additionally, Deskzilla Lite allows unlimited connections to well-known
Bugzilla servers that host open-source projects (mozilla, apache, gnome,
kde, xfce....).

Setting permit markers to 'Free version of commercial product', awaiting
licence clarification/permission to distribute from upstream.
