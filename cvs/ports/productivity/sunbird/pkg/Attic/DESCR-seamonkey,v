@Remove -lighting subpackages, they can be built from their respective
host applications using --enable-calendar, so it makes more sense to
move the subpackages there, as seamonkey and thunderbird can get out of
synch.. now sunbird is only a standalone app.
Convert to mozilla MODULE while here, greatly shrinks Makefile. Use
EPOCH for seamless upgrades, as previous PKGNAME contained 1.0b1 which
wasn't detected as 1.0beta1.

@Lightning is a calendar/task management extension for Mozilla
Seamonkey, and supports local and remote calendars through CalDav
, WebDAV or WCAP protocols, and subscription to iCal/.ics invitations.

@Update to sunbird/lightning 1.0b1, the calendar and task management
suite from Mozilla.
http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/calendar/2010/04/sunbird_10_beta1_now_available.html
Note that development of standalone sunbird is stopped due to lack of
manpower, and efforts will port on lightning addon for
thunderbird/seamonkey from now on.
Update also largely based on www/firefox35 port, added a -seamonkey
subpackage to allow users to get lighting inside seamonkey suite.
