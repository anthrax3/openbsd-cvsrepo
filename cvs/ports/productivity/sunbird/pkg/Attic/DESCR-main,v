@Remove -lighting subpackages, they can be built from their respective
host applications using --enable-calendar, so it makes more sense to
move the subpackages there, as seamonkey and thunderbird can get out of
synch.. now sunbird is only a standalone app.
Convert to mozilla MODULE while here, greatly shrinks Makefile. Use
EPOCH for seamless upgrades, as previous PKGNAME contained 1.0b1 which
wasn't detected as 1.0beta1.

@Import Mozilla Sunbird/Lightning 0.9:
Mozilla Sunbird is a full blown enterprise ready calendar and task
management application, using Mozilla XUL framework. It supports local
and remote calendar using CalDAV or WCAP protocols, and subscription
to iCal/.ics invitations.
Lightning provides the calendar/task management extension for Mozilla
Thunderbird.
Port heavily based on mail/mozilla-thunderbird.
