@Remove devel/xulrunner/1.9, www/fennec, www/firefox36 and productivity/sunbird

- nothing uses xulrunner 1.9 anymore, and that branch was EOL'd upstream
  20 months ago (firefox36 was already unlinked from the build)
- www/fennec as a xul app is dead upstream, since now firefox mobile is
  built on top of java android libs and thus unportable to regular OS.
The esr10 branch from which it was built upon was EOL'd upstream 10 months ago
- productivity/sunbird as a standalone app is dead upstream since 3
  years, hypothetical users should just use thunderbird+lightning which
is still supported/developed.

No complains from ports@@, this will allow for a serious mozilla ports
cleanup, and we're down to 5 mozillas in the ports tree.

@Mozilla Sunbird is a full blown enterprise ready calendar and task
management application, using Mozilla XUL framework. It supports local
and remote calendar, using CalDAV or WCAP protocols, and subscription
to iCal/.ics invitations.

@Remove -lighting subpackages, they can be built from their respective
host applications using --enable-calendar, so it makes more sense to
move the subpackages there, as seamonkey and thunderbird can get out of
synch.. now sunbird is only a standalone app.
Convert to mozilla MODULE while here, greatly shrinks Makefile. Use
EPOCH for seamless upgrades, as previous PKGNAME contained 1.0b1 which
wasn't detected as 1.0beta1.
