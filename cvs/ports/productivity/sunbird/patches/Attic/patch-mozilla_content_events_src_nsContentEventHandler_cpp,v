@Remove devel/xulrunner/1.9, www/fennec, www/firefox36 and productivity/sunbird

- nothing uses xulrunner 1.9 anymore, and that branch was EOL'd upstream
  20 months ago (firefox36 was already unlinked from the build)
- www/fennec as a xul app is dead upstream, since now firefox mobile is
  built on top of java android libs and thus unportable to regular OS.
The esr10 branch from which it was built upon was EOL'd upstream 10 months ago
- productivity/sunbird as a standalone app is dead upstream since 3
  years, hypothetical users should just use thunderbird+lightning which
is still supported/developed.

No complains from ports@@, this will allow for a serious mozilla ports
cleanup, and we're down to 5 mozillas in the ports tree.

@Readd patches/files from mail/mozilla-thunderbird, atm sunbird can't be
built from newer thunderbird tarballs (as it's officially
unmaintained/dead upstream) and this gets in the way of thunderbird 5
update. Hopefully i'll figure out how to fix that... bump REVISION to be
on the safe side.
