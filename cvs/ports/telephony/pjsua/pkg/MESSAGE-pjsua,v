1.1
log
@Update and rework the telephony/pjsua port. The upstream distribution
is a telephony library (pjsip) with some sample applications; pjsua
itself is one of those samples. Previously the port built everything
but only installed the application; newer versions of Asterisk require
the libraries, so I've converted to multi-packages, providing a new
pjsip package with the libs, and retaining pjsua as a separate package
providing the CLI SIP client.

Taking maintainership with the agreement of chrisz@@.
