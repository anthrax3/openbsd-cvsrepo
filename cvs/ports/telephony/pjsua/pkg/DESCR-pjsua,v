1.1
log
@Update and rework the telephony/pjsua port. The upstream distribution
is a telephony library (pjsip) with some sample applications; pjsua
itself is one of those samples. Previously the port built everything
but only installed the application; newer versions of Asterisk require
the libraries, so I've converted to multi-packages, providing a new
pjsip package with the libs, and retaining pjsua as a separate package
providing the CLI SIP client.

Taking maintainership with the agreement of chrisz@@.

the reference implementation for PJSIP and PJMEDIA. It has many
features, such as:

      to 254 sources can be mixed to a single destination)
    * Call features: call hold, call transfer (attended or unattended,
      with or without refersub).
    * SIP Presence/SIMPLE with PIDF and XPIDF support. PUBLISH support.
    * Instant messaging and message composing indication
    * DTMF digits transmission/receipt (RFC 2833)
    * WAV file playing, streaming, and recording.
    * Accoustic echo cancellation (AEC).
    * Auto-answer, auto-play file, auto-loop RTP
    * Support SIP UDP, TCP, and TLS transports. Support for DNS SRV
      resolution.
    * NAT traversal with rport and STUN.
