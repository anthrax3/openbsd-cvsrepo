@Fix sample cdr.conf in Asterisk (s/enabled/enable/ - the former used to be
valid but is no more). From Todd Mortimer.

Standardise style while there.

@SECURITY update to 1.8.2.4 fixes AST-2011-002 buffer overflow
Workaround: add "t38pt_udptl = no" to the general section in sip.conf
(chan_ooh323 is also affected but we don't build that).

1.1.2.1
log
@Merge Asterisk from current to -stable (mostly; we still have to
use autoconf 2.64 as 2.65 needs newer m4 than 4.9-release has).
Too many important fixes to cherrypick them, including the security
fixes below, plus some others which aren't directly security-related.

AST-2011-007 (CVE-2011-2216): Null pointer deref in SIP if
malformed Contact headers are present. Remote crash can be triggered
by anyone who can send you a SIP call.

AST-2011-006: shell access via remote authenticated manager
sessions (logged-in manager users can execute shell commands via
the manager interface without having the "system" privilege that
should be required)

AST-2011-005: DoS with remote unauthenticated sessions (add limits
to prevent unauthenticated users from tying up all available FDs for
the manager interface, SIP-over-TCP, Skinny and the built in HTTP
server).

AST-2011-003 and AST-2011-004: unchecked return codes (fdopen, fwrite)
causing null pointer deref / resource exhaustion.

AST-2011-002: buffer overflow.
