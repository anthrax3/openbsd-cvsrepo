@Major version update to 1.6.0.19. For more information about the
upgrade, see /usr/local/share/doc/asterisk/UPGRADE-1.6.txt

Particular thanks to fgsch@@, ian@@ and Michiel van Baak for help and testing.

; Music on Hold -- Sample Configuration

; There are various ways to handle musiconhold. The lightweight method
; is to use Asterisk's internal transcoding to play files from a directory.
; The drawback here is that playback starts from the start of the file,
; so regular callers might hear them often.
;
; This supports any of the usual codecs used on calls (e.g. alaw, gsm);
; they can be pre-converted to save transcoding during calls. 8KHz mono
; RIFF .wav files are also supported (convert with sox).

[default]
mode=files
directory=${LOCALBASE}/share/asterisk/moh
random=yes

; The method used in earlier versions is to have one external process
; running all the time, which feeds MOH for all calls. Using mp3 files,
; here's an example, take your pick of application.

;[mp3]
;mode=custom
;format=SLIN
;application=/usr/local/bin/mpg123 -q -r 8000 -f 8192 -s --mono
; -or-
;application=/usr/local/bin/madplay -Q -z -o raw:- --mono -R 8000 -a -12 -
;directory=/usr/local/share/asterisk/moh-mp3

; Streaming from the network (or another source) is possible too,
; it shouldn't be necessary but it seems helpful to create a directory
; containing an empty file e.g.
;
; # cd /usr/local/share/asterisk && mkdir moh-empty && touch moh-empty/0.mp3

;[mp3stream]
;mode=custom
;format=SLIN
;directory=/usr/local/share/asterisk/moh-empty
;application=/usr/local/bin/mpg123 -q -r 8000 -f 8192 -s --mono http://example:8014/

@SECURITY:
Update to 1.2.9.1 which addresses a security vulnerability in the IAX2
channel driver (chan_iax2). The vulnerability affects all users with
IAX2 clients that might be compromised or used by a malicious user, and
can lead to denial of service attacks and random Asterisk server crashes
via a relatively trivial exploit.

; This plays files directly from the specified directory, no external
; processes are required. Files are played in normal sorting order
; (same as a sorted directory listing), and no volume or other
; sound adjustments are available. If the file is available in
; the same format as the channel's codec, then it will be played
; without transcoding (same as Playback would do in the dialplan).
; Files can be present in as many formats as you wish, and the
; 'best' format will be chosen at playback time.
;
; NOTE:
; If you are not using "autoload" in modules.conf, then you
; must ensure that the format modules for any formats you wish
; to use are loaded _before_ res_musiconhold. If you do not do
; this, res_musiconhold will skip the files it is not able to
; understand when it loads.
;
; format_mp3 is in the asterisk-addons package;
; format_wav supports 8KHz mono RIFF .wav files.
