1.3
log
@Update the asterisk port to 10.8.0 - This is a major update, notable changes:

- If using ConfBridge, note that the dialplan arguments have changed.

- If using the built-in HTTP server, note that a bindaddr must now be given,
previously the default was 0.0.0.0 but this must now be given explicitly.

- Internal database now uses SQLite3 not BDB, conversion tools are provided.

See share/doc/asterisk/UPGRADE.txt for more.

| Running ${FULLPKGNAME} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Configuration
=============
Simplified sample configuration files have been provided
in ${SYSCONFDIR}/asterisk; the full set from the Asterisk distribution
is available in ${PREFIX}/share/examples/asterisk/default; some or all
of these can be copied to ${SYSCONFDIR}/asterisk and edited.

Asterisk logs to /var/log/asterisk/messages by default; log rotation
can be handled by adding a line like the following to /etc/newsyslog.conf:

/var/log/asterisk/messages		640  5     1000 *     Z "asterisk -rx 'logger reload'"


Documentation
=============
${PREFIX}/share/doc/asterisk/AST.pdf is probably the single best
resource for the current version.

1.2.2.1
log
@Merge Asterisk from current to -stable (mostly; we still have to
use autoconf 2.64 as 2.65 needs newer m4 than 4.9-release has).
Too many important fixes to cherrypick them, including the security
fixes below, plus some others which aren't directly security-related.

AST-2011-007 (CVE-2011-2216): Null pointer deref in SIP if
malformed Contact headers are present. Remote crash can be triggered
by anyone who can send you a SIP call.

AST-2011-006: shell access via remote authenticated manager
sessions (logged-in manager users can execute shell commands via
the manager interface without having the "system" privilege that
should be required)

AST-2011-005: DoS with remote unauthenticated sessions (add limits
to prevent unauthenticated users from tying up all available FDs for
the manager interface, SIP-over-TCP, Skinny and the built in HTTP
server).

AST-2011-003 and AST-2011-004: unchecked return codes (fdopen, fwrite)
causing null pointer deref / resource exhaustion.

AST-2011-002: buffer overflow.

@SECURITY update to 1.8.2.4 fixes AST-2011-002 buffer overflow
Workaround: add "t38pt_udptl = no" to the general section in sip.conf
(chan_ooh323 is also affected but we don't build that).
