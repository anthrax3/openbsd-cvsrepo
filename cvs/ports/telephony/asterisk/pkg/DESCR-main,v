@tweaks to the asterisk port; currently no effective change to the packages.

- remove unused non-working patches and framework for chan_h323;
this driver is deprecated upstream anyway.

- add patches to let the alternative chan_ooh323 addon module build.
currently unused in the port, 'make configure; cd $WRKSRC; gmake menuselect'
and enable it there if you want to play.

- sync unistim patch.

- mention the IMAP flavour in DESCR (and thus bump REVISION-main).

@Asterisk is a complete IP PBX in software. It provides all of the
features you would expect from a PBX including many advanced features
that are often associated with high end (and high cost) proprietary
PBXs, such as Voicemail services with Directory, Call Conferencing,
Interactive Voice Response, and Call Queuing.

Asterisk supports Voice over IP in many protocols, and can
interoperate with almost all standards-based telephony equipment
using relatively inexpensive hardware.

Flavours:

	IMAP - use imap for voicemail storage instead of files.

@- Build Asterisk with sRTP support.
- Remove DESCR parts and PFRAG relating to currently-disabled H.323 support.

log
@MFC update to asterisk 1.8.11.0, relative to previous version this
includes fixes for various crash/deadlock problems and the following
SECURITY problems:

AST-2012-002: stack buffer overflow (remote unauthenticated sessions).
requires a dialplan using the Milliwatt application with the 'o' option,
and internal_timing off.  Affects all 1.4+ Asterisk versions.

AST-2012-003: stack buffer overflow (remote unauth'd sessions) in HTTP
manager interface; triggered by long digest authentication strings.
Code injection possibility.  Affects 1.8+.
