@SECURITY update to asterisk 1.8.2.1, fixes AST-2011-001 "an issue
when forming an outgoing SIP request while in pedantic mode, which
can cause a stack buffer to be made to overflow if supplied with
carefully crafted caller ID information"

http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/security/AST-2011-001.html

This is also a major version update to the long-term support
1.8 branch, previous versions of this diff have been tested by
various ports@@ readers, thanks for testing.

Please review /usr/local/share/doc/asterisk/UPGRADE.txt
(also note that memory use has increased).

@- SECURITY update to 1.6.0.25, fixing AST-2010-003. if you use ACL rules
with something like 'deny 0.0.0.0/0' then this affects you. workaround:
'deny 0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0'

- fix fullpkgpath's for the subpackages, they were including the flavour
and shouldn't have - fixes problems with dpb3 found by naddy. add @@pkgpath
markers relating to this fix.
