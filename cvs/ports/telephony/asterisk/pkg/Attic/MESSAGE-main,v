@SECURITY update to 1.8.2.4 fixes AST-2011-002 buffer overflow
Workaround: add "t38pt_udptl = no" to the general section in sip.conf
(chan_ooh323 is also affected but we don't build that).

1.6.2.1
log
@Merge Asterisk from current to -stable (mostly; we still have to
use autoconf 2.64 as 2.65 needs newer m4 than 4.9-release has).
Too many important fixes to cherrypick them, including the security
fixes below, plus some others which aren't directly security-related.

AST-2011-007 (CVE-2011-2216): Null pointer deref in SIP if
malformed Contact headers are present. Remote crash can be triggered
by anyone who can send you a SIP call.

AST-2011-006: shell access via remote authenticated manager
sessions (logged-in manager users can execute shell commands via
the manager interface without having the "system" privilege that
should be required)

AST-2011-005: DoS with remote unauthenticated sessions (add limits
to prevent unauthenticated users from tying up all available FDs for
the manager interface, SIP-over-TCP, Skinny and the built in HTTP
server).

AST-2011-003 and AST-2011-004: unchecked return codes (fdopen, fwrite)
causing null pointer deref / resource exhaustion.

AST-2011-002: buffer overflow.

@update to 1.6.0.26 + a patch from a ticket upstream.

To have Asterisk start at boot time, you may insert the following
into /etc/rc.local:

if [ -x ${PREFIX}/sbin/safe_asterisk ]; then
        echo -n ' asterisk';   ${PREFIX}/sbin/safe_asterisk
fi

@maintenance update to 1.4.24

@a9 7

This uses safe_asterisk which monitors for abnormal termination
and restarts the daemon, and also creates the directory for the
control socket and pid file (by default, /var/run/asterisk).

If you prefer not to use safe_asterisk, you must create this
directory yourself since /var/run is cleared at boot.

Upgrading users, please note that some incompatible changes have occurred
since 1.2 (mainly removal of deprecated commands, but some defaults have
changed, and DTMF has been heavily overhauled); the following files have
more information:
