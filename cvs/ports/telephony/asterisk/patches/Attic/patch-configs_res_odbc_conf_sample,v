1.1
log
@Update the asterisk port to 10.8.0 - This is a major update, notable changes:

- If using ConfBridge, note that the dialplan arguments have changed.

- If using the built-in HTTP server, note that a bindaddr must now be given,
previously the default was 0.0.0.0 but this must now be given explicitly.

- Internal database now uses SQLite3 not BDB, conversion tools are provided.

See share/doc/asterisk/UPGRADE.txt for more.
