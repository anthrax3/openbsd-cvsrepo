@rm appkonference, suggested a while ago by dhill; the built-in conferencing
in recent Asterisk works fine on OpenBSD, whereas appkonference  is somewhat
fragile, not well-maintained upstream, and only works with i386/amd64.

@Fix appkonference with Asterisk 10.x; from dhill.

Note: this port may be removed in the future; users are recommended to
migrate to ConfBridge, which is part of Asterisk itself and has improved
greatly in the rewrite for Asterisk 10.x.
