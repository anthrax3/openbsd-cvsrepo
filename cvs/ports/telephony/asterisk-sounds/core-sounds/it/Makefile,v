1.1
log
@update to newer Asterisk sound files, adding:

(core)
- Italian language prompts for core sounds
- missing prompts for VoiceMailMain application in Russian

(extra)
- various fixed files in extra-sounds
- various new files in extra-sounds (some in French, many in English)
- many files duplicated from core-sounds have been removed
- note: "an-error-has-occured" has been renamed "an-error-has-occurred"

Additionally the packages now install the text files detailing changes
and a text description of the font files (renamed to avoid conflicts
between flavours).

sln16 versions have been dropped from packages for now to save a
few hundred MB per arch on the mirrors, g729 versions have been added
in their place.
