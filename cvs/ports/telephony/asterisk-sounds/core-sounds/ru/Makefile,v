@revamp asterisk sound-file packaging.

- strip core-sounds and moh out of the main asterisk package,
they change comparatively rarely.

- provide all available languages.

- provide multiple codecs for all files, replacing the asterisk-native-sounds
package which only provided ulaw versions of the asterisk 1.4 files, ports
laid out to permit parallel building.

- the old asterisk-sounds package providing additional sound files beyond
the core ones is now "extra-sounds" modelled after the filename of the
distributed files.
