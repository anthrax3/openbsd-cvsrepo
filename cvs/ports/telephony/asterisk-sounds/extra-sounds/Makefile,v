@Update to the 1.5 versions of asterisk-core-sounds and asterisk-extra-sounds
where available. core-sounds for a couple of languages aren't there yet so
distinfo files and infra have been rearranged to cope.

1.2
log
@update to newer Asterisk sound files, adding:

(core)
- Italian language prompts for core sounds
- missing prompts for VoiceMailMain application in Russian

(extra)
- various fixed files in extra-sounds
- various new files in extra-sounds (some in French, many in English)
- many files duplicated from core-sounds have been removed
- note: "an-error-has-occured" has been renamed "an-error-has-occurred"

Additionally the packages now install the text files detailing changes
and a text description of the font files (renamed to avoid conflicts
between flavours).

sln16 versions have been dropped from packages for now to save a
few hundred MB per arch on the mirrors, g729 versions have been added
in their place.

1.1
log
@revamp asterisk sound-file packaging.

- strip core-sounds and moh out of the main asterisk package,
they change comparatively rarely.

- provide all available languages.

- provide multiple codecs for all files, replacing the asterisk-native-sounds
package which only provided ulaw versions of the asterisk 1.4 files, ports
laid out to permit parallel building.

- the old asterisk-sounds package providing additional sound files beyond
the core ones is now "extra-sounds" modelled after the filename of the
distributed files.
