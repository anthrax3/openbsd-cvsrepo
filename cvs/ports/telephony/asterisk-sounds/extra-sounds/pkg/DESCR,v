@revamp asterisk sound-file packaging.

- strip core-sounds and moh out of the main asterisk package,
they change comparatively rarely.

- provide all available languages.

- provide multiple codecs for all files, replacing the asterisk-native-sounds
package which only provided ulaw versions of the asterisk 1.4 files, ports
laid out to permit parallel building.

- the old asterisk-sounds package providing additional sound files beyond
the core ones is now "extra-sounds" modelled after the filename of the
distributed files.

text
@This package contains an assortment of useful and not so useful
${MODAS_LANGNAME} sound files for Asterisk in ${MODAS_CODEC} format.

Codecs currently available via FLAVORs are as follows:

gsm:	GSM compression. Small files, but low quality. "Asterisk default".
wav:	RIFF WAV files. 8KHz.
ulaw:	ITU G.711 mu-law. Common in countries using T1 lines
	(N.America and Japan).
alaw:	ITU G.711 A-law. Common in most other countries.
g722:	ITU G.722. Wide-band codec.
sln16:	Signed Linear 16 KHz. Not normally used natively, but providing
	CPU is sufficient to transcode this avoids loss in quality.
