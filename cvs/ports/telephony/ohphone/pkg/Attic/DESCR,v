@Ohphone is a fully functional H.323 endpoint command line application
that can be used to listen for incoming H.323 calls, or to initiate a
call to a remote host.  It includes a simple menu that allows
interactive control of functions, as well as allowing control of most
dialing and answer functions via a phone handset.
