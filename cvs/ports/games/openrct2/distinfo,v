@Import games/openrct2, an open source re-implementation of RollerCoaster
Tycoon 2.
ok bentley@@

OpenRCT2 is an open source re-implementation of RollerCoaster Tycoon 2  
and the original RollerCoaster Tycoon, construction and management      
simulation games that simulate amusement park management. You can also  
build your own roller coasters.     

OpenRCT2 requires game files from RollerCoaster Tycoon 2 in order to    
work properly. It will also use files from the original RollerCoaster   
Tycoon if available.
