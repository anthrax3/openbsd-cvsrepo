@FreeDroid Classic is a clone of the game "Paradroid" which was released
on Commodore 64 in 1985.
In this game, you control a robot located within an interstellar
spaceship consisting of several decks connected by elevators.
The aim of the game is to destroy all enemy robots by either shooting
them or seizing control over them by creating connections in a short
subgame of electric circuits.
The graphics are designed to be a fairly faithful reproduction of the
original game.
