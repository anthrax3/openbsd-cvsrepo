@X11 block dropping game in 3 dimensions.

The grand father of this game is Tetris, its father is Blockout on
PC/DOS.  The player must place 3D pieces by translations and rotations
in order to fill the game floor.  The game is realtime and the speed
increases with the player skill.

XBL is a 3D block-dropping game.

XBL is an interactive game under X11 (color or black&white) and UN*X.

XBL is a good training tool to understand 3D rotations and 3D vision.
    You need reflex and memory (human).

XBL implements 6 different ways to perform animation under X11!
    (more or less good)
 
- The game world is a 3D discrete space.
- The player has a top view of this discrete space.
- The game throws blocks made of cubes (one to five cubes).
- A block falls inside the discrete space, and stops when hitting the 
floor or another block.
- If a discrete space level is full, it is destroyed.
- Another block appears (only one moving block at a time).
- Player can move or rotate blocks (perfect real time if you have a fast
host).
The goal is to play as long as possible.

XBL home is : "ftp://ftp710.univ-lyon1.fr/pub/xbl"
XBL URL  is : "http://www710.univ-lyon1.fr/ftp/xbl/xbl.html"

Good luck!
