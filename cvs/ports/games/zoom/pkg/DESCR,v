@Zoom is a Z-Machine, which means that it plays text adventure games
written in ZCode.  The original games were written by a company called
'Infocom' in the 80's: these are available on the Infocom Masterpieces
CD, published by Activision.  The version presented here is known to
work with version 3, 5, 7 and 8 story files. Version 4 should be ready
soon, but version 6 will take a bit more work.  It is designed to run
under the X Window System.
