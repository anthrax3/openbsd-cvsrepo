@Import games/corsixth, an open source clone of Theme Hospital.
ok awolk@@, with feedback and help from sthen@@

CorsixTH is a reimplementation of the 1997 Bullfrog business sim Theme
Hospital. As well as faithfully recreating the original, CorsixTH adds
support for modern operating systems, high resolutions, and much more.

CorsixTH requires game assets from Theme Hospital to work properly.
