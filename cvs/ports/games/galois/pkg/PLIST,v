@Patch out the Help Browser. It requires yelp, which requires webkit.
There are more archs that can run galois than have webkit, so seems silly
to needlessly deny those archs the ability to run galois.

@Import games/galois

Galois is a computer game of the "falling blocks" type, but with unique
features. Unlike most other games of that type, Galois is not limited to
blocks made of four two-dimensional square bricks: you can choose among
several different brick shapes, blocks composed of more or less bricks,
and even between two- and three-dimensional games.
