@Xye is a puzzle game in which the objective is to help a character that
looks like a green circle to get all the gems in the room. This is, of
course, not as easy as it sounds. Xye must solve all sorts of puzzles
while at the same time avoiding all sorts of traps and beasts. Xye is
similar to other puzzle games like sokoban or boulderdash, yet it also
includes some arcade elements.
