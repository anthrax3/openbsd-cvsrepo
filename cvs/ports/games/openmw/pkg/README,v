| Running ${FULLPKGNAME} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

You must legally own and install Morrowind before you can use OpenMW as
it is intended - to play Morrowind. OpenMW is a reimplementation of the
technical aspects of the game only. It does not come with any "content"
- namely the art, game data, and other copyrighted material that you
need to play the game as designed by Bethesda Softworks. You have to
provide this content yourself by installing Morrowind and then
configuring OpenMW to use the existing installation.

Mount the original CD if you have it or, if you have an ISO image, read
vnconfig(8) for instructions to mount it.  After you have mounted either
disk or its image you need to run openmw-wizard and point it to the
correct path.
