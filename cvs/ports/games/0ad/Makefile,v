@Import 0ad-0.0.16.

0 A.D. (pronounced "zero ey-dee") is a free, open-source, cross-platform
real-time strategy game of ancient warfare. In short, it is a
historically-based war/economy game that allows players to relive or
rewrite the history of Western civilizations, focusing on the years
between 500 B.C. and 500 A.D. The project is highly ambitious, involving
state-of-the-art 3D graphics, detailed artwork, sound, and a flexible
and powerful custom-built game engine.
