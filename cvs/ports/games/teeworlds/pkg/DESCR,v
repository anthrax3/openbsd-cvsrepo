@from new maintainer Donovan Watteau:
"- update from 0.5.2 to 0.6.3, which fixes a lot of security issues and
  which makes the game playable online again.
- don't bother building on strict-alignment archs.  On loongson, both
  the client and the server SIGBUS during startup, and looking at the
  code it seems that it will crash on anything not x86 or ppc.
- don't include an extra copy of DejaVuSans.ttf.
- use audio/wavpack, not an internal copy.
- make sure an internal zlib is never used.
- invoke "bam" with -a, to make sure that it will abort on error.
- don't enforce stack protector, base gcc(1) enables it wherever
  it's possible.
- fix endianness detection (confirmed to work on macppc).
- drop patch-src_engine_client_ec_snd_c.  At first, I ported it to
  teeworlds-0.6.2, but actually this patch makes audio much worse
  for me, and I can't observe anymore the crash it was supposed
  to fix."
