@Import ufoai-2.3.1.

"UFO: Alien Invasion" is a squad-based tactical strategy game in the
tradition of the old X-COM PC games, but with a twist. This game
combines military realism with hard science-fiction and the weirdness
of an alien invasion. The carefully constructed turn-based system gives
you pin-point control of your squad while maintaining a sense of pace
and danger.
