log
@Hedgewars is a turn based strategy, artillery, action and comedy
game, featuring the antics of pink hedgehogs with attitude as they
battle from the depths of hell to the depths of space.

As commander, it's your job to assemble your crack team of hedgehog
soldiers and bring the war to your enemy.
