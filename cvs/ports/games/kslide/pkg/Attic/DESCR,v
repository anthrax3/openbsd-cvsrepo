@KSlide is a simple puzzle game compatible with the K Desktop
Environment.  The playing principle of KSlide is very simple. From
a square set of tiles, one is removed, allowing at least two adjacent
tiles to be shifted.  This way, the puzzle is scrambled by the
program, and the player's goal is to restore the original order.

@Update KSlide to latest version, 1.0.1. Previous version did not work
anyway (at least on i386). MAINTAINER timeout => removing him.

Minor tweaks to port's Makefile while there: WANTLIB, license etc.
