@update to Abuse 0.8 from maintainer Antti Harri
@
text
@Abuse is a dark 2D side-scrolling platform game developed by Crack dot
Com in 1995. It features beautiful lighting, realistic animation and
nasty alien-like creatures to destroy.  Abuse-sdl is based on Crack.com's
public domain release of Abuse.

Original sound effects or music files have not been included due to
copyright issues. Instead a collection of free sound effects has
been included.

Crack.com public domain release of Abuse.
Abuse is an arcade quality game running in a colorful 320x200 screen.
Abuse needs a 8 bits visual, so you might need to reconfigure your X server.

Here's the plot :

"Falsely accused and imprisoned in a high-security facility, you watch in
horror as a mysterious biogenetic experiment turns everybody around you --
guards and prisoners alike, into ravening, inhuman monsters.  Your only
hope -- steal a suit of powered armor, any weapons you can get your hands
on, and make your way to the deepest level of the prison, before the
plague spreads to the outside world."

You need to, at this time, download and extract the dos shareware
version for the config/lisp/sound/map files from
ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/abuse/abuse200.zip.
