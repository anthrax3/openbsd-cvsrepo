@Import cutemaze 1.1.0, a really simple maze game for kids.
(modeled after other gottcode games)

CuteMaze is a simple, top-down game in which mazes are randomly
generated using one of a choice of several different algorithms. You
move the character through the maze while hunting for targets (cheese,
by default)-the game is won once all of these targets have been picked
up.
