@Widelands is an economic and military simulation game.  The map is shown
in parallel perspective with 3-dimensional terrain.  Buildings and units
are animated.  The player controls a tribe.  Land is claimed and held by
military presence and then used to build an economy to support military
expansion and confrontation.  The project is a work in progress where
much remains to be done; computer players and multiplayer are in very
early stages of development.  Some features that have already been
implemented are exploration, fog of war, sound effects, background
music, adjustable simulation speed, a few tutorial campaigns,
translations to several languages, and a map editor.
