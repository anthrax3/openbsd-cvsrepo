@Ren'Py is a free and cross platform engine for digital storytelling. It
makes it easy to combine words, images, and sounds to create visual
novels and life simulation games.

Visual novels are computer-based stories that are told through words,
images, sounds, and music. Many visual novels also present the player
with menu choices that allow the player to control how the story is
told.

Ren'Py's script language makes it easy to write visual novels, and other
writing-heavy games. It's easy to learn, and scales well to the largest
projects. Even without customization, Ren'Py provides the features
players have come to expect from their visual novels.

Life Simulation games, such as management and dating sims, are more
interactive games that mix story with gameplay. Ren'Py's screen language
allows one to create complex interfaces, while its support for the
Python scripting language makes allows for complex game logic, if that's
what your project requires.
