1.3
log
@Update to uqm-0.7.0.

Addons structure and behavior has changed in this release:
 - 3domusic and remix addons can, when installed, be selected from the game
   settings menu rather than as command-line arguments
 - voice addon will be automatically enabled when installed, but can be
   turned off by adjusting the voice volume in the game settings menu
