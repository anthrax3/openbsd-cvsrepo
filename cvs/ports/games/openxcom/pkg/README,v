| Running ${FULLPKGNAME} on OpenBSD

In order to play the game you need original data from
"UFO: Enemy Unknown" / "X-Com: UFO Defense".
For a system wide installation you can copy them to:
    ${PREFIX}/share/openxcom/data/

For a user specific installation you can copy them under:
    ~/.local/share/openxcom/data/

For a user specific installation you can copy them to your home:

Once data has been set up you can execute 'openxcom'.

You can also make a user specific installation like this:
    $ mkdir ~/ufoxcom
    $ cp -r ${PREFIX}/share/openxcom ~/ufoxcom
d15 1
a15 2
Now you need to put the original data under ~/ufoxcom/DATA and to run
the game, execute 'openxcom-bin' under ~/ufoxcom.

log
@Import openxcom-20110404.

OpenXcom is an open-source reimplementation of the popular
"UFO: Enemy Unknown" ("X-Com: UFO Defense" in USA) videogame by
Microprose.

It requires the original data sets from one of these games.
