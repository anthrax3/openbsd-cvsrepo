1.1
log
@- Don't try to close joysticks that have never been opened (and do not
  even exist, although reported as existing by SDL).
  From Antti Harri <iku@@openbsd.fi>.

- Don't pass -1 to a function expecting an unsigned int (ugly quick-fix
  by adding a cast; I'll suggest upstream to fix this in a better way).

- Fix an sizeof (char *) error.

The latter two fix the build on arm.
