@Imagine you are skiing down an infinite slope, facing such hazards as
trees, ice, bare ground, and the man-eating Yeti!  Unfortunately, you
have put your jet-powered skis on backwards, so you can't see ahead
where you are going; only behind where you have been.  However, you can
turn to either side, jump or hop through the air, teleport through
hyperspace, launch nuclear ICBMs, and cast spells to call the Fire
Demon.  And since the hazards occur in patches, you can skillfully
outmaneuver them.  A fun and very silly game that proves you don't need
fancy graphical user interfaces to have a good time.

This is a Python reimplementation of a C game from 1990, with on-line
help added.  The original was by Mark Stevans, this implementation is
released under open-source terms by Eric S. Raymond.

The internals of this game are actually kind of interesting.  The
terrain generator is a simple cellular automaton that generates crude 2D
fractals.
