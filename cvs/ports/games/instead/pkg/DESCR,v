@INSTEAD was designed to interpret games that are a mix of visual novels,
text adventure games and classical 90's quests.

- high portable
- easy game development (Lua for game scripts)
- oldschool

Some existing games can be downloaded from the homepage; this includes
puzzles and various others, not just adventure games.
