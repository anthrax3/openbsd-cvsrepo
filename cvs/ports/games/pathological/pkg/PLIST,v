@import of pathological-1.1.3, from Xavier Santolaria:

Pathological is an enriched clone of the game "Logical" by Rainbow Arts.
To solve a level, fill each wheel with four marbles of matching color.
Various board elements such as teleporters, switches, filters, etc. make
the game interesting and challenging.
