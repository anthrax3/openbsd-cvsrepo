@update to chocolate doom 2.0.0
adds support for hexen, heretic and strife

joint work with rfreeman@@ who had a similiar update
earlier version ok kirby@@
@
text
@To play the game you will need an original Doom, Ultimate Doom,
Doom II, Final Doom, Heretic, Hexen, or Strife IWAD. Place the
doom.wad, doom2.wad, plutonia.wad, tnt.wad, heretic.wad, hexen.wad,
strife1.wad + voices.wad or all of the above in
${PREFIX}/share/doom/ to play.  The shareware will also work.

If multiple IWADs are installed, you may specify the one you want to
play via the -iwad command-line parameter e.g.

  $ chocolate-doom -iwad doom.wad
  $ chocolate-heretic -iwad heretic1.wad (heretic shareware)

The Doom Shareware IWAD is available in the doomdata package.

Run `chocolate-gamename-setup' to generate a configuration file to your
liking.

@Define game data directory via MAKE_FLAGS and perl subst, no more patches.
games data directory now ${PREFIX}/share/doom, to fit with where other
game ports put their data.  Also, fix check for python during configure.

OK sthen@@ and phessler@@

If you would like to enjoy the classic in-game Doom music, you may
install audio/timidity and Chocolate Doom will automatically make use
of it at runtime, no recompilation required. Be sure that the music is
enabled within chocolate-setup.

1.1.1.1
log
@Chocolate Doom is a portable branch of the classic doom.exe experience
from the days of DOS. The author, Simon Howard, has worked to insure 
Chocolate Doom, which is nothing more than a directly modified version
of the released iD Software source code, has zero changes that affect
gameplay, look, or feel, and also re-created a DOS-like setup program to
configure the game much like the original setup.exe.
