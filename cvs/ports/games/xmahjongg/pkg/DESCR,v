@Real Mah Jongg is a social game that originated in China thousands
of years ago. Four players, named after the four winds, take tiles
from a wall in turn. The best tiles are made of ivory and wood;
they click pleasantly when you knock them together.

The object is to remove all Mah Jongg tiles from the playing field
by taking one matching pair at a time. Generally, two tiles match
if they have identical pictures on top. There are some exceptions:
any season tile (spring, summer, autumn, or winter) matches any
other season, and any flower tile (bamboo, orchid, plum, or
chrysanthemum) matches any other flower. There are 144 tiles in all
-- one of each season and flower, and four copies of each of the
following: 1 to 9 dots; 1 to 9 bamboo sticks; characters for 1 to
9; the four winds (north, south, east, and west); and three dragons
(red, green, and white).

Mah jongg is an ancient chinese game usually played by four players
with tiles similar to dominos.  This is an X windows version for
the solitaire game originally seen on the PC and later ported to
SunView.  It also has a new tournament option.

THEORY OF PLAY
The object of the game is to remove all the tiles from the board.
Tiles are removed in by matching two identical tiles which have
either an open left edge or open right edge.  The only exception
to this rule is that any open "flower" tile (bamboo, orchid, plum,
or chrysanthemum) matches any other open "flower" tile and any open
"season" tile (spring, summer, autumn, or winter) matches any other
open "season" tile.
