@filter pointer events by /16, so that the game cursor is not redrawn
needlessly each time the mouse moves by one pixel.

Makes the game playable for me.

@- Build from a recent snapshot of the repository at git.zerfleddert.de
  instead of the tarball from laptop.org.  Lets us get rid of many
  patches.

- Enable shared memory (run without -w) since kurt@@'s patch has fixed
  it.

This gives us many bugfixes and goodies such as a fix for the numlock
freeze bug and re-enabling the air crash disaster.  Full changelog at
