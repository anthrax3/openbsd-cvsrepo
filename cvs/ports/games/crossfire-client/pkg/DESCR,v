adventure game. Since its initial release, Crossfire has grown to
encompass over 150 monsters, about 3000 maps to explore, an elaborate

Crossfire is a multi-player graphical arcade and adventure game made 
for the X11 Window system environment. It has certain flavours from 
other games, especially gauntlet and the rogue-like games (Nethack, 
Moria, Angband, and Ragnarok.) Any number of players can move around 
in their own window, finding and using items and battling monsters. 
They can choose to cooperate or compete in the same world.
