@Update wesnoth to the latest release 1.10.1.

General difference (for ports infrastructure):
 - switch to cmake build system
 - drop external lua and use internal patched version
 - set SEPARATE_BUILD=flavored to avoid extracting a lot of data for every arch
 - removed superfluous dependency to devel/sdl
 - drop tinygui FLAVOR

Full changelog is here:
http://svn.gna.org/viewcvs/*checkout*/wesnoth/tags/1.10.0/changelog

OKs from jasper@@ (maintainer), aja@@, pascal@@, cmake-wise OK from dcoppa@@
Positive feedback from Antti Harri and Bryan Linton via ports@@

@the tinygui special casing for zaurus didnt work.  even if it did, it's
not desirable because then a package compiled on cats would be different
but the MACHINE_ARCH would be the same and that's not what we want.  so
make a tingyui flavor instead.
