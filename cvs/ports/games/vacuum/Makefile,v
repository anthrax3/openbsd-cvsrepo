@Import vacuum-0.13a

Vacuum Magic is a fast-paced sidescrolling shoot-em-up. The point of the
game is using your magical vacuum field to collect food and defend
against monsters. Food and certain monsters can also be spat out and
used as a projectile against other monsters.

Vacuum Magic can be played by up to six players, either cooperatively
or against each other.
