@Castle-Combat is a clone of the arcade classic, Rampart. This version 
currently supports 2 to 4 players on local or remote servers. Players
build castle walls, place cannons inside these walls, and shoot at the 
walls of their enemy(s). If a player can't build a complete wall around 
one of his castles, he loses. The last surviving player wins.
