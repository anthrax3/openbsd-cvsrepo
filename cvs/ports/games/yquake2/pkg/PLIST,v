@games/yquake2 6.00 => 7.01

OK abieber@@

Port changes:
 - bump version
 - install new ref_gl1 / ref_gl3 shared libraries into
   /usr/local/lib/yquake2
 - patch the Makefile to not pass -Wl,--no-undefined to
   the linker, change already merged upstream:
     https://github.com/yquake2/yquake2/pull/213
 - patch backends/generic/vid.c to dlopen libraries
   from /usr/local/lib/yquake2 instead of relying
   on Sys_GetBinaryDir() that thinks the OS can tell
   it the executable path

Regarding the .so changes, please see the following 2 github links
 - https://github.com/yquake2/yquake2/pull/213
 - https://github.com/yquake2/yquake2/issues/214
especially the second one. In short, it's possible that upstream will
add a way to define /usr/local/lib/yquake2 as a compile time option
which would make this patch obsolete. Note that I did not move the game.so
file on purpose, as upstream mentioned in 213 that mods expect it to be
in that specific spot.

If you want to test the new renderer just execute the game with:
 $ quake2 +vid_renderer gl3

after first run it will be added to your config, or you can add it
yourself by adding:

 set vid_renderer "gl3"

to:

/home/mulander/.yq2/baseq2/config.cfg

Upstream changelog:

Quake II 7.00 to 7.01:
- Fix build of GL3 for platforms without SSE.
- Fix Jennel Jaquays name in credits and quit screen.
- Make Quake II high DPI aware on Window Vista and above.
- Fix some problems with loading dependend librarys on Windows.

Quake II 6.00 to 7.00:
- Remove the broken multitexturing render path from the OpenGL 1.4
  renderer. It was switched off by default in 6.00.
- Reimplement the support for shared renderer libraries. Please note
  the this is an incompatible implementation with an custom API. The
  original renderer libraries will not work!
- Implement an OpenGL 3.2 renderer. This renderer has the same look
  and feel as the old OpenGL 1.4 renderer but makes heavy use of
  modern OpenGL and GPU features. An OpenGL 3.2 capable GPU (Intel
  starting with Ivy Bridge on Windows or Sandy Bridge on Linux, Nvidia
  staring with G80 and AMD starting with R600 / HD2000) is required.
- Fix OpenAL compatibility with modern openal-soft versions.
- Several fixes and optimizations to OpenAL, implement support for
  doppler effects. (by xorw)

@Update games/yquake2 5.32 => 5.34

OK abieber@@

Changes in the port:
 - taking MAINTAINER, agreed with bmercer@@ who provided the initial port
 - added a q2ded rc script in a similar fashion as the games/ioquake3
   port does
 - the existing /usr/local/share/yquake2/q2ded binary from previous
   port did not work as it was searching for games.so from a relative
   path. I found a way to make both quake2 and q2ded work with an
   upstream supported MAKE variable to provide the system wide quake
   data directory. Thanks to this change we can drop the wrapper script
   and use the binaries directly.
 - adding a new _yquake2 user/group plus /var/yquake2 for the dedicated server
   binary
 - updated the port to version 5.34

Additional notes:
 - make port-lib-depends-check complains on:
   Extra:  openal.2 pthread.22

   ktrace tells me that the check is wrong. Openal and pthreads are both
   used.
 - upstream said in their changelog that they are changing their
   platform policy 'Switch from an arch whitelist to an "all archs are
   supported" approach.'. I saw in our tree a change by landry@@
   specifically limiting the supported platform to the upstream
   supported versions
   (http://cvsweb.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/ports/games/yquake2/Makefile?rev=1.2&content-type=text/x-cvsweb-markup).
   I am not removing this restriction until I get some feedback from
   people able to test other platforms than currently
   listed in ONLY_FOR_ARCHS.

Upstream changelog:

Quake II 5.33 to 5.34:
- Add support for stereo 3D (by Valery Guskov)
- Make gibt solid so they move with conveyor belts.
- Disable gl_ext_multitexturing by default.
- Switch from an arch whitelist to an "all archs are supported"
  approach.
- Add a new README.

Quake II 5.32 to 5.33:
- Add OGG volume slider in settings menu
- Fixed some bugs in volume settings
- Replaced HUD scale option in video menu with generic UI scale
- General UI upscaling improvements
- Better support for keyboards with AZERTY layout
