Submitted by Peter Stromberg <home@@wilfried.net>.

WMeyes is a pretty simple application: it sits in the
WindowMaker dock, and a pair of eyes track your cursor.
Actually, the program should work in all window managers,
but then you don't have a dock to sit it in, in which case
you might as well use xeyes.
