@Remove dead cruft that's one of the few ports keeping x11/gnome/libs
and other old gtk1 stuff alive.

nobody even tried to convince me to keep this;
bomberclone or xbomber may be a good alternative though.

@Bombermaze is Bomberman clone for GNOME. It is a multiplayer action game
in which players run around in a square-grid maze while dropping bombs
and collecting power-ups. The bombs explode after a short time delay,
taking out any nearby bricks and players. For maximum effect, bombs
can be arranged so as to cause a chain reaction of explosions.
The last player left is the winner.
