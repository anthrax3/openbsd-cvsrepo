@M.A.R.S. is a ridiculous 2D space shooter with awesome visual effects
and attractive physics. Players can battle each other or computer
controlled enemies in exciting game modes.

In the year 3547, civilizations all over the galaxy have settled their
own planets, living in peace and harmony. But outside their
contemplative habitats, the GREAT WAR is raging. As a famous fighter on
your way to never ending honor and prosperity, you must protect your
planet from the oncoming doom of your jealous neighbors!
