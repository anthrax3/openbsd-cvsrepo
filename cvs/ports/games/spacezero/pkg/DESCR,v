@SpaceZero is a Real Time Strategy 2D space combat game with very minimal
hardware requirements. The objective is to conquer the universe,
defeating all other players.

You can play single player against computer players, up to 7 computer
players. Multiplayer is currently limited to only two players playing
over a network.

All ships can be controlled by the computer (automatic mode) or by the
player (manual mode). You can easily change the control mode of your
ships, controlling all of them independently.
