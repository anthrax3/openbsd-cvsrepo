@Remove the games/quake port

The port was superseded by games/quakespasm

OK abieber@@
@

@Quake is a 3D action game, which can be played both single-user as multi-
user. This package holds binaries for Quake, QuakeWorld.

Note that you must have quake datafiles from elsewhere.

System wide data directory  : ${PREFIX}/share/quakeforge
Per-user game data directory: ~/.quakeforge

One of those directories should contain the following:

./id1/
./id1/pak0.pak
./id1/pak1.pak
./id1/config.cfg

You can optionally also have the following:

./rogue/
./rogue/pak0.pak
./rogue/config.cfg
./hipnotic/
./hipnotic/pak0.pak

Refer to ${HOMEPAGE}doxygen/ for documentation and
command line switches.

@- enable on sparc64
- use official distfile and set EPOCH
- sort WANTLIB and depends a little
- builds now with bsd make
- switch to ipv4 networking, leave ipv6 disabled -> ipv4 works out of the box
- remove asm optimization bits, got it to build but it crashes the client
- mention upstream's nice docs
- some fixes that went straight to upstream

Quake has some audio bugs that cause stuttering. If you experience any
stuttering you should try without sndiod or make sndiod block size larger (-b).
Note that the bigger the sndiod block size is, the bigger the latency becomes
between video and audio.

Note that you must have quake datafiles from elsewhere. The directory
in which you launch quake should contain the following:
a22 5

Flavors:
	sdl	uses sdl library, allows full screen.
	ggi	uses ggi library, somewhat theoretical interest.
	gl	uses gl library, OpenGL accelerated.

@- add a gl flavor
* seems to have issues still on amd64 though.

based on a diff by oga@@, tweaked by me.
