@switch to new MULTI_PACKAGES

@Quake is a 3D action game, which can be played both single-user as multi-
user. This package holds binaries for Quake, QuakeWorld.

Note that you must have quake datafiles from elsewhere.

Flavors:
	sdl	uses sdl library, allows full screen.
	ggi	uses ggi library, somewhat theoretical interest.

@Quake. Needs you to have datafiles to be useful.

Original by Maurices Nonnekes, a few tweaks (sound, i386 optimizations,
longer save menus) by me.

The client/server part probably still needs some work... 
and it is definitely unaudited.

Packaging might be changed to account for docs...

In fact, I really need `common' package files and reference counting...
