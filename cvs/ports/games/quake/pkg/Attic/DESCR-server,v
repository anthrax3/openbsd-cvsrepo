@Remove the games/quake port

The port was superseded by games/quakespasm

@Quake is a 3D action game, which can be played both single-user as multi-
user. This package holds server binaries.

Note that you must have quake datafiles from elsewhere.

System wide data directory  : ${PREFIX}/share/quakeforge
Per-user game data directory: ~/.quakeforge

One of those directories should contain the following:

./id1/
./id1/pak0.pak
./id1/pak1.pak
./id1/config.cfg

You can optionally also have the following:

./rogue/
./rogue/pak0.pak
./rogue/config.cfg
./hipnotic/
./hipnotic/pak0.pak

Refer to ${HOMEPAGE}doxygen/ for documentation and
command line switches.

@- enable on sparc64
- use official distfile and set EPOCH
- sort WANTLIB and depends a little
- builds now with bsd make
- switch to ipv4 networking, leave ipv6 disabled -> ipv4 works out of the box
- remove asm optimization bits, got it to build but it crashes the client
- mention upstream's nice docs
- some fixes that went straight to upstream

Quake has some audio bugs that cause stuttering. If you experience any
stuttering you should try without sndiod or make sndiod block size larger (-b).
Note that the bigger the sndiod block size is, the bigger the latency becomes
between video and audio.

@Quake. Needs you to have datafiles to be useful.

Original by Maurices Nonnekes, a few tweaks (sound, i386 optimizations,
longer save menus) by me.

The client/server part probably still needs some work... 
and it is definitely unaudited.

Packaging might be changed to account for docs...

In fact, I really need `common' package files and reference counting...
