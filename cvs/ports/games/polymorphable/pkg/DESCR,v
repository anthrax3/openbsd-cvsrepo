@Originally created for the 2012 Liberated Pixel Cup, this game is based
upon Clint Bellanger's FLARE engine. Our goal is to create a game which
draws upon several different classics in the genre, with a heavy
emphasis on polymorphable main character.

Laurelia's Polymorphable Citizen (or just Polymorphable for short) is an
action-rpg based on the FLARE engine. We're aiming a little more towards
an 8-bit adventure classic feel, only with more RPG aspects (ie.
attribute choices on level up!)

The core mechanic in Polymorphable is using different talismans to
polymorph into different forms so you can reach different areas. Imagine
being blocked by a pit, so you transform into a bat to fly across. Or
perhaps there's a wall of fire in front of you, so you turn into ghost
form to phase right through.

To play, launch FLARE. Go to the Mods tab in the Configuration menu and
make sure polymorphable is the only Active Mod listed (only entry in
the right hand menu).
