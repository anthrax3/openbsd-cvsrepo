@Shareware Duke Nukem 3D data has been installed to: 
  ${PREFIX}/share/duke3d/

You may also copy your registered version data files (or any other
Duke Nukem 3D retail copies, such as the Atomic Edition) to a local
directory such as ~/duke3d/, and run eduke32 from within that directory:

  % cd ~/duke3d/ && eduke32

This will load your registered version data rather than the installed
shareware.

eduke32 includes a map editor, mapster32, which is an up-to-date
version of Ken Silverman's BUILD editor, including changes necessary
to impliment the advanced mapping/modding functions of eduke32.

Sample maps, defs and con files can be used to show how to create your
own maps and modifications, if you are so inclined. They are located in
${PREFIX}/share/examples/eduke32/

Licenses are found under ${PREFIX}/share/doc/eduke32/

http://wiki.eduke32.com/ contains a large resource of information on
how to make full use of the eduke32 engine and mapster32 editor.

@Import eduke32.

eduke32 is an advanced Duke Nukem 3D engine capable of playing
the game, and filled to the brim with editing enhancements.
Includes mapster32, a map-making program similar to the original
build map editor.
