@Source-port of the venerable Duke Nukem 3D, also usable as a homebrew
game engine. Besides increasing portability, the engine adds new
renderers, in-game configurability, console, plus extended editing and
scripting capabilities. Networking for dukematches and coop play is
fully functional. 

The engine supports the following games:
(from http://wiki.eduke32.com/wiki/Frequently_Asked_Questions)
* Duke Nukem 3D Shareware Version
* Duke Nukem 3D
* Duke Nukem 3D: Atomic Edition
* NAM (Note: you must rename GAME.CON from NAM to NAM.CON)
* Napalm (Wal-Mart only version of NAM, some .GRP differences between 
  the two releases)
* WWII GI (Limited Support using NAM mode as a base)
