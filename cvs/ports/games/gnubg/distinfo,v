log
@GNU Backgammon (gnubg) plays and analyzes backgammon games and matches. It is
able to play and analyze both money games and tournament matches, evaluate and
roll out positions, and more. Driven by a command-line interface, it displays
an ASCII rendering of a board on text-only terminals, but also allows the user
to play games and manipulate positions with a graphical GTK+ interface. GNU
Backgammon is extensible via Python.

GNU Backgammon is a world class opponent and rates at around 2200 on FIBS, the
First Internet Backgammon Server - at its best, it is in the top 5 of over
6000 rated players there). GNU Backgammon can be played on numerous other
on-line backgammon servers.
