@Import lugaru-1.1.

Lugaru (pronounced Loo-GAH-roo) is a cross-platform third-person action
game. The main character, Turner, is an anthropomorphic rebel bunny rabbit
with impressive combat skills. In his quest to find those responsible for
slaughtering his village, he uncovers a far-reaching conspiracy involving
the corrupt leaders of the rabbit republic and the starving wolves from a
nearby den. Turner takes it upon himself to fight against their plot and
save his fellow rabbits from slavery.
