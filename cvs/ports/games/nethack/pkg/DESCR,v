@Move fontpath from /usr/local/lib/X11/fonts to /usr/local/share/fonts to match
XDG_DATA_DIR (where Desktop tools will look for by default).

@This is nethack.  Will you dare explore the dungeon, kill creepy monsters,
and finish the game ?   At least, you're starting with a bonus: a puppy
(or a kitten) to help you.

If you find that game too easy, you may want to try slash instead.

To use nethack with X11 graphics, you will also have to add 
${PREFIX}/share/fonts/hack to your fontpath, see xset(1) and 
Xserver(1).

The tty version with colors uses ANSI colors, unless it finds a suitable
termcap entry, for instance xterm-color. 

Flavors:
no_x11
	runs without X11.
qt
	qt2 interface

P.S. This is a very addictive game, with its whole wacky culture. And even
   a newsgroup dedicated to it (rec.games.roguelike.nethack). Don't say we
   didn't warn you !

@Revamped nethack port:

- 3.3.0.
- fixed packaging.
- moved common data to hackdata port, to avoid nasty collision with slash.
- compile and install recover.
- only install manpages that correspond to stuff we run.
- remove need for GMAKE.
- include configuration files, allow for X11/plain/qt flavor
(qt is not yet ready, it needs qt 2.0).

Colors work much better, even under console if TERM is set to pcvt25.
