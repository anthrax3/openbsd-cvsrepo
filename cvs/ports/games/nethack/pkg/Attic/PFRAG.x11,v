1.1
log
@Revamped nethack port:

- 3.3.0.
- fixed packaging.
- moved common data to hackdata port, to avoid nasty collision with slash.
- compile and install recover.
- only install manpages that correspond to stuff we run.
- remove need for GMAKE.
- include configuration files, allow for X11/plain/qt flavor
(qt is not yet ready, it needs qt 2.0).

Colors work much better, even under console if TERM is set to pcvt25.
