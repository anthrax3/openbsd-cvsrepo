@Fix games/tome4 problems

spoted by ajacoutot & fcambus

 - MODGCC_ARCHS changed to MODGCC4_ARCHS
 - MODGCC_LANGS removed as language 'c' is the default
   so setting this variable is not needed here
 - Updated patch-premake4_lua to use variable substitution
   instead of hard-coded paths
 - Added share/tome4/ and share/tome4/game/ to PLIST-data
   and remove it from PLIST-main. Without it removing tome4
   would error out informing about non empty directories
 - Simplified the RUN_DEPENDS-main line, the way it was
   done previously prevented REVISION bumps from working
 - bumped REVISION of both packages to 0
