@import games/naev, from Kirill Bychkov, ok ajacoutot@@

Naev is a 2D space trading and combat game, taking inspiration from the
Escape Velocity series, among others.

You pilot a space ship from a top-down perspective, and are more or less
free to do what you want. As the genre name implies, you're able to
trade and engage in combat at will. Beyond that, there's an ever-growing
number of storyline missions, equipment, and ships; Even the galaxy
itself grows larger with each release. For the literarily-inclined,
there are large amounts of lore accompanying everything from planets to
equipment.
