@In 2000, Raven Software released the source code to their class based
shooter game Hexen II and its multiplayer extension HexenWorld. Since
then, there has been some source ports of this game, such as the now
discontinued Anvil of Thyrion project, but nothing has been done for
Linux since the beginning of 2002.

The Hammer of Thyrion project is a cross-platform source port effort: We
continue the development for Linux, BSD and Mac OS X people, with
continued support for Windows users as well. Many bugs are fixed and
even new features are added: New sound modes, improved mouse handling,
improved video modes, OpenGL glows and more. You can go to our project
page for more information.
