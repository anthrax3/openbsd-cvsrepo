@Import mysticmine-1.2.0.

Guide your gold car through a mine, switching rails with a single button.
You can only go down, but thanks to an optic illusion in the levels, you can
always reach every point. Play this game alone or invite some friends and
play against each other. The game supports up to 6 people on one keyboard.
Everyone can enjoy this family friendly game, regardless of age or
experience.
