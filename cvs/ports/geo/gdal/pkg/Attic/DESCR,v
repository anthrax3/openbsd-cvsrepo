@Update to GDAL/OGR 1.6.0 :
- enable python bindings and utilities
- split package into -main and -python
- enable support for WMS/WFS through curl
- enable geos support
- enable postgis support through postgresql-client
(all this is needed by bigger incoming GIS ports)
looks good to pval@@ (maintainer)

@GDAL is a translator library for raster geospatial data formats that is
released under an X/MIT style Open Source license by the Open Source
Geospatial Foundation. As a library, it presents a single abstract data
model to the calling application for all supported formats. It also
comes with a variety of useful commandline utilities for data
translation and processing.
