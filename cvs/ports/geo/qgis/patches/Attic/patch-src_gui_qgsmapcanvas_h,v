@Long awaited update to QGIS 2.4.0.

Since 1.8, QGIS requires bison > 2.4 at build time, but since noone
cares enough our bison is still stuck at 2.3. To workaround this,
add the parsers generated with a WIP bison 2.6.2 to files/, and comment
out the Cmake goo to call/detect bison.

Add patches from http://hub.qgis.org/issues/10762.

I've used QGIS 1.8, 2.0, 2.2 and 2.4 without issues since > 2 years.
