@Import spatialindex 1.8.0, needed by upcoming QGis 1.8.0.

The purpose of this library is to provide:
* An extensible framework that will support robust spatial indexing
  methods.
* Support for sophisticated spatial queries. Range, point location,
  nearest neighbor and k-nearest neighbor as well as parametric queries
  (defined by spatial constraints) should be easy to deploy and run.
* Easy to use interfaces for inserting, deleting and updating
  information.
* Wide variety of customization capabilities. Basic index and storage
  characteristics like the page size, node capacity, minimum fan-out,
  splitting algorithm, etc. should be easy to customize.
* Index persistence. Internal memory and external memory structures
  should be supported. Clustered and non-clustered indices should be
  easy to be persisted.
