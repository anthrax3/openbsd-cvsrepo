@GPSBabel converts waypoints, tracks, and routes from one format to another,
whether that format is a common mapping format like Delorme, Streets and Trips,
or even a serial upload or download to a GPS unit such as those from Garmin and
Magellan. By flattening the Tower of Babel that the authors of various programs
for manipulating GPS data have imposed upon us, it returns to us the ability to
freely move our own waypoint data between the programs and hardware we choose to
use.@
