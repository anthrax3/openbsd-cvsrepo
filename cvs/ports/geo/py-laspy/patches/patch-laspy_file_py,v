@Import py-laspy 1.5.0.

Laspy is a pythonic library for reading, modifying and writing LAS
files, ie point cloud data. Support for LAZ is limited to reading LAS
version 1.0-1.4 files. Laspy is compatible with Python 2.6+ and 3.5+.

Laspy includes a set of command line tools which can be used to do basic
file operations like format translation and validation as well as
comparing LAS files.
