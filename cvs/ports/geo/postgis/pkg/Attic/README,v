@Remove README explaining how to preload libpthread in postgresql, it
seems it's not needed anymore.

Postgis requires pthreads in order to work. OpenBSD does not allow
shared objects that link to pthreads to be opened via dlopen if the
executable program does not link to pthreads. So to use postgis, you
must ensure that libpthread is loaded before PostgreSQL.
The easiest way to do this is adding the following login class
to login.conf:

postgresql:\
	:setenv=LD_PRELOAD=libpthread.so:\
	:tc=daemon:

the PostgreSQL rc.d(8) script will take care of launching the daemon
with that login class.

log
@Unbreak by finally updating to postgis 2.0.1, working with postgres 9.2.

- add build dep on ImageMagick/docbook-xsl/libxslt to build the documentation
- dont install the utils anymore, they're not maintained and were barely
  useful. postgis_restore.pl is in share/postgresql/contrib/postgis-2.0 now
- provide a complete do-regress target taking care of creating/starting/tearing
  down a temporary database
- 'CREATE EXTENSION postgis' is now the simpler way to spatially-enabled a db
- add a README explaining how to LD_PRELOAD libpthread.so in postgresql since
  it's required by postgis
- take maintainership from eric@@ since he doesn't use it anymore
- see http://www.postgis.org/news/20120403/ for the list of new features
  in the 2.x branch.
