@Import tangogps 0.99.3, from maintainer Kirill Bychkov, thanks!

tangoGPS is an easy to use, fast and lightweight mapping application for
use with or without GPS.  It runs on any *nix platform from the desktop
over eeePC down to phones like the Openmoko Neo.  By default tangoGPS
uses map data from the Openstreetmap project. Additionally a variety of
other repositories can be easily added.  The maps are automagically
downloaded and cached for offline use while you drag or zoom the map.
Furthermore you can conveniently pre-cache areas with tangoGPS.
