@import foxtrotgps-1.1.1

FoxtrotGPS is an offshoot of Marcus Bauer's excellent Free & Open Source
tangoGPS application, with a focus on cooperation and fostering
community innovation. By default maps tiles are downloaded from the
Openstreetmap project. Map tiles are automatically downloaded and cached
for offline use. To get real-time positioning from a GPS receiver you
need to run gpsd.

With some help from jasper@@, input and ok@@ from dcoppa@@
