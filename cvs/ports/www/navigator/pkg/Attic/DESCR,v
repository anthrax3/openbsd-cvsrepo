@Netscape stand-alone Navigator 4.61, fortified
----------------------------------------------

Release notes for this version of Netscape are available on-line.  After
starting the program, select "Release Notes" from the "Help" menu.  This
will take you to the URL

    http://home.netscape.com/eng/mozilla/4.61/relnotes/unix-4.61.html

which lists new features and known problems of this release.

This version of Netscape has been modified for OpenBSD using Fortify,
a program that provides world-wide, unconditional, full strength
128-bit cryptography to export-crippled Netscape browsers.
