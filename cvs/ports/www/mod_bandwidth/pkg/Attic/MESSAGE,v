@Retire mod_bandwidth; unmaintained and there are alternatives.
Also this will be one less thing to take care of when we move away from
httpd(8).
no objection from espie@@ landry@@

@To finish the install of ${PKGNAME}, you need
to enable the module using the following command

  ${PREFIX}/sbin/${MODAPACHE_ENABLE}

If you already have Apache running on your machine,
you should not use "apachectl restart" - instead,
you should fully stop and then start the server.

Make sure you created the master/ and link/ directories before starting
the server.  Help is available in:
${PREFIX}/share/doc/mod_bandwidth/README.mod_bandwidth

For correct results, it is important that there aren't any "dead" links
in the "link" directory of mod_bandwidth when you start the server.
It may be a good idea to run the ${PREFIX}/sbin/cleanlink.pl daemon to
remove them automatically.

- tweak pkg/MESSAGE

- use the apache-module framework; work done by simon@@ (big thank to him)
