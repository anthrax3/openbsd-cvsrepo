1.2
log
@Update to NetSurf 3.1.

"NetSurf 3.1 contains many improvements over the previous release. The
highlights include much faster CSS selection performance, faster start
up time, new look and feel to the treeviews (hotlist/bookmarks, global
history and cookie manager), improved options handling, undo/redo
support in textareas, and general improvement of forms. Also included
are many other additions, optimisations and bug fixes. We recommend that
all users upgrade."

MNG support removed by upstream.
