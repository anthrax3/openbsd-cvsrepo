@LibNSFB is a framebuffer abstraction library, written in C. It is currently
in development for use with NetSurf and is intended to be suitable for use
in other projects too.

The overall idea of the library is to provide a generic abstraction to a
linear section of memory which corresponds to a visible array of pixel
elements on a display device. Different colour depths are supported and the
library provides routines for tasks such as drawing onto the framebuffer and
rectangle copy operations.
