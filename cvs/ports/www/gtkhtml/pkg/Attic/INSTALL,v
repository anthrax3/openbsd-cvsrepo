1.2
log
@Update to 1.1.7, a major update and API change.

This version is NOT compatable with the older 1.0 series but since the
one port that uses the 1.0 series will be updated shortly this isn't much
of an issue.

@Import GtkHTML 1.0.2:

GtkHTML is a lightweight HTML rendering/printing/editing engine.
It was originally based on KHTMLW, part of the KDE project, but is
now being developed independently.

Submitted by maintainer Marc Matteo <marcm@@lectroid.net>, with 
some fixes from me.
