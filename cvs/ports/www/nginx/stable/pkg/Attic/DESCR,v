@- remove the devel nginx packages
- apply chroot and other patches from the base system
- update to 1.7.4

@This is the stable branch of nginx, as distributed by nginx.org.  It provides
additional compiled-in modules over the version in the base system.

nginx provides FastCGI and reverse HTTP proxying, with or without caching,
including simple load balancing and fault tolerance.

It has a modular architecture.  Filters include gzipping, byte ranges,
chunked responses, and SSI.  Multiple SSI inclusions within a single page
can be processed in parallel if they are handled by FastCGI or proxied
servers.  SSL and TLS SNI are supported.

The mail proxy features user redirection to IMAP/POP3/SMTP backends
using an external HTTP authentication server, including SSL/STARTTLS
support and a range of authentication methods.

Available FLAVORs:

	lua - This Nginx module embeds the Lua 5.1 interpreter or LuaJIT 2.0
into the nginx core and integrates the powerful Lua threads (aka Lua
coroutines) into the nginx event model by means of nginx subrequests.

	passenger - Phusion Passenger(R) a.k.a. mod_rails or mod_rack makes
deployment of Ruby web applications, such as those built on the revolutionary
Ruby on Rails web framework, a breeze. It follows the usual Ruby on Rails
conventions, such as "Don't-Repeat-Yourself".

	naxsi - This Nginx module embeds Naxsi into nginx core. Naxsi is
a high performance, low rules maintenance, Web Application Firewall module.

1.1
log
@Update nginx stable in ports to 1.2.x and add devel (1.3.x), this is
separate from the version in the base OS which deliberately does not include
the mail proxy and additional modules. rc.d/enginx script is added (not
rc.d/nginx to avoid conflicting with base). Lua module is also supported.
Most of the work done by william@@, with a few tweaks by me and ok william.

README could use more work and as pointed out by ajacoutot we need to
review permissions of the tmp directory, but the diff is already long enough.
@@pkgpath markers are set to update from the 1.0.x packages to 1.2.x (with or
without the passenger flavour as appropriate).
