@Update nginx to use new dynamic modules feature

Switch all extrnal modules to be dynamic modules, and update them to use the
latest versions.  Use separate subpackages for all dynamic modules, so you
can easily choose which nginx features you want without rebuilding nginx
with a specific combination of FLAVORs.

Switch all internal modules that can be built dynamically to use dynamic
modules.

Start building the image_filter, geoip, perl, and xlst modules as dynamic
modules.

This requires changes to your nginx configuration if you were previously
using a FLAVORed version of nginx, or using the mail or stream features.

Log file rotation
=================
To use newsyslog to rotate the log files, you can replace the standard
entries for httpd(8) in /etc/newsyslog.conf with these:

/var/www/logs/access.log		644  4     *    $W0   Z /var/run/nginx.pid SIGUSR1
/var/www/logs/error.log			644  7     250  *     Z /var/run/nginx.pid SIGUSR1
