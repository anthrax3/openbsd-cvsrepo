@Update nginx to use new dynamic modules feature

Switch all extrnal modules to be dynamic modules, and update them to use the
latest versions.  Use separate subpackages for all dynamic modules, so you
can easily choose which nginx features you want without rebuilding nginx
with a specific combination of FLAVORs.

Switch all internal modules that can be built dynamically to use dynamic
modules.

Start building the image_filter, geoip, perl, and xlst modules as dynamic
modules.

This requires changes to your nginx configuration if you were previously
using a FLAVORed version of nginx, or using the mail or stream features.

@NAXSI means Nginx Anti XSS & SQL Injection.

The nginx nasxi module, by default, reads a small subset of simple (and
readable) rules containing 99% of known patterns involved in website
vulnerabilities. For example, <, | or drop are not supposed to be part of a URI.

Being very simple, those patterns may match legitimate queries, it is the
Naxsi's administrator duty to add specific rules that will whitelist legitimate
behaviours. The administrator can either add whitelists manually by analyzing
nginx's error log, or (recommended) start the project with an intensive
auto-learning phase that will automatically generate whitelisting rules
regarding a website's behaviour.

In short, Naxsi behaves like a DROP-by-default firewall, the only task is to add
required ACCEPT rules for the target website to work properly.
