@Update nginx to use new dynamic modules feature

Switch all extrnal modules to be dynamic modules, and update them to use the
latest versions.  Use separate subpackages for all dynamic modules, so you
can easily choose which nginx features you want without rebuilding nginx
with a specific combination of FLAVORs.

Switch all internal modules that can be built dynamically to use dynamic
modules.

Start building the image_filter, geoip, perl, and xlst modules as dynamic
modules.

This requires changes to your nginx configuration if you were previously
using a FLAVORed version of nginx, or using the mail or stream features.

@This is the stable branch of nginx, as distributed by nginx.org.

nginx provides FastCGI and reverse HTTP proxying, with or without caching,
including simple load balancing and fault tolerance.

It has a modular architecture.  Filters include gzipping, byte ranges,
chunked responses, and SSI.  Multiple SSI inclusions within a single page
can be processed in parallel if they are handled by FastCGI or proxied
servers.  SSL and TLS SNI are supported.
