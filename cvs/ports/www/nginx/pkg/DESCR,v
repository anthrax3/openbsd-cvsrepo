@committing on behalf of william@@ (co-MAINTAINER):

- fix pre-patch target to allow multiple FLAVORs (thanks ajacoutot@@ and phessler@@)

- add 'mailproxy' FLAVOR to enable mail_pop3_module, mail_imap_module,
  and mail_smtp_module (requested by Lyndon Nerenberg)

- sort the FLAVORs alphabetically in the README

ok ajacoutot@@ robert@@

@This is the stable branch of nginx, as distributed by nginx.org.

nginx provides FastCGI and reverse HTTP proxying, with or without caching,
including simple load balancing and fault tolerance.

It has a modular architecture.  Filters include gzipping, byte ranges,
chunked responses, and SSI.  Multiple SSI inclusions within a single page
can be processed in parallel if they are handled by FastCGI or proxied
servers.  SSL and TLS SNI are supported.

The mail proxy features user redirection to IMAP/POP3/SMTP backends
using an external HTTP authentication server, including SSL/STARTTLS
support and a range of authentication methods.

Available FLAVORs:

	lua - This Nginx module embeds the Lua 5.1 interpreter or LuaJIT 2.0
into the nginx core and integrates the powerful Lua threads (aka Lua
coroutines) into the nginx event model by means of nginx subrequests.

	mailproxy - enables the mail proxy features of nginx (specifically
the mail_pop3_module, the mail_imap_module, and the mail_smtp_module).

	naxsi - This Nginx module embeds Naxsi into nginx core. Naxsi is
a high performance, low rules maintenance, Web Application Firewall module.

	passenger - Phusion Passenger(R) a.k.a. mod_rails or mod_rack makes
deployment of Ruby web applications, such as those built on the revolutionary
Ruby on Rails web framework, a breeze. It follows the usual Ruby on Rails
conventions, such as "Don't-Repeat-Yourself".

This is the stable branch of nginx, as distributed by nginx.org.  It provides
additional compiled-in modules over the version in the base system.

1.4
log
@Update nginx stable in ports to 1.2.x and add devel (1.3.x), this is
separate from the version in the base OS which deliberately does not include
the mail proxy and additional modules. rc.d/enginx script is added (not
rc.d/nginx to avoid conflicting with base). Lua module is also supported.
Most of the work done by william@@, with a few tweaks by me and ok william.

README could use more work and as pointed out by ajacoutot we need to
review permissions of the tmp directory, but the diff is already long enough.
@@pkgpath markers are set to update from the 1.0.x packages to 1.2.x (with or
without the passenger flavour as appropriate).

    * Accelerated reverse proxying without caching, simple load balancing

    * Accelerated support without caching of remote FastCGI servers,

    * SSL and TLS SNI support.

Mail proxy server features:
    * User redirection to IMAP/POP3 backend using an external HTTP
      authentication server.
    * User authentication using an external HTTP authentication server
      and connection redirection to internal SMTP backend.
    * Authentication methods:
          o POP3: USER/PASS, APOP, AUTH LOGIN PLAIN CRAM-MD5
          o IMAP: LOGIN, AUTH LOGIN PLAIN CRAM-MD5
          o SMTP: AUTH LOGIN PLAIN CRAM-MD5
    * SSL support.
