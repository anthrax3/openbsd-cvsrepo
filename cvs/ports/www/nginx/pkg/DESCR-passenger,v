@Update nginx to use new dynamic modules feature

Switch all extrnal modules to be dynamic modules, and update them to use the
latest versions.  Use separate subpackages for all dynamic modules, so you
can easily choose which nginx features you want without rebuilding nginx
with a specific combination of FLAVORs.

Switch all internal modules that can be built dynamically to use dynamic
modules.

Start building the image_filter, geoip, perl, and xlst modules as dynamic
modules.

This requires changes to your nginx configuration if you were previously
using a FLAVORed version of nginx, or using the mail or stream features.

@This is the nginx module adding support for Phusion Passenger.

Phusion Passenger is a web server and application server, designed to be fast,
robust and lightweight. It takes a lot of complexity out of deploying web apps,
adds powerful enterprise-grade features that are useful in production, and makes
administration much easier and less complex. Phusion Passenger supports Ruby,
Python, Node.js and Meteor, and is being used by high-profile companies such as
Apple, Pixar, New York Times, AirBnB, Juniper etc as well as over 350.000
websites.

What makes it so fast and reliable is its C++ core, its zero-copy architecture,
its watchdog system and its hybrid evented, multi-threaded and multi-process
design.
