+-----------------------------------------------------------------------
| Running ${FULLPKGNAME} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

puppetboard has been installed into ${INSTDIR}

Please be aware that this is still experimental software and may not
be production ready.

Configuration
-------------
You can configure the PuppetDB host and port through
${INSTDIR}/puppetboard/default_settings.py

PuppetDB
--------
Puppetboard requires PuppetDB 4, however compatability with PuppetDB 3
is available (though PuppetDB 3 was never ported to OpenBSD).

    pkg_add puppetdb

Starting puppetboard
--------------------

By default Puppetboard will bind to 127.0.0.1:8000, to adjust this
puppetboard_flags will need to be set in /etc/rc.conf.local. Please refer to the
gunicorn documentation for the available options.

Please note that there is currently no SSL support. It is therefore
recommended you run puppetboard on the same host as PuppetDB is running.
