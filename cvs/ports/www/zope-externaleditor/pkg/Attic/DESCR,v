@Kill Zope and friends that only run under python 2.4.
ok by many.

@The Zope External Editor is a new way to integrate Zope more seamlessly with
client-side tools. It has the following features:
  - Edit objects locally, directly from the ZMI.
  - Works with any graphical editor application that can open a file from the
    command line, including: emacs, gvim, xemacs, nedit, gimp, etc.
  - Automatically saves changes back to Zope without ending the editing
    session.
  - Associate any client-side editor application with any Zope object by
    meta-type or content-type. Both text and binary object content can be
    edited.
  - Locks objects while they are being edited. Automatically unlocks them when
    the editing session ends.
  - Can add file extensions automatically to improve syntax highlighting or
    file type detection.
  - Works with basic auth, cookie auth and Zope versions. Credentials are
    automatically passed down to the helper application. No need to
    reauthenticate.
  - HTTPS support (Openssl required)
