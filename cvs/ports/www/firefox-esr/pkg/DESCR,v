@Import firefox ESR 24.1.1.

Firefox ESR is intended for groups who deploy and maintain the desktop
environment in large organizations such as universities and other
schools, county or city governments and businesses. During the extended
cycle, no new features will be added to a Firefox ESR; only
high-risk/high-impact security vulnerabilities or major stability fixes
will be corrected.

Note that using it on OpenBSD is NOT supported by mozilla. People
willing to deploy it should subscribe to the EWG mailing list.

Installs as firefox-esr and doesnt conflict with mainline www/mozilla-firefox.
Learn to use several profiles if you plan to use both.
