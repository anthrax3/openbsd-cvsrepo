Initial import of phpicalendar-1.1

PHP iCalendar is a php-based iCal file parser. Its based on v2.0 of the
IETF spec. It displays iCal files in a nice logical, clean manner with
day, week, month, and year navigation, printer view, RSS-enabled, and
searchable. It supports 12 languages, is fully theme-able, and has
complete timezone support.
