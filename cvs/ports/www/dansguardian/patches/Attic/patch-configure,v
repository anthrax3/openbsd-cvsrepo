@- update dansguardian to 2.10.0.3

- remove clamav flavour in favour of enabling clamd support in
the main package.

- rearrange the Makefile slightly

the clamav flavour was using libclamav, which past experience shows
to not be a stable interface to the clamav virus scanner; dansguardian
also supports scanning via the clamd socket, this is now enabled
instead (by default since it doesn't add a required dependency).

note: those currently using the clamav flavour and upgrading will
need to adjust their configuration.

maintainer timeout. on ports@@ for a few days, lightly tested here
but lacking test reports from real users.

@DansGuardian is an award winning Open Source web content filter which
currently runs on Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, Mac OS X, HP-UX, and
Solaris. It filters the actual content of pages based on many methods
including phrase matching, PICS filtering and URL filtering. It does not
purely filter based on a banned list of sites like lesser totally
commercial filters.
