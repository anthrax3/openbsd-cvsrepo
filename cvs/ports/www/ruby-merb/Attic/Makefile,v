@SUBDIR += is wrong: it means the makefile will pick up SUBDIR from env, thus
breaking cd /usr/ports && SUBDIR=some/path make something for
category makefiles. While there, also put spaces around += uniformously.

@Initial import of ruby-merb-0.9.2.

Like Ruby on Rails, Merb is an MVC framework. Unlike Rails, Merb is
ORM-agnostic, JavaScript library agnostic, and template language
agnostic, preferring plugins that add in support for a particular
feature rather than trying to produce a monolithic library with
everything in the core. In fact, this is a guiding principle of the
project, which has led to third-party support for the ActiveRecord,
DataMapper, and Sequel ORMs.
