@Fold w3m-m17n as flavor back into w3m.

@This code is a total nightmare.

A pain to read, and lots of strcpy/strcat/sprintf's which actually
turn out to be okay, after adding a die-when-out-of-memory callback
for the boehm garbage collector.

There are undoubtedly other issues with this code.  Caveat user.

@Import w3m-m17n 0.19, based off w3m 0.2.1.

w3m is a pager/text-based WWW browser.  This is the multilingualization
(m17n) version.

It used to be a flavor of www/w3m but the different versions keep diverging.
