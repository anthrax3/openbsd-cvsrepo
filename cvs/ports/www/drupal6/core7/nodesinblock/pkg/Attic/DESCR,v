@Nodes in block makes it possible to add nodes into a block. A number of
configurable blocks are generated which you can assign to a region.
Visibility settings of this block are automatically set to 'Show on only
the listed pages'. On the node content form, you define the weight and
visibility per node thus making it easier for content administration as
all your content is now in the same place. With this module, you don't
have to explain your customers how blocks work but is still able to
decide on which pages content must be rendered.
