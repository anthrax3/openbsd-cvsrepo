@Compact Forms presents text fields for selected forms in a more compact fashion
using jQuery.

The form item/element fields are overlaid with their respective labels.  When
the user focuses a field the label fades away nicely, and if the field is left
empty the label fades back in again.

By default, only the user login block is switched to compact style, but the
behavior can be added to any form by adding the corresponding CSS ids to the
Compact Forms configuration.
