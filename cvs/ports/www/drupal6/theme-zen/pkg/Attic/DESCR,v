@The idea behind the Zen theme is to have a very flexible standards-
compliant and semantically correct XHTML theme that can be highly
modified through CSS and an enhanced version of Drupal's template
system.  Out of the box, Zen is clean and simple with either a one,
two, or three column layout of fixed or liquid width. In addition,
the HTML source order has content placed before sidebars or the navbar
for increased accessibility and SEO.

@import the Drupal Zen theme (6x-2.0):

The idea behind the Zen theme is to have a very flexible standards-
compliant and semantically correct XHTML theme that can be highly
modified through CSS and an enhanced version of Drupal's template
system.  Out of the box, Zen is clean and simple with either a one,
two, or three column layout of fixed or liquid width. In addition,
the HTML source order has content placed before sidebars or the navbar
