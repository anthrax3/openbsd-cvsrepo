@Import dokuwiki.

DokuWiki is a standards compliant, simple to use Wiki, mainly aimed at
creating documentation of any kind. It is targeted at developer teams,
workgroups and small companies. It has a simple but powerful syntax
which makes sure the datafiles remain readable outside the Wiki and
eases the creation of structured texts. All data is stored in plain text
files, no database is required.

With tweaks/feedbacks from landry@@, thanks.
