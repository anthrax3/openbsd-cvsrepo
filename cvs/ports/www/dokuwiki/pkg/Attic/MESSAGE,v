@Dokuwiki has been installed into ${INSTDIR}

With Apache, this directory must be granted at least with this:
     AllowOverride Limit

You should point this to the DocumentRoot of your web-server:
   # ln -s ../dokuwiki /var/www/htdocs/dokuwiki

Then add to your httpd.conf:
   <Directory /var/www/dokuwiki>
	AllowOverride Limit
   </Directory>

Proceed to complete the installation by opening install.php in your browser.
If you are upgrading your installation, don't forget to remove install.php.

@Import dokuwiki.

DokuWiki is a standards compliant, simple to use Wiki, mainly aimed at
creating documentation of any kind. It is targeted at developer teams,
workgroups and small companies. It has a simple but powerful syntax
which makes sure the datafiles remain readable outside the Wiki and
eases the creation of structured texts. All data is stored in plain text
files, no database is required.

With tweaks/feedbacks from landry@@, thanks.
