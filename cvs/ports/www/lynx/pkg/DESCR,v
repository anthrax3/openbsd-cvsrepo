@Lynx is a fully-featured World Wide Web (WWW) client for users running
cursor-addressable, character-cell display devices (e.g., vt100
terminals, vt100 emulators running on PCs or Macs, or any other
character-cell display). It will display Hypertext Markup Language
(HTML) documents containing links to files on the local system, as well
as files on remote systems running http, gopher, ftp, wais, nntp,
finger, or cso/ph/qi servers, and services accessible via logins to
telnet, tn3270 or rlogin accounts (see URL Schemes Supported by Lynx).

Lynx can be used to access information on the WWW, or to build
information systems intended primarily for local access. For example,
Lynx has been used to build several Campus Wide Information Systems
(CWIS). In addition, Lynx can be used to build systems isolated within a
single LAN.

lynx is a program which allows a user to access World-Wide Web servers
and other information servers.  It uses only ascii representation so
that it can be used from ascii-terminals and dialin-lines.

lynx(1) was added to OpenBSD release 2.3.  Therefore, it can be used
without installing this port.  However, to maintain backward compatibility
with those who may have hard coded the path to lynx, the port can be'
installed.  The installation will create a symbolic link to the released
version of lynx.  A pkg_delete of this port will remove the link.

log
@port no longer needed as lynx now part of standard OpenBSD release.
Change install to create link /usr/local/bin/lynx ==> /usr/bin/lynx
Change delete to remove the link.
