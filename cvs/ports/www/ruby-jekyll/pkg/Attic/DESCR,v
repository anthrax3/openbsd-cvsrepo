@remove ruby-jekyll, the version we have is so outdated it doesn't play nice
with the rest of the gems we have in tree. but more importantly, there's been
no interest in updating this port since 2 years. updated versions rely on
inotify which isn't going to fly.

@Jekyll is a simple, blog aware, static site generator. It takes a
template directory (representing the raw form of a website), runs it
through Textile or Markdown and Liquid converters, and spits out a
complete, static website suitable for serving with Apache or your
favorite web server.
