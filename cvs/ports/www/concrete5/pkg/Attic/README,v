@remove cms-ms and concrete5,

having this as a port has no additional value as pkg_add is just a

| Running ${FULLPKGNAME} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Concrete5 has been installed into ${INSTDIR}

You should point this to the DocumentRoot of your web-server:
   # ln -s ../concrete5 /var/www/htdocs/concrete5
(make sure you use a relative symlink since Apache is chrooted)

You can ensure you have a working install by accessing:
http://<localhost>/concrete5/index.php
