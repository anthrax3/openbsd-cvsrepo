Documentation
=============
Complete project documentation may be found in:
${PREFIX}/share/doc/${LNAME}/

or online:
http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/${MODPY_EGG_VERSION}/

Release notes about the changes that occurred in this release
may be found online at:
http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/releases/${MODPY_EGG_VERSION}/

Databases
=========
Django supports number of different databases, but you need
to install Python database adapter(s) to use them:
* py-mysql - for MySQL database, 
* py-psycopg2 - for PostgreSQL database.

SQLite works out-of-the-box.

UTF-8
=====
Django assumes that you're running UTF-8 capable system, but
it doesn't enforce any locales, which results in regressions
when running in an environment without enabled UTF-8 locale.

This means that, unless you've got UTF-8 locale enabled for
your profile, you need to enable UTF-8 while starting Django
process:

    $ env LC_CTYPE=en_US.UTF-8 ./manage.py runserver

or configure your application server to pass this setting.

Python 3
========
Django 1.5 is the first Django release with support for 
Python 3 (specifically, Python 3.2 and newer). Python 3 
support is still considered experimental so please use at 
your own risk.
