@remove drupal5, which will soon be end-of-life. Switch to drupal6, please. explicit ok sthen@@, aja@@

@To enable a decent configuration of drupal, please create a symbolic
link from ${PREFIX}/conf/modules.sample/drupal.conf
to ${PREFIX}/conf/modules/drupal.conf

ln -s ${PREFIX}/conf/modules.sample/drupal.conf \
	${PREFIX}/conf/modules

It is highly recommended to setup https (see SSL(8)) and to
enable securelogin.

In order to run with standard OpenBSD chroot'ed httpd:

- make sure you can connect to your database.

Create a directory for the mysql socket.

	mkdir -p /var/www/var/run/mysql

Adjust ${SYSCONFDIR}/my.cnf to put the mysql socket into the chroot.

	[client]
	socket = /var/www/var/run/mysql/mysql.sock

	[mysqld]
	socket = /var/www/var/run/mysql/mysql.sock

Don't forget to set the character set to utf8 in your database.

In mysql, assuming you're connected as admin initially.

create user drupal@@localhost identified by 'password';
create database drupal character set utf8;
grant all on drupal.* to drupal@@localhost;

In postgresql, assuming an `admin' account has all rights:

createuser -U admin --pwprompt --no-superuser --createdb --no-createrole drupal
createdb -U drupal -E UTF8 drupal

For mysql on localhost, run the following snippet AFTER
you make sure your mysql daemon is running:

create user drupal identified by password('clearpassword');

log
@put stuff in the right location, namely, not with core.

PEOPLE WHO TESTED drupal BEFORE:
You *must* disable extra modules and themes from a working drupal install
before the update, and reenable them afterwards.

If you forgot to,
- ln all the stuff in sites/all/modules and sites/all/themes to modules and themes
- check your site runs again, disable extra stuff
- remove the links and re-enable stuff.
