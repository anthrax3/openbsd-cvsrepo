@A fresh design that balances simplicity, soft, neutral background
colors, plenty of whitespace and big nice typography.

List of features:

    * Standards-compliant XHTML 1.0 Strict and CSS (No CSS hacks).
    * Liquid CSS layout (tableless) - the whole layout increases
    or decreases proportionally as dimensions are specified in ems.
    Try changing the font size to see this working.
    * Supports one, two and three columns.
    * Cross-browser compatible. Works fine in Firefox 2.0 and IE 6.
    * Cute icons (all GPL or created by myself).
    * Coded with SEO in mind, the order of the columns are 2dn, 3rd
    and 1st - usually the 1st is intended for navigation, the other
    two for content, Google likes that.
    * Slinding doors tabs for primary links that blend with main content area.
