@Unfortunately Drupal does not include the powers of immortality or
invincibility. You may someday get hit by a truck, or even just
decide that you no longer want to maintain the site. So someone
else may have to take over.

Where do they start? I know you documented the site really well,
but the next person doesn't want to read those 14 binders of
documentation you left behind. They can always go through all the
administration screens and look for the information, but that can
take a lot of time and even those pages don't tell you everything.
Some things you're only going to get by looking directly into the
database.

This is what the Site Documentation module is designed to do. In
addition, it will detect some problems that may exist in your
installation, and optionally correct some of them.
