@This module will display any Views date field in calendar formats,
including CCK date fields, Event module event fields, node created
or updated dates, etc. Switch between year, month, and day views.
Back and next navigation is provided for all views.

Note that calendar is a bit difficult to set up correctly, but it is
fairly useful.

Setup:

    * Select the Calendar display as the page type for your view.
If you want to have a mini calendar available in a block, select
the Calendar display as the block type as well as the page type.

    * Add any fields you want to display on the calendar as fields
to the view. Be sure to include fields that contain the dates that
need to be shown on the calendar. Date fields can include CCK date
fields, event start and end dates, or dates like the node created
or updated dates. If you use CCK date fields, set them to 'Do not
group multiple values' so each value will display in its own date
box.

    * Add three arguments to the view: Calendar Year, Calendar
Month, and Calendar Day, in that order. Set each of them to 'Display
All Values'.

    * Add sorts to the view for each date field so the dates are
sorted correctly.

    * In most cases, add a Node: Type filter to filter the view by
the content types that contain your selected date fields. The default
view has a Node: Type filter that selects all node types. Change
it to select only the node types you want in your calendar.
