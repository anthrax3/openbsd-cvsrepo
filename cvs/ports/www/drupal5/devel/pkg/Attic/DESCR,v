@A suite of modules containing fun for both module and theme developers

* helper functions for Drupal developers and inquisitive admins.
This module can print a summary of all database queries for each
page request at the bottom of each page. The summary includes how
many times each query was executed on a page (shouldn't run same
query multiple times), and how long each query took (short is good
- use cache for complex queries).
* Also a dprint_r($array) function is provided, which pretty prints
arrays. Useful during development. Similarly, a ddebug_backtrace()
is offerred.
