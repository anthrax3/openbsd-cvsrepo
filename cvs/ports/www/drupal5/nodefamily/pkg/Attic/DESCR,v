@With this module you can define relations between content types.
It automatically creates a relation between all nodes, which have
been created from the same user and have the defined content types.

It is a simple node relationship module, which doesn't provide any
enduser interface. Relations are set automatically (based on admin
defined content type relations) or programmatically through its
API. It also allows to restrict the population of a content type
(the number of creatable nodes of a content type per user).

The module doesn't display related nodes when viewing a node or
anything similar. Currently it's up to the user to use the relation,
e.g. use it to display related nodes during viewing a node (example
provided) or use it for generating views in conjunction with views
fusion
