@remove mindterm, because:
- java implementation of an ssh client that hasn't been updated in 12 years;
- non-free and we can't update because the distfile is behind a registrationf
  form now;
- oh, and it doesn't even work...

@MindTerm is an implementation of a secure shell client in pure Java
supporting both the SSH1 and the SSH2 protocols.  MindTerm runs as a
standalone application as well as an Applet.  As an applet, MindTerm has
been tested with Netscape Communicator and Microsoft Internet Explorer
browsers.  As an application, MindTerm requires that a Java runtime
environment (JRE) be installed and should work with any 1.1.x runtime on
most platforms.

MindTerm v1.99 is a SSH client program written in 100% pure Java.
MindTerm can be run as a stand-alone program, or as an applet in a
webpage.  Apart from supporting both ssh1 and ssh2, it has some
unique features such as built in scp file transfer and a built in
ftp-proxy which works with ordinary ftpds behind the sshd.
