@Import of mindterm 1.9.9.

from DESCR:
MindTerm v1.99 is a SSH client program written in 100% pure Java.
MindTerm can be run as a stand-alone program, or as an applet in a
webpage.  Apart from supporting both ssh1 and ssh2, it has some
unique features such as built in scp file transfer and a built in
ftp-proxy which works with ordinary ftpds behind the sshd.
