@This module was inspired by HTML::FormatText::WithLinks which has
proven to be a useful `lynx -dump` work-alike.  However one frustration
was that no other HTML converters I came across had the ability to
deal affectively with HTML <TABLE>s.  This module can in a rudimentary
sense do so.  The aim was to provide facility to take a simple HTML
based email template, and to also convert it to text with the <TABLE>
structure intact for inclusion as "multipart/alternative" content.
Further, it will preserve both the formatting specified by the <TD>
tag's "align" attribute, and will also preserve multiline text
inside of a <TD> element provided it is broken using <BR/> tags.
