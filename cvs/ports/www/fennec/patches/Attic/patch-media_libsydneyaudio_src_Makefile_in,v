@Remove devel/xulrunner/1.9, www/fennec, www/firefox36 and productivity/sunbird

- nothing uses xulrunner 1.9 anymore, and that branch was EOL'd upstream
  20 months ago (firefox36 was already unlinked from the build)
- www/fennec as a xul app is dead upstream, since now firefox mobile is
  built on top of java android libs and thus unportable to regular OS.
The esr10 branch from which it was built upon was EOL'd upstream 10 months ago
- productivity/sunbird as a standalone app is dead upstream since 3
  years, hypothetical users should just use thunderbird+lightning which
is still supported/developed.

No complains from ports@@, this will allow for a serious mozilla ports
cleanup, and we're down to 5 mozillas in the ports tree.

@Import fennec 4.0:

Firefox for mobile (codenamed Fennec) is the name of the build of the
Mozilla Firefox web browser for devices such as mobile phones and
personal digital assistants (PDAs).
While it initially targets android and maemo, it also works on desktop
machines, and can be useful on small screens or low-powered devices.

Looks ok to jasper@@
