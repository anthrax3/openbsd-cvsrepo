1.1.2.1
log
@MFC: Update to version 2.6.3
Security bugfixes:
Cross-site scripting vulnerabilities in the HTML filter were fixed.
A parsing bug was fixed where malformed address fields can cause
MHonArc to hang.
--
Note:
Due to the insane number of security issues that this port has been
suffering from, this will be the last MFC of MHonArc.
Therefore if another security bug affects it, this port will be marked
as BROKEN or even removed from the ports tree.
This was discussed with brad@@ and pvalchev@@
