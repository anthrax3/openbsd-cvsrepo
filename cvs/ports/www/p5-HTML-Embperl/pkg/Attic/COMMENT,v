1.1.1.1
log
@Embperl gives you the power to embed Perl code in your HTML documents
and the ability to build your Web site out of small reusable objects
in a OO-style. You can also take advantage all available Perl
modules, (including DBI for database access) use their functionality
and easily include their output into your web pages.

NOTE: that the build warns about File::Spec being out of date, but this
appears to have no noticable effect in my tests. If someone finds a
problem, then a p5-File-Spec port is required at a later date.
