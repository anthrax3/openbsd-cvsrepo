This document will briefly describe the steps needed before one can
complete the Status.net installation. After taking these steps you
should be able to browse to http://<hostname>/statusnet/install.php
and complete the installation.

Please refer to http://gitorious.org/statusnet/mainline/blobs/master/README
for a complete overview of how to setup Status.net with advanced features.

== Apache ==

You should point the Status.net installation directory to the
DocumentRoot of your web-server:
    # ln -s ../statusnet /var/www/htdocs/statusnet
(make sure you use a relative symlink since Apache is chrooted)

== MySQL==

Please add the php5-mysql package to enable MySQL support in PHP.

MySQL users running with chroot'ed httpd might like to take the
following steps to place the mysql socket inside the chroot:

Create a directory for the mysql socket.

        mkdir -p /var/www/var/run/mysql

Adjust your my.cnf to put the mysql socket into the chroot,

        [client]
        socket = /var/www/var/run/mysql/mysql.sock

        [mysqld]
        socket = /var/www/var/run/mysql/mysql.sock

and set DBSocket in the Status.net configuration appropriately.

Now connect to MySQL and create a user and database for Status.net:

    	  mysqladmin -u "username" --password="password" create statusnet

          mysql> GRANT ALL on statusnet.*
	  TO 'statusnet'@@'localhost'
	  IDENTIFIED BY 'statnetpassword';

== PostgreSQL ==

Please add the php5-pqsql package to enable PostgreSQL support in PHP.

Assuming you have an administrative account named `postgres',
you can create the 'statusnet' user and database like this:

	createuser -U postgres --pwprompt --no-superuser \
		--createdb --no-createrole statusnet

Now you can create the database for Status.net with:

	pgsql -U statusnet
	psql> create database statusnet
	psql> \q

StatusNet (formerly Laconica) is a Free and Open Source microblogging
platform. It helps people in a community, company or group to exchange
short (140 character) messages over the Web. Users can choose which
people to "follow" and receive only their friends' or colleagues' status
messages. It provides a similar service to sites like Twitter, Jaiku,
Yammer, and Plurk.

not hooking it up to the builds yet, as it will need some more tweaking
to set up.
