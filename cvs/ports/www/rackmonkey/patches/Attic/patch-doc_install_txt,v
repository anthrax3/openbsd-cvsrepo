 5. Configuring RackMonkey
 =========================
 Configuration is stored in a text file, which is read from 
-/etc/rackmonkey.conf by default. If you're happy with this location, simply 
-copy conf/rackmonkey.conf-default to /etc/rackmonkey.conf and proceed to the 
-'Editing Configuration' section (below).
+/conf/rackmonkey.conf by default (to suit OpenBSD httpd running in
+a chroot jail). If you use 'httpd -u' to disable the chroot, follow the
+next section to change the path to /var/www/conf/rackmonkey.conf.
+Otherwise proceed to the 'Editing Configuration' section (below).
 
 NB. If you're using Postgres or MySQL, this configuration file may contain 
 your database username and password. For maximum security only root (or the

 NB. This path must be writable by the web server and should not be within
 web space, or users will be able to download your database. As we're using
 SQLite you can leave the DBUSER and DBPASS values blank. Make sure the

 For SQLite
 ----------
+Note that the OpenBSD package provides a pre-configured base database
+for SQLite.
+
 Make a note of the path you specified for 'dbconnect' in section 5, then run 
 following commands:
 
-    $ sqlite3 [PATH] < sql/schema/schema.sqlite.sql
-    $ sqlite3 [PATH] < sql/data/default_data.sql
-    $ sqlite3 [PATH] < sql/data/sample_data.sql
+    $ cd /var/www/rackmonkey
+    $ DBPATH=db/rackmonkey.db
+    $ sqlite3 $DBPATH < sql/schema/schema.sqlite.sql
+    $ sqlite3 $DBPATH < sql/data/default_data.sql
+    $ sqlite3 $DBPATH < sql/data/sample_data.sql
     
 You should then change the permissions of the database file and its parent
 directory to be readable and writable by your web server. For example, you
 might change the owner to 'www' if that is the user your web server runs 
 under.
+
+    $ chown root:www $DBPATH; chmod 770 ${DBPATH}

RackMonkey is a tool for managing racks of equipment such as servers
and switches. You can keep track of what's where, which OS it runs,
who it belongs to and what it's used for. RackMonkey quickly finds
any device and draws a rack diagram of its location.
