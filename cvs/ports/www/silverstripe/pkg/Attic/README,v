+-----------------------------------------------------------------------
| Running ${FULLPKGNAME} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SilverStripe has been installed into ${INSTDIR}

You should point this to the DocumentRoot of your web-server:
  # ln -s ../silverstripe /var/www/htdocs/silverstripe
(make sure you use a relative symlink since Apache is chrooted)

Database
========
SilverStripe can work with a PostgreSQL or MySQL database. According
to which database is used, the corresponding package needs to be
installed:
    php-pgsql or php-mysqli

Webserver
=========
SilverStripe needs to have rewrite support enabled in the webserver.
For Apache uncomment the following line in /var/www/conf/httpd.conf:

	LoadModule rewrite_module	/usr/lib/apache/modules/mod_rewrite.so

And set "AllowOverride All" for the directory in which SilverStripe has been
installed.

Finishing the installation
==========================
Please refer to the online documentation available at:
http://doc.silverstripe.org/framework/en/installation/
