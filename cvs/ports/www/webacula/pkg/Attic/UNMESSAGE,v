@It makes no sense to distribute some webapps using the pkg tools when it's
just a matter of following upstream and untarring under htdocs.
webapp as a pkg needs to have some added value and no, 'pkg_add webapp' is
not easier if the app has actually no maintainer -- it is safer to follow
upstream.
webacula is one of them and is not even maintained upstream, so zap it.

@To completely deinstall webacula you need to perform the following steps
as root:
    # rm -f /var/www/conf/modules/webacula.conf
    # ${INSTDIR}/webacula-chroot-bconsole disable

*** WARNING ***
/var/www/bin/sh, /var/www/usr/libexec/ld.so and files under
/var/www/lib/ may be shared by other executable(s) in the chroot(8), so
when running 'webacula-chroot-bconsole disable', make sure nothing else
uses these files or you will need to reinstall them manually
