@It makes no sense to distribute some webapps using the pkg tools when it's
just a matter of following upstream and untarring under htdocs.
webapp as a pkg needs to have some added value and no, 'pkg_add webapp' is
not easier if the app has actually no maintainer -- it is safer to follow
upstream.
webacula is one of them and is not even maintained upstream, so zap it.
