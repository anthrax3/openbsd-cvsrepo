@Import www/conkeror: keyboard-oriented Mozilla-based browser

Conkeror is a keyboard-oriented, highly-customizable, highly-extensible
web browser based on Mozilla XULRunner, written mainly in JavaScript,
and inspired by exceptional software such as Emacs and vi. Conkeror
features a sophisticated keyboard system, allowing users to run
commands and interact with content in powerful and novel ways. It is
self-documenting, featuring a powerful interactive help system.
