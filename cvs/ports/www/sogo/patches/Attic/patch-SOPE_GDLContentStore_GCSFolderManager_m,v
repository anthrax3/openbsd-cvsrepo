@$OpenBSD: patch-SOPE_GDLContentStore_GCSFolderManager_m,v 1.1 2011/06/07 11:29:55 sebastia Exp $

stringByDeletingLastPathComponent must not be used with URLs as it
replaces doubles slashes with a single slash, e.g. "mysql://" with
"mysql:/".

log
@gnustep-base made the -[NSString stringByDeletingLastPathComponent] more compatible with MAC OS X, which now breaks SOGo creation of new users since it relied on a side effect from the incompatibility.
Pointed out and patch from Andreas VÃ¶gele, many thanks.
While there, remove hard dependency to www/sope having the same version as sogo

sure landry@@, OK jasper@@
