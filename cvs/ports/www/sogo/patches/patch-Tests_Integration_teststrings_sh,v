1.1
log
@Update to 2.3.2

Major verion jump, on upgrade, which includes a DB schema change.
For additional upgrade instructions to the usual ones, check the README.

Enable a couple of tests that don't require a configuration, and DB etc.
Thought 3 are failing.

OK giovanni@@ (who also gave OK for www/sogo)
