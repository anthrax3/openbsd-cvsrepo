@Update to version 5.1.4;

Add a hardened flavor for both core and extensions (inspired by niallo@@);
Use our own way to install pear because the bundled installer is totally
broken and upstream refuses to fix it.

Add a mysqli subpackage which can be used to access the functionality
provided by MySQL 4.1 and above.

Other minor changes and fixes are also included.

ok sturm@@; tested by many
