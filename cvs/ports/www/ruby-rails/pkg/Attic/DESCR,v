@Remove www/ruby-rails and dependencies.  The current version is
out of date and subject to serious security vulnerabilities, updating
it causes a lot of ports churn for little benefit, and nobody has
offered to maintain it.

@Rails is a web-application framework for the MVC pattern that includes
both a template engine, controller framework, and object-relational
mapping package. Everything needed to develop web-apps that can run on
CGI, FastCGI, and mod_ruby

Being a full-stack framework means that all layers are built to work
seamlessly together. That way you Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) and you
can use a single language from top to bottom. Everything from templates
to control flow to business logic is written in Ruby - The language of
love for industry heavy-weights.
