log
@Update to firefox 22.0.

- see http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/22.0/releasenotes/ (ok,
  webrtc isnt enabled yet by default on *BSD but we're working on it :)
- fixes MFSA 2013-49->62
- remove all patches related to sydneyaudio which got removed upstream,
  sound uses libcubeb which has a native sndio backend since ages (thx
to ratchov!). also remove related post-patch target while here.
- add temporary workaround (TERM=xterm) for bug #878089
- switch i386 to use clang again, using --disable-debug-symbols to make
  the code smaller (who said 'gross hack' ?)
- update patch-gfx_thebes_gfxPlatform_cpp to match what got commited
  upstream in r52b02042b27f
- remove patch-js_src_vm_SPSProfiler_cpp which unbroke powerpc, finally
  got commited in 22 branch
- rework fx-i18n's MESSAGE to be more in line with reality (discussed
  with Marcus Merighi)
