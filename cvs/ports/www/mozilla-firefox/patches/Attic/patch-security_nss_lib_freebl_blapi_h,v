@Remove all patches applying to local copy of nss/nspr, as we now use the
systemwide on (which have all those patches). Don't call autoconf in
nsprpub/ while here, and bump PKGNAME to be on the safe side.

@$OpenBSD: patch-security_nss_lib_freebl_blapi_h,v 1.1 2010/04/26 19:55:58 landry Exp $

SHA1_Update conflicts with openssl which may be dynamically loaded
at runtime via libcups or libgssapi so causing a crash due to using
the wrong binding.  So rename here to avoid conflict.

@Update www/mozilla-firefox from 3.0.19 to 3.6.3, merging the wip done in
www/firefox36 mostly by martynas@@ and naddy@@.
Note that the java plugin from devel/jdk currently doesn't work with this
version of firefox, in the meantime users really needed it will have to
use www/firefox35.
ok naddy@@
