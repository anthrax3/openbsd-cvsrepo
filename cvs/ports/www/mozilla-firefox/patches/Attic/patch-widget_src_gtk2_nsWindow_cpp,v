Don't try to use png icons when setting app icon for window manager
Firefox uses itss building libpng for APNG support, and gdk_pixbuf_new_from_file
bails out later on when trying to load png files.

@Update to mozilla-firefox 3.6.6. Fixes a bunch of MFSA, see
http://www.mozilla.org/security/known-vulnerabilities/firefox36.html
The new plugin sandboxing code is disabled because :
- it only supports binary blobs plugins we don't have
- it is an horrible maze of #ifdef linux-apple-win32 coming straight
  from an old version of chromium. Future versions should have better BSD
support..
tested by several on ports@@, thanks!

log
@Firefox uses its own libpng (for animated png support), and apparently
it breaks loading png icons through gdk_pixbuf_new_from_file as gtk is
linked with systemwide png. This went unnoticed so far as firefox always
shipped a fallback xpm icon, but this is not the case anymore, so now
gtk_window_set_icon_list() is not called anymore, and the window manager
shows the default icon for firefox windows in taskbar/tasklists..
So add graphics/netpbm as a build dependency, do the necessary netpbm
magic in do-install to create the default.xpm from mozicon128.png, and
patch widget/src/gtk2/nsWindow.cpp to not try to load png icons.
While here fix icon path in desktop file, and add a comment about why we
don't use systemwide png.

@Update www/mozilla-firefox from 3.0.19 to 3.6.3, merging the wip done in
www/firefox36 mostly by martynas@@ and naddy@@.
Note that the java plugin from devel/jdk currently doesn't work with this
version of firefox, in the meantime users really needed it will have to
use www/firefox35.
ok naddy@@
