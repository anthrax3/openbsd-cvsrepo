@Update to firefox 22.0.

- see http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/22.0/releasenotes/ (ok,
  webrtc isnt enabled yet by default on *BSD but we're working on it :)
- fixes MFSA 2013-49->62
- remove all patches related to sydneyaudio which got removed upstream,
  sound uses libcubeb which has a native sndio backend since ages (thx
to ratchov!). also remove related post-patch target while here.
- add temporary workaround (TERM=xterm) for bug #878089
- switch i386 to use clang again, using --disable-debug-symbols to make
  the code smaller (who said 'gross hack' ?)
- update patch-gfx_thebes_gfxPlatform_cpp to match what got commited
  upstream in r52b02042b27f
- remove patch-js_src_vm_SPSProfiler_cpp which unbroke powerpc, finally
  got commited in 22 branch
- rework fx-i18n's MESSAGE to be more in line with reality (discussed
  with Marcus Merighi)

@Update to firefox 15.0.

- see http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/15.0/releasenotes/
- add -Os hack to fix a relocation error when linking on ppc (as was
  done in tb since 10..)
- garbage collect nsSound.cpp, the original one uses libcanberra
  properly and thus sndio.
- remove patch from #750620, merged upstream (mfbt/double-conversion)
- remove patches from #747257, merged upstream (gstreamer fix)
- remove patches from #691898, merged upstream (yarr jit ppc)

@Update www/mozilla-firefox from 3.0.19 to 3.6.3, merging the wip done in
www/firefox36 mostly by martynas@@ and naddy@@.
Note that the java plugin from devel/jdk currently doesn't work with this
version of firefox, in the meantime users really needed it will have to
use www/firefox35.
ok naddy@@
