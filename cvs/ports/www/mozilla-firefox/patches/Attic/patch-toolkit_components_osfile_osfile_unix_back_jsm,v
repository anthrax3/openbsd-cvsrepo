1.2
log
@Update to firefox 17.0.

- see http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/17.0/releasenotes/ for details
- enable the gio/libnotify interaction, since it brings no additional
  dep. libnotify will be dlopened at runtime if present, and gio is
already in the dependency chain. The latter will interact with the gio mime
database for file associations, and firefox will ask the user if he
wants to register it as the default http:// handler. The former will
show a notify popup upon download completion, among others.
- add build depends on yasm in i386/amd64 for webm
- remove patch-browser_app_profile_firefox_js, the updater is already disabled
- remove gstreamer patches from #776838, #777696 & #747257, merged upstream
- remove ipc_message_utils.h patch from #775428, commited upstream
- remove mozalloc.cpp patch, <sys/types.h> is already included above
- remove xpcshell hang patchset from #706955, cant reproduce anymore
- remove patch-security_manager_ssl_src_Makefile_in, unneeded
- remove OS.File extra logging from #785200, merged upstream
- add patch-toolkit_system_gnome_nsGIOService_cpp, workaround for
  #805202 (libgio-2.0.so dlopening), to be removed in fx 19
- remove xpcom arm patch from #783875, merged upstream
