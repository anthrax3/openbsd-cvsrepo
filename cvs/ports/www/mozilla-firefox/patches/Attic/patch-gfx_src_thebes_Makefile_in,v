@Update to mozilla-firefox 5.0:

That's the first release following the new fast scheme of one major
release every 6 weeks..
Check out http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/5.0/releasenotes/ for
release notes. Note that it's still badly broken on sparc64, and
unlikely to be fixed soon... you still have www/firefox36.

Tested by (at least, probably forgetting some..) rpointel@@, pea@@,
ckuethe@@ and myself on amd64, bluhm@@ on i386 and ajacoutot@@ on macppc
(thanks!)
ok rpointel@@

@Update www/mozilla-firefox from 3.0.19 to 3.6.3, merging the wip done in
www/firefox36 mostly by martynas@@ and naddy@@.
Note that the java plugin from devel/jdk currently doesn't work with this
version of firefox, in the meantime users really needed it will have to
use www/firefox35.

@it is the right time to update to mozilla-firefox-3.0.4, which has
been tested good enough, and i've fixed all the issues i'm aware
of.  furthermore 2.0 branch has basically reached eol, since there
will be only one minor update (2.0.0.19)
