@Update to firefox 32.0

- see https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/32.0/releasenotes/
- remove patch-toolkit_components_downloads_nsDownloadManager_cpp and
  patch-xpcom_io_SpecialSystemDirectory_cpp fiddling with modes when
creating user dirs, they never made sense to me, and this is the wrong
place to touch this.
- remove patch-webapprt_moz_build, patch-webapprt_gtk2_Makefile_in and
  patch-configure_in from #1012447, merged upstream

@Update to firefox 30.0.

- See http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/30.0/releasenotes/
- Fixes MFSA 2014-48->54
- Switch to use gstreamer 1.0 by default
- Add a bunch of patches from #992613, #991613, #1012447 to build
  properly with gtk3
- Note that this fixes runtime on ppc which was broken since 29 (see
  #961488), which was quite a hairy one
- Still running fine on sparc64 !
