@Update to firefox 49.0.1.

See https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/49.0/releasenotes/ (.1 is for
a windows-only fix) - not that 'loop' (ex-firefox hello) was removed
from the browser.
- Fixes MFSA 2016-85
- Remove media/ffvpx/config.h patch, merged upstream/fixed differently in
bug #1239550
- Set media.autoplay.enabled to false by default, i'm usually wary of
  changing upstream defaults, but this one is unfuriating with "the
modern web and all this funky video ads".. this one got support from
many.
- Add a blurb to README explaining how to enable/test e10s/multi-process
  support.

@Update to firefox 29.0, with the brand new Australis UI.

- See http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/29.0/releasenotes/
- Fixes MFSA 2014-34->47
- add spellchecker.dictionary_path as a default pref in all-openbsd.js,
pointing to ${LOCALBASE}/share/mozilla-dicts/ so that it looks for
systemwide dictionaries.
- Remove now useless patch-extensions_spellcheck_hunspell_src_mozHunspell_cpp
- Add patch for #990196, tries to use INSTALL_SCRIPT during build which
  badly fails as user.

Note that starting with Fx 29, the sync protocol v1.1 used by
www/mozilla-sync still works but is not advertised anymore, and will be
phased out by v1.5 in Fx 31. www/mozilla-sync port will be updated in the
meantime, but users will have to reconfigure all their instances...

@Update to firefox 28.0.

- See http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/28.0/releasenotes/
- Fixes MFSA 2014-15->32
- add an all-openbsd.js file to modify default preferences instead of
  patching browser/app/profile/firefox.js like pigs. Install it in
browser/defaults/preferences/ so that it is effective by default for
newer profiles. Currently, we only use it to disable safebrowsing
feature..
- remove libffi patches, were merged upstream in #928390 and #928381
