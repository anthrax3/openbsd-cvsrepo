If you encounter strange problems relating to bookmarks, downloads,
window placement, toolbars, history, or other settings, it is
recommended that you create a new profile and attempt to
reproduce the problem before filing bugs.  To create a new profile,
start Firefox with the -ProfileManager switch, e.g.
firefox -ProfileManager, and click "Create Profile".

If Firefox doesn't start at all, try starting it with -safe-mode
switch, which disables extensions and themes for your session.

To disable anti-aliasing (xft) set GDK_USE_XFT=0 in the environment.

Using mailto: links

To enable mailto: links in Firefox to open in your mail program,
you may have to set a mailto protocol handler. Type "about:config"
in Firefox's URL text field.  Type "mailto" in the filter.  If there
is a string called "network.protocol-handler.app.mailto", its value
names the application for mailto URLs. If present, right click,
choose Modify, and enter the path to your mail program, e.g.,
"${LOCALBASE}/bin/thunderbird" or "${LOCALBASE}/bin/kmail" (other
programs may work, but these two have been tested).  If absent,
right click, choose New String. Set the name to
"network.protocol-handler.app.mailto" and the value to the path to
your mailer.

Plugins

Firefox looks for plugins in ~/.mozilla/plugins,
${TRUEPREFIX}/lib/mozilla/plugins, and ${TRUEPREFIX}/mozilla-firefox/plugins.
If the environment variable MOZ_PLUGIN_PATH is specified, this
location will be overridden.

Using Java Applets

To make Applets work, you must symlink (not copy) the file
libjavaplugin_oji.so into one of the directories listed above.
This might be done like the following:

$ cd ~/.mozilla/plugins
$ ln -s ${LOCALBASE}/jdk-1.5.0/jre/plugin/i386/ns7/libjavaplugin_oji.so .
$   

Information on building Java (on some platforms) can be found in
http://www.openbsd.org/faq/faq13.html#javaflash

Enabling ECC cipher suites

Open the URL about:config and type security.ssl3 in the search
filter. This will bring up a list of all available cipher suites.
Double-click on any cipher to toggle its state. For example, to
enable TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA, double-click on
security.ssl3.ecdhe_ecdsa_aes128_sha until its boolean entry in the
Value column changes to true.

Using CUPS and LPR for printing

Since version 3, Firefox uses the standard printing dialog from gtk+2.
In order to use CUPS for printing, you will need to install the cups
subpackage of gtk+2, i.e.:

# pkg_add gtk+2-cups

Debugging

If you encounter crashes, you might want to build the debug FLAVOR of
this package, and run 'firefox -g' to run firefox inside gdb, so
that you can gather debugging logs and traces.
Bug reports without that information will be ignored.

@Various cleanups, as done in www/firefox35 :

Gtk+2 doesn't try to use LPR printing backend by default.  In order
to use LPR for printing, create ~/.gtkrc-2.0 with the following
contents:

gtk-print-backends = "file,lpr,cups"

If you want to make this change available for all users, use
/etc/gtkrc instead of ~/.gtkrc-2.0.

If Firefox doesn't start at all, first try starting it with
-safe-mode switch, which disables extensions and themes for your
session.

If you still can't start Firefox, use the -debug flavor package instead.
If you can't fix the problem yourself, remember to provide output
when sending bug report.

Firefox will silently fail to print when it runs out of file
descriptors. If Firefox doesn't print a page increase your file
descriptors limit and try again.
