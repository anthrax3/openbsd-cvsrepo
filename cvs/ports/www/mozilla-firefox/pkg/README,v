+-----------------------------------------------------------------------
| Running ${FULLPKGNAME} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

If you encounter strange problems relating to bookmarks, downloads,
window placement, toolbars, history, or other settings, it is
recommended that you create a new profile and attempt to
reproduce the problem before filing bugs.  To create a new profile,
start Firefox with the -ProfileManager switch, e.g.
firefox -ProfileManager, and click "Create Profile".

If Firefox doesn't start at all, try starting it with -safe-mode
switch, which disables extensions and themes for your session.

Using mailto: links
===================
To enable mailto: links in Firefox to open in your mail program,
you may have to set a mailto protocol handler. Type "about:config"
in Firefox's URL text field.  Type "mailto" in the filter.  If there
is a string called "network.protocol-handler.app.mailto", its value
names the application for mailto URLs. If present, right click,
choose Modify, and enter the path to your mail program, e.g.,
"${LOCALBASE}/bin/thunderbird" or "${LOCALBASE}/bin/kmail" (other
programs may work, but these two have been tested).  If absent,
right click, choose New String. Set the name to
"network.protocol-handler.app.mailto" and the value to the path to
your mailer.

Plugins
=======
Firefox looks for plugins in ~/.mozilla/plugins and
${TRUEPREFIX}/lib/mozilla/plugins.
If the environment variable MOZ_PLUGIN_PATH is specified, this
location will be overridden.

Debugging
=========
If you encounter crashes, you might want to build the debug FLAVOR of
this package, and run firefox inside gdb, so that you can gather
debugging logs and traces (for all threads!).
Bug reports without that information will be ignored.

HTML5 audio/video support
=========================
For a full multimedia experience, such as playing MP3 audio or MPEG
videos, install the "ffmpeg" package. It will be used at runtime if
firefox finds it.

# pkg_add ffmpeg

KerberosV support
=================
To use Kerberized Firefox, first manually install the "heimdal" package
and configure the Kerberos client.

Firefox will load the libraries at runtime if required. On OpenBSD, they
are installed in a non-standard location; to allow Firefox to find them,
either set LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${LOCALBASE}/heimdal/lib in your environment
(possibly via a shell alias or wrapper script if you only want to
set this for Firefox), or modify 'shlib_dirs' in /etc/rc.conf.local.

To instruct Firefox to use Kerberos for specific domains, open
'about:config' and modify the following key:

network.negotiate-auth.trusted-uris: .example.com

Multi-processus (e10s)
======================
Firefox has a multi-processus feature (https://wiki.mozilla.org/Electrolysis),
currently not enabled by default as of 49, but if you want to test/enable it
you can:
- create a new about:config pref named browser.tabs.remote.force-enable
  and set it to true
- set browser.tabs.remote.autostart to true

Restart the browser, and check about:support - it should say '1/1 (Enabled by
user)' next to 'Multiprocess Windows'.

@Update to firefox 49.0.1.

See https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/49.0/releasenotes/ (.1 is for
a windows-only fix) - not that 'loop' (ex-firefox hello) was removed
from the browser.
- Fixes MFSA 2016-85
- Remove media/ffvpx/config.h patch, merged upstream/fixed differently in
bug #1239550
- Set media.autoplay.enabled to false by default, i'm usually wary of
  changing upstream defaults, but this one is unfuriating with "the
modern web and all this funky video ads".. this one got support from
many.
- Add a blurb to README explaining how to enable/test e10s/multi-process
  support.

@Update to firefox 46.0.

- See https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/46.0/releasenotes/
- Fixes MFSA 2016-39 -> 48
- Switch to use Gtk3 by default (finally!), following the upstream move
- Add a jumbo patch from Fedora to fix several issues with Gtk 3.20
  (#1234158)
- Leave WebRTC enabled. The code builds, sort-of works, sound support
  is not really there, but this way ppl will dogfood/test it. If you
  encounter issues, go to bugzilla.mozilla.org and get involved with
  upstream.
- If you want to disable WebRTC, just toggle media.peerconnection.enabled
  to false in about:config.
- Stop using systemwide sqlite, build the bundled one instead. Simpler,
  as it often forced us to update sqlite in base...
- Add patch from #1239550 to fix the build in ffvpx
- Backport two cubeb patches from ratchov@@ already commited upstream
  (#1153151 & #1153179)
- Remove the obsolete gstreamer section from README, from Brad (and others)

Due to dependencies reasons, you have to manually install some

@Update to firefox 35.0.1.

- See https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/35.0.1/releasenotes/
- while here, demote gstreamer1-plugins-good from RUN_DEPENDS to a
  simple note in the README. It seems having a fully working
out-of-the-box multimedia experience is not worth the attack surface
this brings via all its dependencies.

Note: this doesnt change anything for existing installs, if
gstreamer1-plugins-good/libav is found at runtime firefox will still use
it to play html audio/video. If you dont want that behaviour, have a
look in about:config for the various media.*.enabled keys. Or use lynx.

Enabling ECC cipher suites
==========================
Open the URL about:config and type security.ssl3 in the search
filter. This will bring up a list of all available cipher suites.
Double-click on any cipher to toggle its state. For example, to
enable TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA, double-click on
security.ssl3.ecdhe_ecdsa_aes128_sha until its boolean entry in the
Value column changes to true.

Using Java Applets

To make Applets work, you must symlink (not copy) the file
libjavaplugin_oji.so into one of the directories listed above.
This might be done like the following:

$ cd ~/.mozilla/plugins
$ ln -s ${LOCALBASE}/jdk-1.5.0/jre/plugin/i386/ns7/libjavaplugin_oji.so .
$
