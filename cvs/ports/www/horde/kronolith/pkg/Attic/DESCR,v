@Unhook www/horde - these ports are for Horde 3 which is EOL and doesn't work
well with current PHP versions - Horde 5 is maintained upstream but it's split
in 132 pieces which doesn't really fit well with ports, especially as it's
strongly advised to be installed from their PEAR server. For more information,
see http://www.horde.org/apps/groupware/docs/INSTALL

@Kronolith is the Horde calendar application. It provides a stable and
featureful individual calendar system for every Horde user, with integrated
collaboration/scheduling features. It makes extensive use of the Horde
Framework to provide integration with other applications.

Right now, Kronolith implements a solid, stand-alone calendar system,
allowing repeating events, all-day events, custom fields, keywords, shared
calendars, iCalendar support, generation of free/busy information, and
managing multiple users through Horde Authentication. The calendar API that
Kronolith uses is abstracted; available backends include MySQL, PostgreSQL,
Oracle, MSSQL, MCAL and Kolab.

To complete the installation, be sure that Horde and IMP are configured
and working first, then see ${PREFIX}/${INSTDIR}/docs/INSTALL

@Import the various Horde components (horde, imp, ingo, kronolith, etc)

horde.port.mk. Update components to current versions while there.
