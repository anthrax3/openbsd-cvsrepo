log
@Unhook www/horde - these ports are for Horde 3 which is EOL and doesn't work
well with current PHP versions - Horde 5 is maintained upstream but it's split
in 132 pieces which doesn't really fit well with ports, especially as it's
strongly advised to be installed from their PEAR server. For more information,
see http://www.horde.org/apps/groupware/docs/INSTALL

Chora is a tool for viewing code repositories that are managed
using the CVS or Subversion source control systems. It aims to
provide a high degree of integration with CVS, SVN and the other
Horde web-based tools.
