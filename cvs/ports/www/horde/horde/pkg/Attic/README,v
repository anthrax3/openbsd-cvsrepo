log
@Unhook www/horde - these ports are for Horde 3 which is EOL and doesn't work
well with current PHP versions - Horde 5 is maintained upstream but it's split
in 132 pieces which doesn't really fit well with ports, especially as it's
strongly advised to be installed from their PEAR server. For more information,
see http://www.horde.org/apps/groupware/docs/INSTALL

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------
| Running ${FULLPKGNAME} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The Horde application framework has been installed into ${PREFIX}/${INSTDIR}.
Configure a new virtual host to serve the documents from here, or symlink
it into the DocumentRoot of your web-server, e.g.

   # ln -s ../horde /var/www/htdocs/horde

Ensure that the required PHP extensions are activated (with symlinks
in /etc/php-${MODPHP_VERSION} pointing to the sample files in php-${MODPHP_VERSION}.sample,
as directed by the installation messages for the PHP extensions)
and that the web server has been restarted.

Then follow the steps in the Configuring Horde and Securing Horde
sections of ${PREFIX}/${INSTDIR}/docs/INSTALL and ensure that you have a
working installation by accessing http://<localhost>/horde/test.php.
Now you can configure Horde-based applications (IMP, etc) by following
their individual guide in ${PREFIX}/${INSTDIR}/<module>/docs/INSTALL.
