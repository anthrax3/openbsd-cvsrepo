@Unhook www/horde - these ports are for Horde 3 which is EOL and doesn't work
well with current PHP versions - Horde 5 is maintained upstream but it's split
in 132 pieces which doesn't really fit well with ports, especially as it's
strongly advised to be installed from their PEAR server. For more information,
see http://www.horde.org/apps/groupware/docs/INSTALL

@The Horde Project is a group of developers who write Web applications
using the Horde Application Framework, itself a product of the
Project.

The Horde Application Framework is written in PHP, and provides the
common tools a Web application requires: classes for dealing with
preferences, compression, browser detection, connection tracking,
MIME, and more.
