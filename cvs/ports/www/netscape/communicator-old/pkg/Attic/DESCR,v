@Netscape Communicator 4.61, Fortified
-------------------------------------

Release notes for this version of Netscape are available on-line.  After
starting the program, select "Release Notes" from the "Help" menu.  This
will take you to the URL

    http://home.netscape.com/eng/mozilla/4.61/relnotes/unix-4.61.html

which lists new features and known problems of this release.

This version of Netscape has been modified for OpenBSD using Fortify,
a program that provides world-wide, unconditional, full strength
128-bit cryptography to export-crippled Netscape browsers.

SPARC NOTICE
------------
Use of this port requires a kernel compiled with 'option COMPAT_SUNOS'

@- upgrade BSD/OS binary to 4.75 of Netscape Communicator/Navigator
- remove the SunOS binary, unfortunately Netscape has dropped support for
SunOS and this old binary has quite a few security issues. I don't see it
fit to be included in the tree anymore at any cost.

1.1.1.1
log
@Reformatted netscape ports, to allow easier sharing of configuration
between navigator and communicator, plus distinct versions depending on
the architecture.

Fix a few problems while I'm doing it:
- remove uncaught bison build dependency,
- sort PLIST,
- mark navigator and communicator as conflicting.

Not linked in www yet, waiting for sparc tests.
