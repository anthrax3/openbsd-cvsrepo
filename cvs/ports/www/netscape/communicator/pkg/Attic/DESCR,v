@- upgrade BSD/OS binary to 4.75 of Netscape Communicator/Navigator
- remove the SunOS binary, unfortunately Netscape has dropped support for
SunOS and this old binary has quite a few security issues. I don't see it
fit to be included in the tree anymore at any cost.

1.1.1.1
log
@Reformatted netscape ports, to allow easier sharing of configuration
between navigator and communicator, plus distinct versions depending on
the architecture.

Fix a few problems while I'm doing it:
- remove uncaught bison build dependency,
- sort PLIST,
- mark navigator and communicator as conflicting.

Not linked in www yet, waiting for sparc tests.
