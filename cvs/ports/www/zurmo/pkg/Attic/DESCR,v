@Zurmo is an open source CRM  application written in PHP utilizing
jQuery, Yii Framework, and RedBeanPHP.

The goal with Zurmo is to provide an easy-to-use, easy-to-customize CRM
application that can be adapted to any business use case. 
Special care has been taken to think through many different use cases
with a system designed to provide a high degree of flexibility, covering

Zurmo doesn't have a million features.
But considering companies wind up only using a handful of them, it does
not really matter.
