@Currently Squid 3.5 is considered stable. Rather than moving snapshot/*
to stable/*, just drop back to a single version of squid in ports.

1.1
log
@Update to squid-3.3.10 and reorganise the squid ports; retire squid-2.7
(it was kept separately because 3.x didn't build on some arch due to an
incomplete atomic ops autoconf check which has since been repaired) and
replace with 3.4 (devel version). Enable additional helpers and turn on
support for rock cache dirs.

1.1.10.1
log
@Backport from -current: update to squid-3.5.9, fixes problems with
TLS/SSL parsing in configurations using SSL-Bump.

- int overflow with extension parsing: char << 8 into a short
http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v3/3.5/changesets/squid-3.5-13915.patch

- {Client,Server}Hello parsing; when checking for TLS extensions, don't
check for bytes following compression_method in the _whole_ message, only
in the *Hello part ("does not account for the fact that the message may
contain more than just ServerHello").
