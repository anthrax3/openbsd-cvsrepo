@update squid/stable to 3.4.5 and squid/snapshot to 20140506-r13398.
use ports/lang/gcc to build snapshot, squid will be moving to requiring
c++11 so let's build this with it already to get more experience.
squid/stable stays with base gcc for most arch for now.

log
@Update to squid-3.3.10 and reorganise the squid ports; retire squid-2.7
(it was kept separately because 3.x didn't build on some arch due to an
incomplete atomic ops autoconf check which has since been repaired) and
replace with 3.4 (devel version). Enable additional helpers and turn on
support for rock cache dirs.
