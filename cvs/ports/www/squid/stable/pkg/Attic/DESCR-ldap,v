1.2
log
@Currently Squid 3.5 is considered stable. Rather than moving snapshot/*
to stable/*, just drop back to a single version of squid in ports.

@This package provides LDAP authentication and ACL helpers for Squid.

1.1
log
@Update to squid-3.3.10 and reorganise the squid ports; retire squid-2.7
(it was kept separately because 3.x didn't build on some arch due to an
incomplete atomic ops autoconf check which has since been repaired) and
replace with 3.4 (devel version). Enable additional helpers and turn on
support for rock cache dirs.
