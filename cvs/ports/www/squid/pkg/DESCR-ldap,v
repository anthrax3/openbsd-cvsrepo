@Currently Squid 3.5 is considered stable. Rather than moving snapshot/*
to stable/*, just drop back to a single version of squid in ports.

@This package provides LDAP authentication and ACL helpers for Squid.

@Update to Squid 3.2.3.

This is merged from work by myself and Matthias Pitzl @@ genua, thanks to
Rodolfo Gouveia for testing with NTLM.

Flavours have been removed:

- the external helper programs for NTLM/LDAP are now in subpackages:
squid-ldap and squid-ntlm.

- SNMP support is built by default in Squid 3.x so this has moved
to the main package (no external dependencies for this).
