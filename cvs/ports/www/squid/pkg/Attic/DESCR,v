@Update to Squid 3.2.3.

This is merged from work by myself and Matthias Pitzl @@ genua, thanks to
Rodolfo Gouveia for testing with NTLM.

Flavours have been removed:

- the external helper programs for NTLM/LDAP are now in subpackages:
squid-ldap and squid-ntlm.

- SNMP support is built by default in Squid 3.x so this has moved
to the main package (no external dependencies for this).
@
text
@Squid is a high-performance proxy caching server for web clients,
supporting FTP, gopher, and HTTP data objects. Unlike traditional caching
software, Squid handles all requests in a single, non-blocking, I/O-driven
process.

Squid keeps meta data and especially hot objects cached in RAM, caches DNS
lookups, supports non-blocking DNS lookups, and implements negative
caching of failed requests.

Squid supports SSL, extensive access controls, and full request logging.
By using the lightweight Internet Cache Protocol, Squid caches can be
arranged in a hierarchy or mesh for additional bandwidth savings.

Flavors:
	ldap - Support for LDAP
	ntlm - Support for NTLM
	snmp - Support for SNMP
