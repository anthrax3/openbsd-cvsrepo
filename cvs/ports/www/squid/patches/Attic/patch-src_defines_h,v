@Update to Squid 3.2.3.

This is merged from work by myself and Matthias Pitzl @@ genua, thanks to
Rodolfo Gouveia for testing with NTLM.

Flavours have been removed:

- the external helper programs for NTLM/LDAP are now in subpackages:
squid-ldap and squid-ntlm.

- SNMP support is built by default in Squid 3.x so this has moved
to the main package (no external dependencies for this).
