1.2
log
@m4 eval.c r1.67 fixed the HAVE_VOID__ problem which was causing
trouble for autoconf 2.62+; remove this workaround which now causes
the build to fail. No bump as the package doesn't change from the
version which last built successfully.

Build failure noticed by naddy@@. 'make it so' jasper@@, Brad ok.
