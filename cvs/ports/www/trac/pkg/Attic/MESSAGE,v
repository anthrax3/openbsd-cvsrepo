@- move docs from MESSAGE to README

- drop mandatory deps on enscript and clearsilver; both are supported
but optional. (note, clearsilver support will be going away in trac 0.13).

@To configure a Trac environment, you must run the following command
and follow the prompts:
    trac-admin </path/to/projectenv> initenv

Here, "</path/to/projectenv>" is the location on your disk where you
want to place the project environment.

"</path/to/projectenv/conf/trac.ini>" is the configuration file of your
project environment which allows to setup the name of the project, etc.

To get started with Trac, you can use the built-in webserver, by running:
   tracd -p 8085 </path/to/projectenv>

Now you can open up a web brower and go to http://localhost:8085/. You
should see a single link for the project you just created. If you follow
the link, you should see trac in action.

You can find the Trac Installation and Upgrade Guides here:
  http://projects.edgewall.com/trac/wiki/TracInstall

If updating from trac-0.10.4p1 or older, you must update trac's 
database from sqlite2 to sqlite3. You do this by going to the 
db-directory of trac and running the following commands:

mv trac.db trac.db.old
${LOCALBASE}/bin/sqlite trac.db.old .dump | ${LOCALBASE}/bin/sqlite3 trac.db

@- initial import of trac 0.9.4 submitted by Ben Lovett

Trac is an enhanced wiki and issue tracking system for software development
projects. Trac uses a minimalistic approach to web-based software project
management. Our mission; to help developers write great software while
staying out of the way. Trac should impose as little as possible on a
team's established development process and policies.

It provides an interface to Subversion, an integrated Wiki and convenient
report facilities.
