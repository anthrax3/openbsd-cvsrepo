- update to a recent snapshot
- don't hardcode /usr/local in ${FILESDIR}/minimo
- some patches from mozilla don't apply anymore, need to doublecheck them:
	patch-gfx_src_gtk_nsDeviceContextSpecG_cpp 
	patch-nsprpub_pr_src_io_prprf_c

- make sure gnomevfs isn't needed
- ~/.Minimo -> ~/.minimo maybe
- install method could use some tweaks -- make clean needs to be done as root

@minimo-20050524, mini mozilla

this is smaller than firefox and has special handling for small screens
which is useful for machines like the zaurus.  unfortunately, it's not
there yet, see the TODO.  please don't add this to the www Makefile yet.
