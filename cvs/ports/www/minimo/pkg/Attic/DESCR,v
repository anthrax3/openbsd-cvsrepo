@Minimo 1.8.1.19 was released >2 years ago, its codebase is ffx-2.x,
unmaintained upstream, etc. Another mozilla port bites the dust.
(i'll port its descendant fennec once ffx4 works, if it works someday..)

no objections from zaurus/arm users (sthen, kili, deraadt, todd...)
agreed by stephan@@ & steven@@ at trofea

@The Minimo (Mini Mozilla) project is focused on code-size and runtime
footprint reduction, and porting to small consumer devices.  The primary
focus of Minimo to date has been systems with around 32-64 MB of RAM.

FLAVORs:
	debug - build with options suitable for debugging

@minimo-20050524, mini mozilla

this is smaller than firefox and has special handling for small screens
which is useful for machines like the zaurus.  unfortunately, it's not
there yet, see the TODO.  please don't add this to the www Makefile yet.
