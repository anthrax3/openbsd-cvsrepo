1.2

@Remove the following webapps:
- ezpublish, no maintainer, last updated 2009/08/24
- mantis, no maintainer, out of date
- phplist, very outdated and no-one maintains it
- phpmemcachedadmin, port only extract the distfile and that's it
- vtigercrm, port only extract the distfile and that's it

While we do this in a case-by-case basis, this was done for one of the
following reasons:
* do not give user a sense of security because there is a pkg available
when it is in fact outdated/unmaintained and including possible security
issues
* package with no added value besides extracting the distfile under
/var/www are pretty useless -- they demand an effort to be kept up to
date for no benefits (except if someone actually maintains it of course)
* some webapps must complete a strict version update path -- eg.
updating from 1.0 to 1.5 requires updating to 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 and 1.4
first -- that does not work well with pkg

ok Wen Heping (MAINTAINER of vtigercrm)

PS: no we are not in a rampage to remove lots of www apps -- just some when
it makes sense

This program allows to see in real-time (top-like) or from the start of
the server, stats for get, set, delete, increment, decrement, evictions,
reclaimed, cas command, as well as server stats (network, items, server
version) with googlecharts and server internal configuration. You can go
further to see each server slabs, occupation, memory wasted and items (key
& value). Another part can execute commands on any memcached server: get,
set, delete, flush_all, as well as execute any commands (like stats) with
telnet.
