Our nm doesn't support neither '-D' nor '-f', hence some non-critical
errors occur during chromium and iridium builds:

Fix these errors by using llvm-nm instead.

While here, also fix a typo into iridium's pkg/DESCR (missing verb).

@import of iridium-41.2:

Iridium is a free, open, and libre browser modification of the Chromium code base,
with privacy being enhanced in several key areas.
Automatic transmission of partial queries, keywords, metrics to central services
inhibited and only occurs with consent.
In addition, all our builds are reproducible, and modifications are auditable,
setting the project ahead of other secure browser providers.
