@Finally fix www/kazehakase, after lots of cries and pain with/about
libtool. Backport upstream svn r3779 + r3872 to correctly build with
xulrunner 1.9.2, and use ports libtool which does a way better job at
linking gecko.so than gnu libtool. This needs r1.120 of build/libtool.

@WIP on unbreaking kazehakase:
- update to 0.5.8
- backport upstream svn r3871 to let it build with latest gtk+2
- switch to xulrunner 1.9.x (breaks gecko backend while here)
- don't try to create a dbus server socket in a non-existent dir
It is still badly broken, as upstream doesn't seem to care about
shipping working stuff... but at least it builds and packages.

log
@Update kazehakase to the just-released 0.5.6.
Now that we have www/webkit in ports, split it into MULTI_PACKAGES :
-main has the common infrastructure files (and the binary), -gecko provides
gecko engine support, -webkit provides webkit engine support.

To ease updates, -gecko has the same pkgname as previous package. -webkit
support is still a bit experimental, and provided for webdevelopers who
want to write and test cross-engine websites.

With help and ok ajacoutot@@
