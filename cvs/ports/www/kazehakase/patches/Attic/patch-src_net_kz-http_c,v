1.1
log
@WIP on unbreaking kazehakase:
- update to 0.5.8
- backport upstream svn r3871 to let it build with latest gtk+2
- switch to xulrunner 1.9.x (breaks gecko backend while here)
- don't try to create a dbus server socket in a non-existent dir
It is still badly broken, as upstream doesn't seem to care about
shipping working stuff... but at least it builds and packages.
