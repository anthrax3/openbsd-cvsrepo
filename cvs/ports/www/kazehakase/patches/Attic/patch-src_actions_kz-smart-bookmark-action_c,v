@WIP on unbreaking kazehakase:
- update to 0.5.8
- backport upstream svn r3871 to let it build with latest gtk+2
- switch to xulrunner 1.9.x (breaks gecko backend while here)
- don't try to create a dbus server socket in a non-existent dir
It is still badly broken, as upstream doesn't seem to care about
shipping working stuff... but at least it builds and packages.

@Sigh.. since upstream doesn't care about providing tarballs that
compile, nor instructions on how to compile it, we can't update to
0.5.8, but at least we can backport gtk-entry code and callers from it.
This is ugly^Whackish^Whorrible, but at least it really works again.
While here, drop MAINTAINERship, i don't want to be responsible for that
pile of crap anymore.
