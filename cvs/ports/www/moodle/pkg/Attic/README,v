@Remove www/moodle, ok ajacoutot.

The port isn't maintained and rather out-of-date, it doesn't add much
value by way of easy installation instructions, and additionally if we
were to update to a current version, the upgrade procedure requires
going through an intermediate version. As such, users are advised to
install through standard distfiles instead.

| Running ${FULLPKGNAME} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The moodle has been installed into ${INSTDIR}

You should point this to the DocumentRoot of your web-server:
   # ln -s ../moodle /var/www/htdocs/moodle
(make sure you use a relative symlink since Apache is chrooted)

You can ensure you have a working install by accessing:
http://<localhost>/moodle/
