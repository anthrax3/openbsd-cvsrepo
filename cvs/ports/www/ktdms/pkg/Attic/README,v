@Remove knowledgetree which did not get any update for about 6 years.
There is an updated release which is 4 years old which source is not
easily fetchable, does not work well in chroot... and the only supported
way of fully running that stuff is using the commercial version on linux.

"of course" ok robert@@

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------
| Running ${FULLPKGNAME} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

To finish the installation of KnowledgeTree, setup a database.
In order to create the dms database issue the following command,
on your database server:

  # mysqladmin -p create dms

Then you have to create and populate the tables by issuing the
following commands on the same database server:

  # mysql -p dms < ${INSTDIR}/ktdms/sql/mysql/install/structure.sql
  # mysql -p dms < ${INSTDIR}/ktdms/sql/mysql/install/data.sql

Please adjust the %%INSTDIR%%/ktdms/config/config.ini file to your
needs. This file also cointains the default username and password
for the dms database.

Note: A default Admin user with username admin and password admin
is set up during the database setup.
The default admin user login allows initial access to KnowledgeTree.
This initial login has no relation to the two MySQL accounts in the 
${INSTDIR}/ktdms/config/config.ini file.

Chroot instructions
===================

In order to make ktdms operate in a chroot environment, it is
necessary to copy all of the relevant tools, libraries, that
ktdms employs into /var/www. 

First, create the basic directory structure:

$ cd /var/www
# mkdir {tmp,usr}
# chown www:www tmp	(needs to be writeable for the www user)

$ cd /var/www/usr
# mkdir -p {bin,lib,libexec,local}

$ cd /var/www/usr/local
# mkdir -p bin 

Now, the required binaries:

$ cd /var/www/bin
# cp -p /bin/df .

$ cd /var/www/usr/local/bin
# cp -p /usr/local/bin/{zip,unzip,catdoc,catpps,xls2csv} .

Next, the libraries that the binaries are linked to:

NOTE: Wildcards will, of course, copy any old, unused libraries that are
lurking around (for example, from an upgrade):

$ cd /var/www/usr/lib
# cp -p /usr/lib/lib{c,m}.so* .

Now, the run-time link-editor:

$ cd /var/www/usr/libexec
# cp -p /usr/libexec/ld.so .
