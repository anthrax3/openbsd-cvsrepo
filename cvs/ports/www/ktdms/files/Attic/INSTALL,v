@To finish the installation of KnowledgeTree, setup a database.
In order to create the dms database issue the following command,
on your database server:

  # mysqladmin -p create dms

Then you have to create and populate the tables by issuing the
following commands on the same database server:

  # mysql -p dms < %%INSTDIR%%/ktdms/sql/mysql/install/structure.sql
  # mysql -p dms < %%INSTDIR%%/ktdms/sql/mysql/install/data.sql


Please adjust the %%INSTDIR%%/ktdms/config/config.ini file to your
needs. This file also cointains the default username and password
for the dms database.

Note: A default Admin user with username admin and password admin
is set up during the database setup.
The default admin user login allows initial access to KnowledgeTree.
This initial login has no relation to the two MySQL accounts in the 
%%INSTDIR%%/ktdms/config/config.ini file.

If you are running a chroot'ed apache please read the
%%INSTDIR%%/ktdms/docs/README.chroot file.
