@late update to chromium 9, robert@@ did the work, but he doesn't have the
time right now.
Tree is still locked!
Reasons for the update:
- good work that can be used now
- only builds on i386/amd64, and they're fast
- multiple security problems in old chrome
- old chrome half working, can't break it more than it was.

This one requires resources (see MESSAGE), but it's ways more stable.

Again, discussed with sthen@@, jasper@@, naddy@@, miod@@

@cut the "monster patches" into small pieces. pval can fix it to his liking
if he comes back.
In the mean time, fix build of chromium by adding the required
-I/usr/local/includes to gyp glue where needed.
