@update to the latest stable version which is now 11.0.696.60
+ switch from using system sqlite to the bundled one because they have
  many modifications that are needed
+ add a new mirror for the distfile because the google one is utterly slow

@late update to chromium 9, robert@@ did the work, but he doesn't have the
time right now.
Tree is still locked!
Reasons for the update:
- good work that can be used now
- only builds on i386/amd64, and they're fast
- multiple security problems in old chrome
- old chrome half working, can't break it more than it was.

This one requires resources (see MESSAGE), but it's ways more stable.

Again, discussed with sthen@@, jasper@@, naddy@@, miod@@
