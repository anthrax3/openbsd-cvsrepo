@Move chromium to the new build system (gn - generate ninja)

This commit moves the chromium port to use gn to generate ninja files
which will hopefully resolve the random build errors. Gyp is dead so
this move has to be done anyway.

Also change the way how we handle openbsd. Let's assume we are running
on linux and only handle !linux cases where needed. This also ensures
that a change on linux will for sure end up in our builds as well.

@pledge(2) the chromium processes;

The renderer, gpu, plugin and utility processes are now using pledge(2)
Unfortunately the GPU process only requires an rpath pledge because of
Mesa trying to parse two configuration files, /etc/drirc and ${HOME}/.drirc
So currently the GPU process will use an rpath pledge in the next
week or so so that people can test, but this situation has to be
resolved because it is not acceptable that a mostly unused configuration
file is being parsed from a library and that stops us from using less
pledges and thus disallowing the GPU process to have read access
to the filsystem ... like your ssh keys.
