@Increase limits to minimum working defaults.

@Your default datasize might not be enough for v8 so if you
experience the infamous "Aw, Snap!" error messages try to
raise your datasize limit to a higher value.
To set it to 715M you can do the following:

$ ulimit -d 716800

or modify /etc/login.conf.

And opening lots of tabs may necessitate higher fd limits,
crank that via ulimit/limits.

You may need to crank shared memory limits for chromium to work
properly under load:

# sysctl kern.shminfo.shmall=32768

Your default datasize might not be enough for v8 so make sure it
is more than 512M, so try to set it to 715M by doing:

@late update to chromium 9, robert@@ did the work, but he doesn't have the
time right now.
Tree is still locked!
Reasons for the update:
- good work that can be used now
- only builds on i386/amd64, and they're fast
- multiple security problems in old chrome
- old chrome half working, can't break it more than it was.

This one requires resources (see MESSAGE), but it's ways more stable.

Again, discussed with sthen@@, jasper@@, naddy@@, miod@@

This package currently requires a CPU supporting SSE2.
You can check this with: dmesg | grep 'cpu.*SSE2'

log
@Mention in MESSAGE that this package currently requires SSE2,
and show how to check. This should change sometime, but the
fix is fiddly and for now we should let people know. Committing
now to make sure something is in pre-4.7.

Discussed with pval, this diff ok jasper@@ landry@@

@Initial import of Chromium for OpenBSD, a multi-month effort! :)
i386 and amd64 supported.

Chromium is an open-source browser project that aims
to build a safer, faster, and more stable way for all
Internet users to experience the web. http://www.chromium.org/

This is version 4.0.251.0 with a tarball already including hundreds
of patches by myself, Sprewell, Ben Laurie and others from the original
FreeBSD effort. See homepage for more details and known issue:
http://sightly.net/peter/openbsd/chromium/
(right now, there are i386 & amd64 -current packages there that can
be pkg_add'ed, links to the FreeBSD page for more info, etc)

The patches are being cleaned up and sent upstream in chunks, the
goal will be to have a clean tarball eventually. I _just_ got this
working earlier this week so it may crash and burn (especially on
amd64 as some parts do not appear 64-bit clean), let me know.
