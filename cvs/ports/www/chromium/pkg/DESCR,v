@Initial import of Chromium for OpenBSD, a multi-month effort! :)
i386 and amd64 supported.

Chromium is an open-source browser project that aims
to build a safer, faster, and more stable way for all
Internet users to experience the web. http://www.chromium.org/

This is version 4.0.251.0 with a tarball already including hundreds
of patches by myself, Sprewell, Ben Laurie and others from the original
FreeBSD effort. See homepage for more details and known issue:
http://sightly.net/peter/openbsd/chromium/
(right now, there are i386 & amd64 -current packages there that can
be pkg_add'ed, links to the FreeBSD page for more info, etc)

The patches are being cleaned up and sent upstream in chunks, the
goal will be to have a clean tarball eventually. I _just_ got this
working earlier this week so it may crash and burn (especially on
amd64 as some parts do not appear 64-bit clean), let me know.
