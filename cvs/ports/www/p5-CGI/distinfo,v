@Import www/p5-CGI 4.15

CGI.pm is a stable, complete and mature solution for processing and
preparing HTTP requests and responses. Major features including
processing form submissions, file uploads, reading and writing
cookies, query string generation and manipulation, and processing
and preparing HTTP headers.

CGI.pm performs very well in a vanilla CGI.pm environment and also
comes with built-in support for mod_perl and mod_perl2 as well as
FastCGI.

It has the benefit of having developed and refined over 20 years
with input from dozens of contributors and being deployed on thousands
of websites. CGI.pm was included in the perl distribution from perl
v5.4 to v5.20, however is has now been removed from the perl core...
