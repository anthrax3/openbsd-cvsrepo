sprintf() and strcpy() changed to snprintf() and strlcpy()
respectively in:
actions.c, cgi.c, cgisimple.c, errlog.c, filters.c, 
gateway.c, jcc.c, loadcfg.c, miscutil.c, urlmatch.c

The privoxy daemon should be run as a non-root user.  The
install sets up a _privoxy user and group, installs config
and log files with that user and group, and points the 
user at the way to start the daemon with the user and 
group.

Privoxy is a web proxy with advanced filtering capabilities for protecting
privacy, filtering web page content, managing cookies, controlling access,
and removing ads, banners, pop-ups and other obnoxious Internet junk.
Privoxy has a very flexible configuration and can be customized to suit
individual needs and tastes. Privoxy has application for both stand-alone
systems and multi-user networks.
