@update to privoxy 3.0.24, including crash fixes and security fixes for
CVE-2016-1982 (invalid reads in case of corrupt chunk-encoded content) and
CVE-2016-1983 (invalid reads with empty Host headers).

While there, drop MESSAGE that relates to updating from a <=2011 version
of the port, and use an autoconf version from this century (upstream
doesn't provide a generated script so there is no "right" version).
@
text
@Note for people upgrading from 3.0.16 and before: There is now an rc
script that will start privoxy chrooted to /var/privoxy. Any
configuration files will be copied over automatically, but you need to
make sure that any other directories which are needed by privoxy (e.g.
the log directories) exist relative to the chroot and have proper
privileges for the _privoxy user.

log
@From Pascal Stumpf with input from ajacotout@@:
"this is a small update of privoxy to 3.0.17, plus an rc script making
use of the built-in chroot functionality. For this to work, you need to
change the home of _privoxy to /var/privoxy, the rc script will copy all
necessary files into the chroot.

Also, some additional files and scripts will be installed."

You will need to edit /etc/rc.local as appropriate and add a
section similar to the following so that privoxy is started
automatically:

    if [ -x ${PREFIX}/sbin/privoxy ]; then
            echo -n ' privoxy';
            ${PREFIX}/sbin/privoxy --user _privoxy._privoxy \
                    ${SYSCONFDIR}/privoxy/config
    fi
