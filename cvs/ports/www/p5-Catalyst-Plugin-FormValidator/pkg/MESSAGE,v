@Update www/p5-Catalyst-Plugin-FormValidator to version 0.094.

Using Catalyst::Plugin::FormValidator is not recommended as the module
takes over the global $c->form method, rather than being applicable in
only part of your Catalyst application.  Furthermore,
Data::FormValidator itself is not recommended for use.
