@Remove fluxbb -- the port brings no added value and is not maintained.
Safer to rely on usptream's tarballs directly.

| Running ${FULLPKGNAME} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

FluxBB has been installed into ${INSTDIR}

You should point this to the DocumentRoot of your web server:
   # ln -s ../fluxbb /var/www/htdocs/fluxbb
(make sure you use a relative symlink since Apache is chrooted)

You can ensure you have a working install by accessing:
http://<localhost>/fluxbb/install.php
