@Retire www/firefox35.

You served us well but you're EOL'ed upstream since 18 months, and your
only reason d'etre was the java plugin from jdk 1.6. But those days this
one doesnt receive updates from oracle, and icedtea-web seems to do a
good job at running java crapplets.
Users will be upgraded for free to www/mozilla-firefox !
