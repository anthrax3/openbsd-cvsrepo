@Remove www/ruby-rails and dependencies.  The current version is
out of date and subject to serious security vulnerabilities, updating
it causes a lot of ports churn for little benefit, and nobody has
offered to maintain it.

@Import ruby-rack-mount, one of the dependencies for Rails 3.

Rack::Mount is a stackable dynamic tree based Rack router.  Rack::Mount
supports Rack's +X-Cascade+ convention to continue trying routes if the
response returns pass. This allows multiple routes to be nested or
stacked on top of each other. Since the application endpoint can trigger
the router to continue matching, middleware can be used to add arbitrary
conditions to any route. This allows you to route based on other request
attributes, session information, or even data dynamically pulled from a
database.
