@Import offline browser HTTrack.

HTTrack is an easy-to-use offline browser utility. It allows you to
download a World Wide Web site from the Internet to a local directory,
building recursively all directories, getting HTML, images, and other
files from the server to your computer. HTTrack arranges the original
site's relative link-structure. Simply open a page of the "mirrored"
website in your browser, and you can browse the site from link to link,
as if you were viewing it online. HTTrack can also update an existing
mirrored site, and resume interrupted downloads. HTTrack is fully
configurable, and has an integrated help system.

A lot of feedback from and okay kirby@@
