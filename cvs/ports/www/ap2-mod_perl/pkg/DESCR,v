@Initial revision

@The Apache/Perl integration project brings together the full power of the
Perl programming language and the Apache HTTP server. This is achieved by
linking the Perl runtime library into the server and providing an object
oriented Perl interface to the server's C language API.

These pieces are seamlessly glued together by the `mod_perl' server
plugin, making it is possible to write Apache modules entirely in Perl.
In addition, the persistent interpreter embedded in the server avoids the
overhead of starting an external interpreter program and the additional
Perl start-up (compile) time.

@import of mod_perl 2.0.3 for use on apache 2

this package aims to provide the full power of perl together with the
apache web server version 2. you can use perl to manage apache, respond to
requests for web pages and much more.

there already exists a mod_perl in ports (www/mod_perl) for use with the
apache in the base openbsd system. this one is usable only with
www/apache-httpd. the mod_perl developers were kind enough to set things up
so they wont conflict with each other, so you can have both running
concurrently.

originally from srebrenko sehic, with some naming tweaks from me. lots of
help from robert@@ (as always).

im importing this now so it can be worked on in tree, but not hooking it up
to the bulk builds. there are a few warts that need to be fixed but i hate
sending tarballs around when we have a tree to develop in. its also nice to
have commit messages against changes so you can see why decisions were made
a certain way. after everyone is happy it can be hooked up.
