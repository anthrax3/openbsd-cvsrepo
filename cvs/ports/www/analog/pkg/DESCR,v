text
@This program analyses logfiles in both the common log format and NCSA
old format from WWW servers. It is designed to be fast on long
logfiles and to produce attractive statistics.

It was written by Stephen Turner (sret1@@cam.ac.uk). For more details,
see Readme.html in ${PREFIX}/share/analog.

Fixed buffer overflow.

>SECURITY ADVISORY                                   13th February 2001
>----------------------------------------------------------------------
>Program: analog
>Versions: all versions except 4.16 and 4.90beta3
>Operating systems: all
>----------------------------------------------------------------------
>There is a buffer overflow bug in all versions of analog released
>prior to today. A malicious user could use an ALIAS command to
>construct very long strings which were not checked for length.
>
>This bug is particularly dangerous if the form interface (which allows
>unknown users to run the program via a CGI script) has been installed.
>
>This bug was discovered by the program author, and there is no known
>exploit. However, users are advised to upgrade to one of the two safe
>versions immediately, especially if they have installed the form
>interface. The URL is http://www.analog.cx/
>
>I apologise for the inconvenience.
