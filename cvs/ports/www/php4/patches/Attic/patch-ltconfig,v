1.2
log
@- update to php-4.0.4
- bump NEED_VERSION
- no longer need extra distfile number4.tar.gz since it has
  been integrated into the main distribution
- ltconfig, mysql socket patches are in main distribution now,
  so they are removed.  Note that the ltconfig patch was only
  applied to the 4_0_4 branch by the PHP team, so we will have
  to resubmit it for the next version, unless libtool-cvs has
  been updated with our information.
- Since php3/4 conflict with each other anyway, versioning is
  not needed.
