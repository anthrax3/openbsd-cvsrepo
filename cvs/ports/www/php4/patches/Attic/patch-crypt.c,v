@Upgrade to PHP-4.0.5

- update MASTER_SITES to account for some wierdness on php.net
- all the old patches have been merged into the source tree now
- add a minor patch to improve the randomness of php temporary files

Upgrade is recommended.  Contains a vast array of bugfixes over
previous PHP4 releases (read the NEWS file)

@Add a couple of patches from venaas@@php.net to allow PHP-4.0.4 to work
with OpenSSL 0.9.5a, instead of requiring only OpenSSL 0.9.6
These patches detect the revelant version and use the additional return
values in 0.9.6 only if present.

This also unbreaks the SNMP flavor on 2.8-stable, which requires SSL
support, since our UCD-SNMP daemon has OpenSSL compiled into it
(wierd, but thats how the PHP snmp-config.m4 works)

- Add OpenSSL patches
- Add note crypt.c patch that its now in 4.0.5-dev and can be removed soon
- Add --with-openssl to the standard set of configure options

log
@- update to php-4.0.4
- bump NEED_VERSION
- no longer need extra distfile number4.tar.gz since it has
  been integrated into the main distribution
- ltconfig, mysql socket patches are in main distribution now,
  so they are removed.  Note that the ltconfig patch was only
  applied to the 4_0_4 branch by the PHP team, so we will have
  to resubmit it for the next version, unless libtool-cvs has
  been updated with our information.
- Since php3/4 conflict with each other anyway, versioning is
  not needed.
