@PEAR (PHP Extensions and Add-on Repository) is a code repository
for PHP extensions and PHP library code inspired by TeX's CTAN and
Perl's CPAN.

While it is currently distributed with PHP, it is being dissociated,
and future versions will be upgradable independently of PHP4.

@Import php4-pear-4.2.1

PEAR is a set of class libraries for PHP4 - similar to CPAN.
This module installs the default 4.2.1 modules, and some extra ones
which mysteriously disappeared from the 4.1.2 -> 4.2.1 transition.

Also included are some command-line utilities to add more modules from
the PEAR web site.
