@it's a sunny day....and the right time to kill php4.

it has been unlinked from the builds for some monthts now, and everybody
should've upgraded to php5 a long time ago.

@PEAR (PHP Extensions and Add-on Repository) is a code repository
for PHP extensions and PHP library code inspired by TeX's CTAN and
Perl's CPAN.

While it is currently distributed with PHP, it is being dissociated,
and future versions will be upgradable independently of PHP4.

@upgrade to php4-4.3.2RC4.  this is the final release candidate for
4.3.2, and should be a hell of a lot more stable than 4.3.1, especially
on 64-bit architectures

this commit also merges the pear/ stuff into a subpackage of core;
its no longer necessary to have a separate directory just for the pear libs.
