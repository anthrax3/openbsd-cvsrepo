@At the most basic level, PHP can do anything any other CGI program
can do, such as collect form data, generate dynamic page content,
or send and receive cookies.

PHP also has support for talking to other services using protocols
such as IMAP, SNMP, NNTP, POP3, or even HTTP. You can also open
raw network sockets and interact using other protocols.

This package installs a stand-alone binary which can be used for
command-line scripts, as well as an Apache module.

@Import php4-core-4.2.1

Installs the barebones php4 with only the gettext, iconv and recode
modules compiled in.

All of the other modules have to be installed as shared modules on
top of this.

In addition to the Apache module, this package also includes a php
command-line binary which can be used in shell scripts.  The binary
uses the same /var/www/conf/php.ini file as the Apache module.

There is some non-i386 breakage at the moment (notably macppc).
