@At the most basic level, PHP can do anything any other CGI program
can do, such as collect form data, generate dynamic page content,
or send and receive cookies.

PHP also has support for talking to other services using protocols
such as IMAP, SNMP, NNTP, POP3, or even HTTP. You can also open
raw network sockets and interact using other protocols.

This package installs a stand-alone binary which can be used for
command-line scripts, as well as an Apache module.
