@it's a sunny day....and the right time to kill php4.

it has been unlinked from the builds for some monthts now, and everybody
should've upgraded to php5 a long time ago.

@To finish the install, enable the php4 module with:
    ${PREFIX}/sbin/phpxs -s

To enable parsing of PHP scripts, add the following to
/var/www/conf/httpd.conf:

    AddType application/x-httpd-php .php

Copy the config file below into ${PHP_CONFIG_FILE}
${PREFIX}/share/examples/php4/php.ini-recommended

Don't forget that the default OpenBSD httpd is chrooted
into /var/www by default, so you may need to create support
directories such as /var/www/tmp for PHP to work correctly.
