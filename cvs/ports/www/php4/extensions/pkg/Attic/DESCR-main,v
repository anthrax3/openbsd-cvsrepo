This is a place-holder package to inform you that the PHP port is
now split into small sub-packages, designed to allow you to install
modules independently of the main PHP engine.

For example, to install the IMAP module, just pkg_add the
php-imap-${V}.tgz package and activate it using the
'phpxs' command.

This package contains no files or dependencies and may be
safely uninstalled.
