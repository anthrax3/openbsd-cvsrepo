@

@XML (eXtensible Markup Language) is a data format for structured
document interchange on the Web. It is a standard defined by The
World Wide Web consortium (W3C). Information about XML and related
technologies can be found at http://www.w3.org/XML/.

This PHP extension implements support for James Clark's expat in
PHP. This toolkit lets you parse, but not validate, XML documents.
It supports three source character encodings also provided by PHP:
US-ASCII, ISO-8859-1 and UTF-8. UTF-16 is not supported.

This extension lets you create XML parsers and then define handlers
for different XML events. Each XML parser also has a few parameters
you can adjust.

@Import php4-4.2.1 extensions

This module generates a bunch of php4 extensions as shared modules,
and seperates them out into multiple packages.

End result is that you can pkg_add individual modules now without
getting into the mess of flavors that we've had in the past.
