This is a place-holder package to inform you that the PHP port is
now split into small sub-packages, designed to allow you to install
modules independently of the main PHP engine.

For example, to install the IMAP module, just pkg_add the
php-imap-${V}.tgz package and activate it using the
'phpxs' command.

This package contains no files or dependencies and may be
safely uninstalled.

You can use the image functions in PHP to get the size of JPEG,
GIF, PNG, SWF, TIFF and JPEG2000 images.

By using the GD library, you will also be able to create and
manipulate images.
a11 5
The format of images you are able to manipulate depend on the version
of GD you install, and any other libraries GD might need to access
those image formats. Versions of GD older than gd-1.6 support gif
format images, and do not support png, where versions greater than
gd-1.6 support png, not gif.

@Import php4-4.2.1 extensions

This module generates a bunch of php4 extensions as shared modules,
and seperates them out into multiple packages.

End result is that you can pkg_add individual modules now without
getting into the mess of flavors that we've had in the past.
