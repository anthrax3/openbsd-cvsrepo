@new MULTI_PACKAGES

while here, remove explicit dependency of -examples and -admin packages
on java, since they depend on the main package which already has this dep.
also tighten pkgspec in dependencies to v4/5.

@This package does not install the example webapps, documentation or
admin webapp.  You must supply your own webapps and configuration.

Please read ${PREFIX}/tomcat/README.OpenBSD for information
on running Tomcat on OpenBSD.
