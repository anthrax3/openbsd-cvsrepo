The tomcat package does not install the example webapps and
documentation.  You must supply your own webapps and configuration or
install the tomcat-examples package for the example webapps and
documentation.  Sample config files for the manager webapp can be found
in %%PREFIX%%/share/examples/tomcat.

The tomcat-examples package includes the examples, full documentation
and localhost config file for the and manager webapp.

The packages are structured this way to facilate mantaining a server
which normally would not contain the examples and documentation webapp.

Tomcat on OpenBSD uses the `%%SYSCONFDIR%%/tomcat' directory for its
configuration files. `$CATALINA_BASE' is `%%CATALINA_BASE%%'. All files
contained within these directories should be owned by the _tomcat user.

The startup.sh script has been modified to get important environment
variables from `%%SYSCONFDIR%%/tomcat/tomcat.rc'. You should define
environment variables such as JAVA_HOME and JAVA_OPTS in
`%%SYSCONFDIR%%/tomcat/tomcat.rc'.

With the following command Tomcat is started as user `_tomcat':
$ sudo -u _tomcat %%PREFIX%%/tomcat/bin/startup.sh

If you want Tomcat to serve on privileged ports (e.g. 80), then makes
sure the Connector port is 80 in your
`%%SYSCONFDIR%%/tomcat/server.xml', or even more secure: redirect all
tcp traffic to port 80 to Tomcat's default listener port 8080 using a
pf.conf(5) rule like:

   rdr on $NIC proto tcp from any to any port 80 -> 127.0.0.1 port 8080

If you are upgrading and use database drivers, don't forget to copy them
into %%PREFIX%%/tomcat/lib. You must also delete any work files in
`%%CATALINA_BASE%%/work' unless you are reinstalling the same full
version of Tomcat. When upgrading from older major versions of Tomcat,
config files in /etc/tomcat should be updated as well.
