@Drop the old horde ports, new versions are now in ports/www/horde
which is also linked to the build with this commit.

@Kronolith is the Horde calendar application. It provides a stable and
featureful individual calendar system for every Horde user, with integrated
collaboration/scheduling features. It makes extensive use of the Horde
Framework to provide integration with other applications.

Right now, Kronolith implements a solid, stand-alone calendar system,
allowing repeating events, all-day events, custom fields, keywords, shared
calendars, iCalendar support, generation of free/busy information, and
managing multiple users through Horde Authentication. The calendar API that
Kronolith uses is abstracted such that it could work with any backend, but
right now we provide SQL (abstracted to support most databases, including
MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and MSSQL via PEAR DB), MCAL, and Kolab backend
libraries.
