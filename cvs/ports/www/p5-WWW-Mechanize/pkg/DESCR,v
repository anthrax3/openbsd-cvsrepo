@WWW::Mechanize, or Mech for short, is a Perl module for stateful
programmatic web browsing, used for automating interaction with
websites.  It supports performing a sequence of page fetches including
following links and submitting forms.  Each fetched page is parsed
and its links and forms are extracted.  A link or a form can be
selected, form fields can be filled and the next page can be fetched.
Mech also stores a history of the URLs you've visited, which can
be queried and revisited.
