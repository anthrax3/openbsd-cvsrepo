@remove cms-ms and concrete5,

having this as a port has no additional value as pkg_add is just a
glorified way of extracting the distfile in the right location.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------
| Running ${FULLPKGNAME} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

CMS Made Simple has been installed into ${INSTDIR}

You should point this to the DocumentRoot of your web-server:
   # ln -s ../cms /var/www/htdocs/cms
(make sure you use a relative symlink since Apache is chrooted)

You will also need to add these lines to you php.ini file:
    extension=mysql.so
    extension=gd.so

and proceed to complete the installation by reading the INSTALL.txt
which has been installed as ${INSTDIR}/doc/INSTALL.txt, starting from
step 2.

You can ensure you have a working install by accessing:
http://<localhost>/cms/
