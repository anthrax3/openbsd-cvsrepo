@Major and security update to 4.6.4
fixes PMASA from PMASA-2016-30 to PMASA-2016-56

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------
| Running ${FULLPKGNAME} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

phpMyAdmin has been installed into ${INSTDIR}.

If using Apache, you can make this accessible to clients by enabling
the configuration file:

    # ln -s ../modules.sample/phpmyadmin.conf /var/www/conf/modules/
    # /etc/rc.d/apache2 restart

By default, this sets an alias for /phpMyAdmin and restricts access
to connections coming from localhost.
It also restricts access from search engine bots.

If you need to allow wider access, after considering security
implications, edit ${VARBASE}/www/conf/modules.sample/phpmyadmin.conf
and restart Apache.

You can check that you have a working installation by accessing:
http://localhost/phpMyAdmin/index.php

SECURITY WARNING
================
Be aware that phpMyAdmin is a frequently attacked target due to a
history of security problems.  You are advised to restrict access to
trusted workstations or access it on localhost via an SSH tunnel.

@various tweaks to phpMyAdmin packaging.
feedback/OKs from aja@@ william@@ jasper@@ giovanni@@ kevlo@@

- move MESSAGE to README.

- add missing dep on php-mysqli.

- change the unpack/fake-install method to use the standard
extract infrastructure.

- @@sample contrib/htaccess into .htaccess so apache can use it by
default if allowoverride is enabled. this does some basic user-agent
checks to reduce the risk of phpmyadmin sites showing up in
search engines.

- provide an @@sample'd apache config file which enables use of
the .htaccess file and restricts access to localhost. talk about
this in README so people know what's going on. (phpMyAdmin has
a history of security-related bugs, but because it's rather
commonly used it's much better to have it in ports so that
it can be updated easily; these changes make the default
installation safer).

to connections coming from localhost.  It also uses AllowOverride to
enable an .htaccess file restricting access from search engine bots.
(The previously recommended method of adding a symlink under htdocs/ 
is not compatible with <Directory> overrides).
