@various tweaks to phpMyAdmin packaging.
feedback/OKs from aja@@ william@@ jasper@@ giovanni@@ kevlo@@

- move MESSAGE to README.

- add missing dep on php-mysqli.

- change the unpack/fake-install method to use the standard
extract infrastructure.

- @@sample contrib/htaccess into .htaccess so apache can use it by
default if allowoverride is enabled. this does some basic user-agent
checks to reduce the risk of phpmyadmin sites showing up in
search engines.

- provide an @@sample'd apache config file which enables use of
the .htaccess file and restricts access to localhost. talk about
this in README so people know what's going on. (phpMyAdmin has
a history of security-related bugs, but because it's rather
commonly used it's much better to have it in ports so that
it can be updated easily; these changes make the default
installation safer).

@The phpMyAdmin has been installed into ${INSTDIR}

You should point this to the DocumentRoot of your web-server:
   # ln -s ../phpMyAdmin /var/www/htdocs/phpMyAdmin
(make sure you use a relative symlink since Apache is chrooted)

You can ensure you have a working install by accessing:
http://<localhost>/phpMyAdmin/index.php
