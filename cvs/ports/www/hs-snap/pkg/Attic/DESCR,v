@Remove hs-snap & friends to also get rid of some then unused
dependencies (which will follow tomorrow). It's better to build and
update frameworks like snap with cabal (from the cabal-install
package) and eventually to keep only those hs-ports which are
required for end user tools like darcs, xmonad, hpodder etc.
