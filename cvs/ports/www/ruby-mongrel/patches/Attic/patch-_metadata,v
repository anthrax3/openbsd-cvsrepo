@Remove mongrel.  This was the first decent ruby webserver, but it's only
built for ruby 1.8.  Any remaining users should switch to unicorn, which
is derived from mongrel.

1.1
log
@REVISION bumps for most ruby ports after the ruby.port.mk update.

PKG_ARCH = * removed from many ports as it is added automatically
for pure ruby gem ports.  Switch ports that previously used
GEM_SKIPDEPENDS to adding dependencies or modifying the underlying
gem metadata with patches.
