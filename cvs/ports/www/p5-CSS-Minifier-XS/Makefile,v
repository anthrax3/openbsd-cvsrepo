@Import www/p5-CSS-Minifier-XS.


CSS::Minifier::XS is a CSS "minifier"; its designed to remove un-necessary
whitespace and comments from CSS files, while also not breaking the CSS.

CSS::Minifier::XS is similar in function to CSS::Minifier, but is substantially
faster as its written in XS and not just pure Perl.


OK and input from sthen@@, also OK benoit@@, robert@@
