@Ok so after a quick chat with sthen@@, rm both xinha and bricolage (which

rm all the things! sthen@@

@Before you start setting up bricolage, be sure to set up your postgresql
server and enable mod_perl.

For instructions on how to complete the installation or upgrade from an
older version of bricolage, see ${PREFIX}/share/doc/bricolage/INSTALL.

The section "Bricolage (Manual Installation)" describes the steps
necessary for initial setup. "UPGRADING" describes how to upgrade from an
older version of bricolage.
