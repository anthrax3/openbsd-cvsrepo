@Ok so after a quick chat with sthen@@, rm both xinha and bricolage (which
is super outdated -- imported in 2006, updated once since then, pretty
sure nobody uses it).

rm all the things! sthen@@

# Required programs.  PG_CONFIG_PATH is the location of PostgreSQL's pg_config 
# script.  APACHE_PATH is the path to the Apache 1.3 executable.  APACHE_EXE is
# the filename of the executable itself.  EXPAT_PATH is the path to the Expat 
# library libexpat.so (also looks in library paths that Perl knows about), and
# EXPAT_FILE is the filename of the library.

# the Apache process will run as.  APACHE_PORT is the port that Apache will
# listen on.  APACHE_SSL_PORT is the port that will listen for https requests.
# APACHE_HOSTNAME is the server's hostname; only set this if you want to 
# override the value returned by the "hostname" command.

# PostgreSQL settings.  POSTGRES_SUPERUSER is the username of the Postgres
# superuser (typically "postgres").  POSTGRES_BRICUSER is the username that 
# Bricolage will use when connecting to the database.  This can be anything 
# you want, but "bric" is typical. POSTGRES_DB is the name of the database 
# Bricolage will use.
#
# In most installations, Postgres allows local users to access the
# server without a username.  If your server requires a password, pass the
# POSTGRES_SUPERPASS environment variable during "make," e.g.:
#
#    make POSTGRES_SUPERPASS=abcdef
#
# The Bricolage Postgres Password (the password used by Bricolage to
# connect to the database) is randomly generated during a silent install.  If
# you need it, it'll be in bricolage.conf after installation.
#
# If PostgreSQL is running on a separate box, you must pass a host name or 
# IP address to "make" through the POSTGRES_HOSTNAME environment variable.
# If it's running on a port other than the default port (5432), pass the 
# appropriate port number with POSTGRES_HOSTPORT.
