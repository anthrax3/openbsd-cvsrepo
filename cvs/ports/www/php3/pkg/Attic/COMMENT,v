@At the most basic level, PHP can do anything any other CGI program can
do, such as collect form data, generate dynamic page content, or send
and receive cookies.

PHP also has support for talking to other services using protocols
such as IMAP, SNMP, NNTP, POP3, or even HTTP. You can also open raw
network sockets and interact using other protocols.

More information availible at http://www.php.net/ 

This port is worked by Jakob Schlyter <jakob@@openbsd.org>.
