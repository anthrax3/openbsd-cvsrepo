1.2
log
@Update to seamonkey 2.26rc1 (to ride the mozilla.port.mk changes) and
lightning 3.1.

- See http://www.seamonkey-project.org/releases/seamonkey2.26/
- Fixes MFSA 2014-34,36->39,41->47
- remove now useless config.mk patch, was only here for enigmail
- add patches to fix lightning display (#1001985)
- set spellchecker.dictionary_path to look for systemwide dicts

(note that seamonkey-i18n is not update yet on purpose, as 2.26 final is
not yet available, langpacks are not there *yet* - will be fixed tmrw)

log
@Update to seamonkey 2.25.

- See http://www.seamonkey-project.org/releases/seamonkey2.25/
- Fixes MFSA-2014-15->32 (except 21,24,25, not relevant to SM?)
- Remove enigmail subpackage, build goo & patches, will be
superseded by mail/enigmail,-seamonkey
- add an all-openbsd.js file to customize default preferences and
install it in defaults/pref/. Use it to set
extensions.autoDisableScopes to 3, so that extensions installed in
${LOCALBASE}/lib/mozilla/extensions/${APPID} are enabled by default.
- remove libffi patches, were merged upstream in #928390 and #928381
