To disable anti-aliasing (xft) set GDK_USE_XFT=0 in the environment.

Plugins

Seamonkey looks for plugins in ~/.mozilla/plugins,
${LOCALBASE}/lib/mozilla-plugins, and ${TRUEPREFIX}/seamonkey/plugins.
If the environment variable MOZ_PLUGIN_PATH is specified, this
location will be overridden.

Using Java Applets

To make Applets work, you must symlink (not copy) the file
libjavaplugin_oji.so into one of the directories listed above.
This might be done like the following:

$ cd ~/.mozilla/plugins
$ ln -s ${LOCALBASE}/jdk-1.5.0/jre/plugin/i386/ns7/libjavaplugin_oji.so .
$   

Information on building Java (on some platforms) can be found in
http://www.openbsd.org/faq/faq13.html#javaflash

Internationalization

This package contains internationalizations for all supported
languages.  To configure Seamonkey for your language, go to
Edit->Preferences->Appearance->Languages/Content and select your
favorite Language/Content pack.

Debugging

If you encounter crashes, you might want to build the debug FLAVOR of
this package, and run 'seamonkey -g' to run seamonkey inside gdb, so
that you can gather debugging logs and traces.
Bug reports without that information will be ignored.

@Do the PFRAG dance so that it provides a working debug-flavoured
package. Add a run-mozilla.sh patch to make it found our gdb by default.
Teach users how to properly debug mozilla ports.

Loading of external images has been turned off by default on
OpenBSD. To turn it back on goto Edit -> Preferences -> Mail &
Newsgroups -> Message Display and enable "Allow messsages to
load and display remote images and other content". However,
it is recommended that you leave it off to avoid unwanted
internet connections and possible future exploits against
Mail & News.

@import seamonkey-1.0.7

Web-browser, advanced e-mail and newsgroup client, IRC chat client,
and HTML editing made simple -- all your Internet needs in one
application.

Based mostly on a port from James Wright <jamesw at bsdhosting.co.za> with
input from several - thanks! Tested on i386/amd64/sparc64/macppc.
