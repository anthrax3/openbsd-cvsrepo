log
@Update to seamonkey 2.2, based on Firefox/Thunderbird/Gecko 5.
See http://www.seamonkey-project.org/releases/seamonkey2.2/ for details.
- sync ipc patches from Firefox
- remove a bunch of useless patches
- install under lib/seamonkey-2.2 instead of using our homegrown install
  target.
- install langpacks as plain xpi instead of unzipping them, greatly
  shrinking PLIST
