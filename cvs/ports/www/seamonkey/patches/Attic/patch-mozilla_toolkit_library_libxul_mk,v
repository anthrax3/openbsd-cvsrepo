@Update to seamonkey 2.30 / lightning-seamonkey 3.5.

- See http://www.seamonkey-project.org/releases/seamonkey2.30/
- Fixes MFSA 2014-74-->82
- build with systemwide icu4c, workarounds #1064665 (and as a side
  effect shrinks the libs/packages by 1 or 2 megs)
- for consistency with firefox, build with gstreamer1 instead of
  gstreamer-0.10
- add patch-toolkit_library_libxul_mk from bug #1036832 to workaround a
  linking failure with our ancient binutils
- remove patch-media_libvpx_Makefile_in from #982693 fixing libvpx build
  on i386, a variation of it was merged upstream
- remove patch-mozilla_js_src_configure_in, didnt apply anymore and was
  useless
