@Update to seamonkey 2.25.

- See http://www.seamonkey-project.org/releases/seamonkey2.25/
- Fixes MFSA-2014-15->32 (except 21,24,25, not relevant to SM?)
- Remove enigmail subpackage, build goo & patches, will be
superseded by mail/enigmail,-seamonkey
- add an all-openbsd.js file to customize default preferences and
install it in defaults/pref/. Use it to set
extensions.autoDisableScopes to 3, so that extensions installed in
${LOCALBASE}/lib/mozilla/extensions/${APPID} are enabled by default.
- remove libffi patches, were merged upstream in #928390 and #928381

@As done in thunderbird, merge enigmail/seamonkey port into seamonkey
port so that seamonkey is not built twice, and enigmail-seamonkey is
built as a subpackage of seamonkey, like lightning...
add @@conflict/@@pkgpath markers to allow seamless updates from previous
enigmail-seamonkey packages.
