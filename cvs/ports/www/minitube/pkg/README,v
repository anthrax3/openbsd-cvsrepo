Google API key
==============
Minitube 2.4 has been ported to the new YouTube API version 3, hence an
API key is now required in order to access the YouTube Data web services.

Go to https://console.developers.google.com/

Log in using your Google account

Click on "Create Project"

Enter a Project name (e.g.: "Minitube")

On the left side bar, expand the "APIs & auth" drop-down menu and
click on "Credentials"

Click on "Create new Key" and then on "Browser key"

Click on "Create"

You should get an output like the one below:

Key for browser applications
  API key			AIzaSyD7zlL9sAC6-IcwU7Bpds8lZNzmqQTmALQ
  Referers			Any referer allowed
  Activation date		Apr 28, 2015, 2:02:00 AM
  Activated by			johndoe@@gmail.com (you)

Be sure that "YouTube Data API v3" is enabled under "APIs & auth" ->
"APIs" -> "Enabled APIs"

If not, go to "APIs & auth" -> "APIs" -> "API Library", click on "YouTube
Data API" and then on "Enable API" to enable it.

Add the environment variable containing your newly generated key
to your ~/.profile or ~/.xinitrc:

GOOGLE_API_KEY="AIzaSyD7zlL9sAC6-IcwU7Bpds8lZNzmqQTmALQ"
export GOOGLE_API_KEY

Phonon render method
====================
Minitube uses the old phonon library (from qt4), not the newer kde4
phonon library (multimedia/phonon). If you would like to use OpenGL
as the preferred render method for this, export two additional
environment variables into your ~/.profile or ~/.xinitrc:

PHONON_GST_VIDEOMODE=opengl
QT_GL_USE_OPENGL1ENGINE=1
