1.2
log
@Remove the following webapps:
- ezpublish, no maintainer, last updated 2009/08/24
- mantis, no maintainer, out of date
- phplist, very outdated and no-one maintains it
- phpmemcachedadmin, port only extract the distfile and that's it
- vtigercrm, port only extract the distfile and that's it

While we do this in a case-by-case basis, this was done for one of the
following reasons:
* do not give user a sense of security because there is a pkg available
when it is in fact outdated/unmaintained and including possible security
issues
* package with no added value besides extracting the distfile under
/var/www are pretty useless -- they demand an effort to be kept up to
date for no benefits (except if someone actually maintains it of course)
* some webapps must complete a strict version update path -- eg.
updating from 1.0 to 1.5 requires updating to 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 and 1.4
first -- that does not work well with pkg

PS: no we are not in a rampage to remove lots of www apps -- just some when
it makes sense

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------
| Running ${FULLPKGNAME} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The vtiger CRM is installed into ${INSTDIR}

You should point this to the DocumentRoot of your web-server:
   # ln -s ../vtigercrm /var/www/htdocs/vtigercrm
(make sure you use a relative symlink since Apache is chrooted)

Make sure you read the online installation manual before going into
production:
   http://wiki.vtiger.com/index.php/Vtiger_CRM_-_Installation_Manual

*** First install
To complete the installation, you must create an empty MySQL database
and grant a corresponding user all privileges to it.
Then point your web browser to:
http://<hostname>/vtigercrm/install.php

*** Upgrade
To complete the upgrade, login as an admin user, go to the "Settings"
tab then use the "Migration Wizard".
