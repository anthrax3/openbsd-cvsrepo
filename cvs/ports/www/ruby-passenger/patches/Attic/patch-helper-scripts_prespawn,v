@Update to passenger 5.0.14

Remove subpackages, revert to a single package, since standalone package
is now only 10% the size of the main package.

Just because you can listen on 0.0.0.0 does not mean you can
connect to it.

1.1
log
@Update to 3.0.11.  Support by the standalone version of passenger by
splitting into a multipackage, with a subpackage for the standalone
version (which embeds a version of nginx).  The standalone version
operates much like other ruby webservers, serving a single ruby/rack
application.

Switch to using the gem version of passenger.  Because the gem
installs into a versioned directory, setup symlinks to the
versioned directory so that nginx configuration files don't need
to be modified when the version is updated.
