@Update to passenger 5.0.30

Update embedded nginx to 1.10.2.

Support nginx dynamic modules.

All files that were patched previously got moved, add patches for the
new locations.

Remove all of the pointless hiding of build steps behind progress bars.

@Update to passenger 5.0.14

Remove subpackages, revert to a single package, since standalone package
is now only 10% the size of the main package.
