log
@Update ruby-passenger to 3.0.0.  Switch the directory name from
phusion_passenger to phusion-passenger, since that's the name used
by upstream. Also tested by Pierre-Yves Ritschard.

1.1
log
@The old version of boost included in this port assumes that GCC 4.1 and later
always provide the new atomic builtins.  In reality those are only available
on hardware that provides the necessary atomic instructions.  PA-RISC doesn't
have a suitable set of atomic instructions so work around it on hppa.
