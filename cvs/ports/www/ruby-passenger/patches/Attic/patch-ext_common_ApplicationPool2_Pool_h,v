@Update to passenger 5.0.14

Remove subpackages, revert to a single package, since standalone package
is now only 10% the size of the main package.

Analytics collection fails, due to some issue with parsing the
output of ps.  There's a complete lack of debugging code (e.g
showing where the parse error occurs in the ps output), so it
would be difficult to fix the problem.  As analytics are not
useful unless being reported to Phusion's "Union Station" app,
it's probably best to skip this code entirely.
