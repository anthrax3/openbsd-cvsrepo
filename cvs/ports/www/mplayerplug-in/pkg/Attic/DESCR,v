@I made you a diff to make mplayerplug-in build against xulrunner 1.9.2...
but gecko-mediaplayer eated it^Wis its successor, so let's just drop

media from websites.

This plug-in gives Mozilla the ability to play media from a website the
net without reading the source html and getting the url manually. Media
is played embedded in the page or in a separate window depending on how
