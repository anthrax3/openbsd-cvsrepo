@I made you a diff to make mplayerplug-in build against xulrunner 1.9.2...
but gecko-mediaplayer eated it^Wis its successor, so let's just drop
this abandoned upstream cruft. Its developer works on gecko-mediaplayer
anyway - so you should use it instead..

@- update mplayerplug-in to 3.55
- install plugins into a more appropriate directory (prodded by claudio@@,
done with help from martynas@@)
- fix mplayer zombie and firefox freeze when closing a movie,
with mplayer still playing it.

this makes mplayerplug-in work as it should've.

from mikolaj kucharski, thanks!
