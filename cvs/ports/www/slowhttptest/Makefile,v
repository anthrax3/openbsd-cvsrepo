SlowHTTPTest is a highly configurable tool that simulates some
Application Layer Denial of Service attacks.

It implements most common low-bandwidth Application Layer DoS attacks,
such as slowloris, Slow HTTP POST, Slow Read attack (based on TCP persist
timer exploit) by draining concurrent connections pool, as well as Apache
Range Header attack by causing very significant memory and CPU usage on the
server.

Slowloris and Slow HTTP POST DoS attacks rely on the fact that the HTTP
protocol, by design, requires requests to be completely received by the
server before they are processed. If an HTTP request is not complete, or if
the transfer rate is very low, the server keeps its resources busy waiting
for the rest of the data. If the server keeps too many resources busy, this
creates a denial of service. This tool is sending partial HTTP requests,
trying to get denial of service from target HTTP server.

Slow Read DoS attack aims the same resources as slowloris and slow POST,
but instead of prolonging the request, it sends legitimate HTTP request and
reads the response slowly.
