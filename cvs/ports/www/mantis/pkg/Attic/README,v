@Remove the following webapps:
- ezpublish, no maintainer, last updated 2009/08/24
- mantis, no maintainer, out of date
- phplist, very outdated and no-one maintains it
- phpmemcachedadmin, port only extract the distfile and that's it
- vtigercrm, port only extract the distfile and that's it

While we do this in a case-by-case basis, this was done for one of the
following reasons:
* do not give user a sense of security because there is a pkg available
when it is in fact outdated/unmaintained and including possible security
issues
* package with no added value besides extracting the distfile under
/var/www are pretty useless -- they demand an effort to be kept up to
date for no benefits (except if someone actually maintains it of course)
* some webapps must complete a strict version update path -- eg.
updating from 1.0 to 1.5 requires updating to 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 and 1.4
first -- that does not work well with pkg

ok Wen Heping (MAINTAINER of vtigercrm)

PS: no we are not in a rampage to remove lots of www apps -- just some when
it makes sense

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------
| Running ${FULLPKGNAME} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Mantis has been installed into ${INSTDIR}

You should point this to the DocumentRoot of your web-server:
  # ln -s ../mantis /var/www/htdocs/mantis
(make sure you use a relative symlink since Apache is chrooted)

You can ensure you have a working install by accessing:
http://localhost/mantis

Some important notes:

Choose a database system:

Mantis can use a PostgreSQL or MySQL database.  Install either the php-pgsql
or the php-mysql package before you use Mantis.

Configuring:

Configure most of Mantis over the browser.  You will then need to edit the file
${INSTDIR}/mantis/config_defaults_inc.php.  Consult the
${INSTDIR}/mantis/doc/README file for more information.

Protecting the admin directory:

Make sure that you properly protect the /mantis/admin location to prevent
accessing it by unauthorized persons.  The following fragment for
/var/www/conf/httpd.conf limits access to clients connecting from localhost.
You might want to even password protect this location.

<Location "/mantis/admin">
        <Limit GET>
                Order allow,deny
                Allow from localhost
        </Limit>
</Location>

Changing the administrator password

Once you have configured you Mantis installation, login as the administrator
user with the default password 'root' and change it before you make yourxi
installation available.
