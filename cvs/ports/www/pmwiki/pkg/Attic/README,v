@Remove pmwiki -- the port brings no added value and is not maintained.
Safer to rely on usptream's tarballs directly.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------
| Running ${FULLPKGNAME} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

PmWiki has been installed into ${INSTDIR}

You should point this to the DocumentRoot of your web-server:
   # ln -s ../pmwiki /var/www/htdocs/pmwiki
(make sure you use a relative symlink since Apache is chrooted)

You can ensure you have a working install by accessing:
http://<localhost>/pmwiki/pmwiki.php

If you are doing an upgrade from a previous version, please take
a moment to read http://www.pmwiki.org/wiki/PmWiki/ReleaseNotes .
