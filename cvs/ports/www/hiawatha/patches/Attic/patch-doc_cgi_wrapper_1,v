 The CGI wrapper is part of the Hiawatha webserver. See hiawatha(1) for more information about Hiawatha.
 
 .SH CGI WRAPPER
-The CGI wrapper can be used to run certain CGI programs with a different userid then Hiawatha's userid. It replaces the HostId option in previous versions. To function properly, the CGI wrapper binary needs the su-bit. To prevent abuse, it has the necessary security checks. As a result, the CGI wrapper can only be executed by Hiawatha. Via the configuration file (/etc/hiawatha/cgi_wrapper.conf), you can specify what the CGI wrapper is allowed to execute.

@Import hiawatha-5.4

Hiawatha is a secure webserver for Unix. It has been written with 'being
secure' as its main goal.  Hiawatha has many security features that no
other webserver has.
Hiawatha does not have all the fancy features, but it is very secure and
fast and is really easy to configure.  Rootjail, run CGIs under any
uid/gid you want, prevention of SQL injection and cross-site scripting,
banning of clients who try such exploits and many other features make
Hiawatha an interesting webserver for those who need more security than
what the other available webservers are offering.
