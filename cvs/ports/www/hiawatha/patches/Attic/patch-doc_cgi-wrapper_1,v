 The CGI-wrapper can be used to run certain CGI programs with a different userid then the webserver's userid. To function properly, the CGI-wrapper binary needs the su-bit. To prevent abuse, it has the necessary security checks. The CGI-wrapper can only be executed by the Hiawatha webserver. It uses the Hiawatha PID-file for this verification.
 
 .SH CONFIGURATION
-The CGI-wrapper can be configured via the configuration file /etc/hiawatha/cgi-wrapper.conf. The following options are available:
+The CGI-wrapper can be configured via the configuration file !!SYSCONFDIR!!/hiawatha/cgi-wrapper.conf. The following options are available:
 .TP
 .B CGIhandler = <CGI handler>[, <CGI handler>, ...]
 Normally, only files inside the WebsiteRoot will be executed. CGI-handlers are usually not inside this directory. Use this option to specify binaries that are outside the WebsiteRoot and the CGI-wrapper is still allowed to execute.
