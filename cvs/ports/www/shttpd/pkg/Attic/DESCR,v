@since this depends on some djbware and since they were removed, we also

@echo-httpd, redir-httpd, and cgi-httpd are HTTP daemons designed
to complement publicfile.

* echo-httpd echos HTTP requests. 
* echo-config configures echo-httpd. 
* redir-httpd redirects HTTP requests via cdb lookup. 
* redir-config configures redir-httpd. 
* cgi-httpd executes a cgi script. 
* cgi-config configures cgi-httpd. 
* constant-httpd prints the same file for each HTTP request. 
* constant-config configures constant-httpd. 

Each instance of an shttpd daemon listens on a separate address,
in a chroot directory, typically running as a nonprivileged user.
