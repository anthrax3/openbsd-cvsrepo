@web forms: flexible creation of complex forms (quizzes) that
can be presented to users, stored on the website, and exported
to csv.

To build a quiz, you most often want to enable only grid, markup,
and select fields, then create your quizz.

The author should submit a `perfect' answer, then you can give it
to other users.
