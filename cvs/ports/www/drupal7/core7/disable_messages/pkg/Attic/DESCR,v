@scrub old shit and wrong import

@Gives a site owner options to disable specific messages shown to end
users. The core drupal message system as offered by drupal_set_message
is an excellent way for modules to send out messages to the end users.
However not all drupal site owners are keen to show all the messages
sent out by drupal core and all modules to their users. This module
gives site administrators a reasonably powerful way to filter out
messages shown to the end users.
