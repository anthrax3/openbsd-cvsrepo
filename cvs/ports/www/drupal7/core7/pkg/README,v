| Running ${FULLPKGNAME} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

To enable a decent configuration of drupal, please create a symbolic
link:

ln -sf ../modules.sample/${DRUPAL}.conf \
	/var/www/conf/modules

Drupal can work with a PostgreSQL, MySQL or SQLite3 database.
Support for SQLite3 is included with the main php package; to use
another database, the corresponding package needs to be installed:
    php-pdo_pgsql or php-pdo_mysql

If you just want to try out drupal, you don't need any database server,
an sqlite file will do just fine.

Don't forget to set the character set to utf8 in your database.

In mysql, assuming you're connected as admin initially.

create user drupal@@localhost identified by 'password';
create database drupal character set utf8;
grant all on drupal.* to drupal@@localhost;

Note that the default max_allowed_packet is too small if you install
a few modules. See /etc/my.cnf.

In postgresql, assuming an `admin' account has all rights:

createuser -U admin --pwprompt --no-superuser --createdb --no-createrole drupal
createdb -U drupal -E UTF8 drupal

Updating from a drupal6 installation:
