@Ubercart is a set of modules designed to allow you to run a store on
your Drupal site.  Development has been driven by two major emphases:
flexibility and usability.  The various systems driving Ubercart,
including the product catalog, shopping cart and checkout, order,
shipping, and payment systems have all been designed to be extended to
meet any need.  Furthermore, the administrative interface, particularly
relating to processing and fulfilling orders, has been designed for ease
of use and efficient display of information.
