@Update to squid-3.3.10 and reorganise the squid ports; retire squid-2.7
(it was kept separately because 3.x didn't build on some arch due to an
incomplete atomic ops autoconf check which has since been repaired) and
replace with 3.4 (devel version). Enable additional helpers and turn on
support for rock cache dirs.

@Squid is a high-performance proxy caching server for web clients,
supporting FTP, gopher, and HTTP data objects. Unlike traditional caching
software, Squid handles all requests in a single, non-blocking, I/O-driven
process.

Squid keeps meta data and especially hot objects cached in RAM, caches DNS
lookups, supports non-blocking DNS lookups, and implements negative
caching of failed requests.

Squid supports SSL, extensive access controls, and full request logging.
By using the lightweight Internet Cache Protocol, Squid caches can be
arranged in a hierarchy or mesh for additional bandwidth savings.

Flavors:
	ldap - Support for LDAP
	ntlm - Support for NTLM
	snmp - Support for SNMP

@Re-import squid 2.7.STABLE9 under www/squid27, same as the previous port
in www/squid as of 2012/11/26 plus a REVISION bump. The newer version works
well in most cases, but is less portable and seems to have problems with
certain configurations.  ok ajacoutot.
