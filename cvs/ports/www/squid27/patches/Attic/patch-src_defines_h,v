@Update to squid-3.3.10 and reorganise the squid ports; retire squid-2.7
(it was kept separately because 3.x didn't build on some arch due to an
incomplete atomic ops autoconf check which has since been repaired) and
replace with 3.4 (devel version). Enable additional helpers and turn on
support for rock cache dirs.

log
@Re-import squid 2.7.STABLE9 under www/squid27, same as the previous port
in www/squid as of 2012/11/26 plus a REVISION bump. The newer version works
well in most cases, but is less portable and seems to have problems with
certain configurations.  ok ajacoutot.
