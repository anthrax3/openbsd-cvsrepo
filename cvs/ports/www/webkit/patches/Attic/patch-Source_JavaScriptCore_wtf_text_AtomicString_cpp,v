@Major update to webkit-1.4.0.
Now comes with a gtk3 FLAVOR that can be installed alongside the non
flavored package (webkit vs webkit-gtk3).

The library name changed from libwebkit to libwebkit-gtk{1,3}.

thanks to landry@@ and jasper@@ for the tests on powerpc, sparc64 and
amd64.
bulk testing from landry@@
