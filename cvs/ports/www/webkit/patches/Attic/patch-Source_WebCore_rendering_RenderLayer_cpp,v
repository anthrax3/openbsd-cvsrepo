1.2
log
@Major update to webkit 1.8.0.

- disable static libs, shrinks package size by a factor 3
- now depends on geoclue for geolocation purposes (of course its up to
  the browsers to enable the feature or not..)
- simplify Makefile/FLAVORS/SHARED_LIBS
- fold most of the PFRAGs to PLIST by using variables
- remove patch-Source_JavaScriptCore_runtime_JSValue_h, seems it was
  added for sparc64 but now it breaks the build there, and noone has been
able to justify the addition of that patch. Without it, GtkLauncher
shows simple html websites on sparc64 and crashes as soon as some js is
involved, but thats not much different from before
- remove patch-Source_JavaScriptCore_wtf_text_StringHash_h &
  patch-Source_JavaScriptCore_wtf_text_StringImpl_cpp, replaced by
patch-Source_JavaScriptCore_runtime_UString_h for mips64/sparc64
- add patch-Source_JavaScriptCore_wtf_NumberOfCores_cpp for #82585

tested on i386/amd64 by several, amd64 bulk build, ppc & sparc64 testing
by myself. mips64el in the works..
