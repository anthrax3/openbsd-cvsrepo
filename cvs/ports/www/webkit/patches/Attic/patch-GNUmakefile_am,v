@Update to webkit 1.1.5v0, finally switch to plain releases instead of
tracking a random svn snapshot, as webkit-gtk has regular releases now.

log
@Update to webkit-svn r41121. The http backend switched from curl to
libsoup, tweak WANTLIB accordingly. Patch autogen.sh and run it instead
of manually running automake and autoconf (which turned out to be hairy)

1.1
log
@Update Webkit to r40000 svn snapshot.
While here, link with -pthread instead of -lpthread, spotted by
ajacoutot@@.
Remove the BROKEN marker on sparc64 upon jasper@@'s request to let
gnome/devhelp build, although it still SIGBUS'es badly at runtime
(which is being worked on, and driving me nuts)
