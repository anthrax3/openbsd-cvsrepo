@Update to webkit 2.4.0.

See http://webkitgtk.org/2014/03/24/webkitgtk2.4.0-released.html. Note
that Webkit2 API is still broken, on OpenBSD(and FreeBSD) and this might
be the last release shipping the Webkit1 API.
Pass -DLOG_DISABLED=0 to CPPFLAGS to somewhat allow debugging.
Use the same ruby version on sparc64 as other archs now that they're
more reliable.

Remove some patches merged upstream, and add links to upstream bz for
most of the remaining patches.

Note: this needs gnu/usr.bin/binutils/include/opcode/i386.h r1.15 to
build. And gcc 4.8 (and python, ruby & perl :)
Built numerous times on amd64/ppc/sparc64 (broken at runtime on the last
two, but that's not a regression from 2.2..) and went in a bunch of
bulks.

@Update to webkit 2.2.0.

- Now depends on newer gcc, use 4.6 by default.
- Enable webkit2 api in the gtk3 FLAVOR. Still broken/erratic behaviour at
  runtime, but at least this will allow people to debug it, and it's
  required by newer GNOMEs anyway. Provide MiniBrowser for debugging purposes.
- add hack from bug #118732 to workaround the fact that our binutils
  doesnt support 'ar T'
- update patches from #103128 to tentatively fix powerpc runtime
- force-disable YARR_JIT & ASSEMBLE on archs without JIT (ie anything
  besides i386/amd64) via Platform.h patch instead of JSC_CPPFLAGS (which
  doesnt work anymore anyway)
- add a bunch of patches to fix build (missing includes etc) in the WebKit2
  source tree

Tested in an amd64 bulk build, runtime-tested previous betas on
i386/amd64, test-built on powerpc and sparc64. Things might still be
broken at runtime on powerpc, but at least it allows more GNOME things
to be updated.
