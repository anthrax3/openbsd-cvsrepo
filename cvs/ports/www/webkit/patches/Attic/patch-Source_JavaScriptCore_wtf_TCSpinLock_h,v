@Major update to webkit 2.0.0.

- add ruby to BDEPS. Webkit build system now uses autohell, python, ruby and perl \o/
- set MODRUBY_REV = 1.8 on sparc64 since 1.9 is broken there
- disable WebKit2 support, it needs shm_open()/shm_unlink()
- switch from gstreamer-0.10 to gstreamer1
- force-disable JIT/ASSEMBLER on non-jit archs, builds fails otherwise (bug #113638)
- only build NumberPrototype.cpp with -O0 on sparc64, not the damn whole thing
- use -Wl,--relax on ppc otherwise linking fails
- move some patches around since JavaScriptCore/wtf moved to WTF/wtf
- dont uselessly rerun make within make during install, gmake blows
- blindly backport upstream r144077 to fix mips64 build
- backport bits of #103128 & r145551 to fix powerpc build
- backport r147967 & more to fix bashisms in configure
- bug #109932 forced the use of gcc >= 4.7 or clang >= 3.0, but this is
  only for WebKit2 so loosen the check atm

Tested working fine on amd64 & i386, went in bulk builds, known broken
at runtime on ppc (being worked on. or not.) should build on mips64el
(and maybe even run!) and sparc64 (wont run! ever! nothing new here..),
but 'someone' will care about the poor exotic archs and fix'em, right ?

After too much prodding from the gnome maintainers who desperately need it

workaround for a g++4 regression(?) on powerpc, reported as
https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=33451 :
JavaScriptCore/wtf/TCSpinLock.h:112: error: 'asm' operand requires impossible reload"
also reported in http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=438415
Another option is :
.if ${MACHINE_ARCH} == "powerpc"
CONFIGURE_ARGS +=	--enable-optimizations=no
.endif

@Major update to webkit-1.4.0.
Now comes with a gtk3 FLAVOR that can be installed alongside the non
flavored package (webkit vs webkit-gtk3).

The library name changed from libwebkit to libwebkit-gtk{1,3}.

thanks to landry@@ and jasper@@ for the tests on powerpc, sparc64 and
amd64.
bulk testing from landry@@
