@Major update to webkit-1.4.0.
Now comes with a gtk3 FLAVOR that can be installed alongside the non
flavored package (webkit vs webkit-gtk3).

The library name changed from libwebkit to libwebkit-gtk{1,3}.

thanks to landry@@ and jasper@@ for the tests on powerpc, sparc64 and
amd64.
bulk testing from landry@@

@Add a bunch of patches from Todd Carson <toc at daybefore dot net> to
allow webkit to build (and even run!) on mips64el, many thanks !
Patches will probably need to be reworked so that they can be fed
upstream, but at least this allows another part of the tree to build on
loongson. And this might even work for sgi.
