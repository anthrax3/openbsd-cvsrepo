1.1
log
@patch apache httpd CVE-2017-9798, backported from upstream's branches/2.4.x

This is a use after free error that causes a corrupted Allow header to
be constructed in response to HTTP OPTIONS requests. It can leak pieces
of arbitrary memory from the server process that may contain secrets.
The memory pieces change after multiple requests, so for a vulnerable
host an arbitrary number of memory chunks can be leaked.

The bug appears if a webmaster tries to use the "Limit" directive with
an invalid HTTP method.

Revision 1807754
Fri Sep 8 13:13:11 2017 UTC by ylavic
Merge r1807655 from trunk:

core: Disallow Methods' registration at run time (.htaccess), they may be
used only if registered at init time (httpd.conf).

Calling ap_method_register() in children processes is not the right scope
since it won't be shared for all requests.
