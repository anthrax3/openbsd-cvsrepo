@Fix MESSAGE/UNMESSAGE, since the php infrastructure changes this was telling
people to adjust /usr/local/conf/php5.sample/xcache.ini rather than the correct
file. ok Brad (maintainer).

@You can disable this module by removing the
${PREFIX}/conf/php5/xcache.ini symbolic link by
issuing the following command: 

rm -f ${PREFIX}/conf/php5/xcache.ini

If you already have Apache running on your machine,
you should not use "apachectl restart" - instead,
you should fully stop and then restart the server.

You'll also need to remove the associated lines from 
your php.ini file.

@from Brad:
- Maintenance update of XCache, also tested by myself.

from me:
- adjust for /var/www/conf/php5 symlinks
- add re2c as BUILD_DEPENDS, configure picks it up if installed

XCache is a fast, stable PHP opcode cacher that has been tested and is
now running on production servers under high load.
