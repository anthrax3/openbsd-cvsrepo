1.2

@Update to drush-8.0.3.

This is packaged from a locally generated tarball, built from the downloaded
github archive, plus required dependencies installed via composer. Specifically
not using upstream's normal .phar because we need to patch it so backups work
(it uses options not supported by base tar).

Drop the forced dependency on Drupal 6 as this is suitable for D6/7/8 and is
useful for people who have installed Drupal outside of ports.

@Drush is a command line shell and Unix scripting interface for Drupal,
allowing most administration tasks to be done without using the web
interface.

It ships with lots of useful commands for interacting with code like
modules/themes/profiles, it is able to run updates, execute sql queries
and DB migrations, and other utilities like running cron or clearing
cache. Drush can be extended by 3rd party commandfiles.

Note that drush should be invoked from the directory where Drupal is
installed, or using the -r option.
