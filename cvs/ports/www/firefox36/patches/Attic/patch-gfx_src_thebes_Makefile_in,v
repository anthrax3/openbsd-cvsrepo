@Remove useless dependency on deprecated pangox.

- remove useless patch to gfx/thebes/Makefile.in adding -lpangox-1.0 to
EXTRA_DSO_LDOPTS, this was maybe useful before ffx 3.0, but mozilla
stopped using pangox between 2.0 and 3.0. See for the last traces of
pangox.h use : https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=528941. See
also bugs #323671/#338446
- backport the patch from #528941 to remove useless pangox.h inclusion
from www/firefox35.
- remove the RUN_DEPENDS on pangox-compat
- bump all corresponding REVISIONS
- while here, make sure all moz ports depend on latest nspr 4.9.2 since
  it'll be a requirement for upcoming gecko 16 releases
