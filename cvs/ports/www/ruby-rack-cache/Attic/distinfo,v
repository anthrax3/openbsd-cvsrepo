@Remove www/ruby-rails and dependencies.  The current version is
out of date and subject to serious security vulnerabilities, updating
it causes a lot of ports churn for little benefit, and nobody has
offered to maintain it.

@Import ruby-rack-cache 1.1, a Rails 3.1 dependency

Rack::Cache is suitable as a quick drop-in component to enable HTTP
caching for Rack-based applications that produce freshness (Expires,
Cache-Control) and/or validation (Last-Modified, ETag) information.

    Standards-based (see RFC 2616 / Section 13).
    Freshness/expiration based caching
    Validation
    Vary support
    Portable: 100% Ruby / works with any Rack-enabled framework.
    Disk, memcached, and heap memory storage backends.
