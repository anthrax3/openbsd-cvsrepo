@AWStats is a free powerful and featureful tool that generates
advanced web, streaming, ftp or mail server statistics, graphically.

This log analyzer works as a CGI or from command line and shows you
all possible information your log contains, in few graphical web
pages. It uses a partial information file to be able to process
large log files, often and quickly. It can analyze log files from
all major server tools like Apache log files (NCSA combined/XLF/ELF
log format or common/CLF log format), WebStar, IIS (W3C log format)
and a lot of other web, proxy, wap, streaming servers, mail servers
and some ftp servers.
