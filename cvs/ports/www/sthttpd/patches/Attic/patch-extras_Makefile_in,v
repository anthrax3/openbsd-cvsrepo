@sthttpd is a simple, small, fast, and secure HTTP server. It doesn't have
a lot of special features, but it suffices for most uses of the web,
it's about as fast as the best full-featured servers (Apache, NCSA,
Netscape), and it has one extremely useful feature (URL-traffic-based
throttling) that no other server currently has.
