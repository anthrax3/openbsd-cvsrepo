@don't call back home for google & mozilla in some more places.
1. what ff3's safebrowsing does it essentially allows google to
track users.  every time ff3 would call to google w/ the address
of the particular site one is visiting.  disable this crazy feature
2. don't visit mozilla's pages on updating / first starting the
browser;  which serve no purpose but tracking
3. disable the crashreporter;  which is supposed to automatically
talk to mozilla and send all sorts of information when you crash
discussed w/ porters.  ok naddy@@
