@import firefox3-3.0.1, intended as a replacement for mozilla-firefox,
when we decide it's stable enough
not linked to the builds yet.

this version has the following fixes:
- fix SQLITE_VERSION, NSS_VERSION
- we've got our own library versioning, so remove versions and let
dlopen do the job
- fix the ssl psm bug.  you can't just cast a char* to an int* and
access through it
- fix arm Makefiles, to catch the right invokes/stubs
- fix arm, endianness issue (armel abi)
- strict alignment fixes for sparc64
- update to accept standard dictionaries location, so that
textproc/mozilla-dicts works again
- fix to include the right dlfcn.h
- remove eula
- printing fix, which kurt@@ has tracked down, and helped fixing

tested by many, kili@@, ian@@, sthen@@, jdixon@@, reyk@@, others...

the way to handle update has been suggested by pval@@
the package name has been discussed w/ kurt@@ and naddy@@
ok kurt@@ and naddy@@
