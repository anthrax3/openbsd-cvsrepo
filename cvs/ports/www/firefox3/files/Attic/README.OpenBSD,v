If you encounter strange problems relating to bookmarks, downloads,
window placement, toolbars, history, or other settings, it is
recommended that you create a new profile and attempt to
reproduce the problem before filing bugs.  To create a new profile,
start Firefox with the -ProfileManager switch, e.g.
firefox -ProfileManager, and click "Create Profile".

If Firefox doesn't start at all, try starting it with -safe-mode
switch, which disables extensions and themes for your session.

To disable anti-aliasing (xft) set GDK_USE_XFT=0 in the environment.

Using mailto: links

To enable mailto: links in Firefox to open in your mail program,
you may have to set a mailto protocol handler. Type "about:config"
in Firefox's URL text field.  Type "mailto" in the filter.  If there
is a string called "network.protocol-handler.app.mailto", its value
names the application for mailto URLs. If present, right click,
choose Modify, and enter the path to your mail program, e.g.,
"!!LOCALBASE!!/bin/thunderbird" or "!!LOCALBASE!!/bin/kmail" (other
programs may work, but these two have been tested).  If absent,
right click, choose New String. Set the name to
"network.protocol-handler.app.mailto" and the value to the path to
your mailer.

Plugins

Firefox looks for plugins in ~/.mozilla/plugins,
!!PREFIX!!/lib/mozilla-plugins, and !!PREFIX!!/mozilla-firefox/plugins.
If the environment variable MOZ_PLUGIN_PATH is specified, this
location will be overridden.

Using Java Applets

To make Applets work, you must symlink (not copy) the file
libjavaplugin_oji.so into one of the directories listed above.
This might be done like the following:

$ cd ~/.mozilla/plugins
$ ln -s !!LOCALBASE!!/jdk-1.5.0/jre/plugin/i386/ns7/libjavaplugin_oji.so .
$   

Information on building Java (on some platforms) can be found in
http://www.openbsd.org/faq/faq13.html#javaflash

Enabling ECC cipher suites

Open the URL about:config and type security.ssl3 in the search
filter. This will bring up a list of all available cipher suites.
Double-click on any cipher to toggle its state. For example, to
enable TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA, double-click on
security.ssl3.ecdhe_ecdsa_aes128_sha until its boolean entry in the
Value column changes to true.

Using CUPS and LPR for printing

Since version 3, Firefox uses standard printing dialog from gtk+2.
In order to use CUPS for printing, you will need to install cups
subpackage of gtk+2, i.e.:

# pkg_add gtk+2-cups

Gtk+2 doesn't try to use LPR printing backend by default.  In order
to use LPR for printing, create ~/.gtkrc-2.0 with the following
contents:

gtk-print-backends = "file,lpr,cups"

If you want to make this change available for all users, use
/etc/gtkrc instead of ~/.gtkrc-2.0.

Scaled images render incorrectly

Due to incompatibilities between some of the drivers and X server,
scaled images may render incorrectly.  Possible workarounds are:

(Known to fix using NVIDIA cards.)
DefaultDepth 16

(Known to fix using ATI cards.)
Option "AccelMethod" "EXA"
Option "XAANoOffscreenPixmaps"

@- use system libm
- add a note to README.OpenBSD about making printing w/ lpr work
(now that ff3 uses default printing dialog from gtk+2).  idea from

@extend documentation, after emails i've got
- since version 3, ff uses standard printing dialog from gtk+2.  in
order to continue using cups for printing, you will need to install
cups subpackage of gtk+2.  after an email from Giovanni Bechis
- ff3 may not render scaled images properly due to incompatibilities
between some of the x drivers and x server (this has been fixed in
the new xserver).  document work-arounds for now.  after an email

1.1.1.1
log
@import firefox3-3.0.1, intended as a replacement for mozilla-firefox,
when we decide it's stable enough
not linked to the builds yet.

this version has the following fixes:
- fix SQLITE_VERSION, NSS_VERSION
- we've got our own library versioning, so remove versions and let
dlopen do the job
- fix the ssl psm bug.  you can't just cast a char* to an int* and
access through it
- fix arm Makefiles, to catch the right invokes/stubs
- fix arm, endianness issue (armel abi)
- strict alignment fixes for sparc64
- update to accept standard dictionaries location, so that
textproc/mozilla-dicts works again
- fix to include the right dlfcn.h
- remove eula
- printing fix, which kurt@@ has tracked down, and helped fixing

tested by many, kili@@, ian@@, sthen@@, jdixon@@, reyk@@, others...

the way to handle update has been suggested by pval@@
the package name has been discussed w/ kurt@@ and naddy@@
