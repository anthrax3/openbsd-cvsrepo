log
@Switch pear to a newer version. We previously used a tarball with a slightly
modified version of the go-pear php script but this was awkward to generate
and newer versions no longer support recent PHP. So instead I have changed
to using an unmodified go-pear.phar archive (mirrored to include a version
number, but there are no changes to the upstream file).

go-pear.phar is normally interactive and doesn't allow presetting parameters
or just piping a simple list of answers, so I am driving it with Expect.pm
instead.

Some bumps/updates to follow as XML-Util moved to the main pear distro.

@Force the installation of packages so we can create packages even
if a specific pear- package is already installed on the system.
This commit also disables the dependency tracking while installing
pear packages with the ports tree.

log
@import of pear-1.5.0;

This port is going to replace the -pear subpackage of www/php5/core.
We have been planning this for a long time now.
Currently is not hooked to the builds, because it needs more testing.
