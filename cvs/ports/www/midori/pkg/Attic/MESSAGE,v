@If midori complains about missing icons, install a freedesktop.org
compliant icon-theme (like gnome-icon-theme or tango-icon-theme) and
set it as default through a ~/.gtkrc-2.0 file containing :

gtk-icon-theme-name = "<theme name>"

@Update to midori 0.1.5, which will make a lot of ppl happy as with last
webkit & libsoup updates it now supports cookies and works fine with gmail.
While here, remove the https notice in MESSAGE, as https pages works
fine now.
