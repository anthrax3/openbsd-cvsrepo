Import of zope-btreefolder2-1.0

BTreeFolder2 is a Zope product that acts like a Zope folder but can
store many more items.

When you fill a Zope folder with too many items, both Zope and your
browser get overwhelmed. Zope has to load and store a large folder
object, and the browser has to render large HTML tables repeatedly. Zope
can store a lot of objects, but it has trouble storing a lot of objects
in a single standard folder.
