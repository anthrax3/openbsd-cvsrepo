JavaScript::Minifier::XS is a JavaScript "minifier"; its designed to remove
un-necessary whitespace and comments from JavaScript files, which also not
breaking the JavaScript.

JavaScript::Minifier::XS is similar in function to JavaScript::Minifier, but is
substantially faster as its written in XS and not just pure Perl.
