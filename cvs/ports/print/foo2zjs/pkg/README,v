+-----------------------------------------------------------------------
| Running ${FULLPKGNAME} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Before using foo2zjs you may need to get some extra files from the web:
ICM profiles (for color correction) and/or firmware using the command
    ${TRUEPREFIX}/share/doc/foo2zjs/getweb

Then copy the downloaded file(s) into the corresponding directory under
    ${TRUEPREFIX}/share/foo2*

If your printer requires a firmware load and attaches as ugen(4) device,
run the following command as root each time the device is powered up:
    cat ${TRUEPREFIX}/share/foo2zjs/firmware/XXX.dl > /dev/ugenN.EE
-> XXX is your printer firmware name
-> /dev/ugenN.EE is the ugen(4) device (N) and endpoint (EE) of your
   printer; which can be found using
   # usbdevs -vd
Alternatively, hotplugd(8) attach/detach scripts can automate this.

Firmwares for some printers are available in the sysutils/firmware/ulpt
port and will be installed under /etc/firmware/. If your printer
attaches as ulpt(4) device the firmware will be loaded automatically.
