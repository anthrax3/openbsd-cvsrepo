@Update to foo2zjs-20100728.
Add a -cups subpackage that contains the command2foo2lava-pjl that
brings support for more features.
Unconditionally enable CUPS commands in the PPD files. Foomatic will
ignore them and CUPS will use them if there.
@
text
@USB printers must attach as a ugen(4) device which means you need to
disable ulpt(4) in your kernel - see config(8).
Your device will be available at /dev/ugenN.EE, where N is the device
number and EE its endoint.
e.g. lp=/dev/ugen0.02 for lpd(8) and usb:/dev/ugen0.02 for cupsd(8).

When using cupsd(8), the _cups user will need r/w access to the device.

Before using foo2zjs you should get extra files from the web, such as
.ICM profiles (for color correction) and firmware using the command
    ${PREFIX}/share/doc/foo2zjs/getweb

Then copy the downloaded file(s) into the corresponding directory under
    ${PREFIX}/share/foo2*

If your printer require a firmware load, run the following command as
root each time the device is powered up:
    cat ${PREFIX}/share/foo2zjs/firmware/XXX.dl > /dev/ugenN.EE
(where XXX is your printer firmware name)
You can use a hotplugd(8) attach script to make it automatic.

If you are using or plan to use CUPS, you can make the PPD files
available to CUPS by creating a symbolic link as in the following
command:

# ln -sf ${PREFIX}/share/foomatic/db/source/PPD \
	${LOCALBASE}/share/cups/model/foomatic-db-ppds

cupsd will need to be restarted to register the new PPDs.

@Import foo2zjs-20070901

foo2zjs is an open source printer driver for printers that use the
Zenographics ZjStream wire protocol for their print data, such as the
Minolta/QMS magicolor 2300 DL or Konica Minolta magicolor 2430 DL.
These printers are often erroneously referred to as winprinters or GDI
printers.
However, Microsoft GDI only mandates the API between an application and
the printer driver, not the protocol on the wire between the printer
driver and the printer.
In fact, ZjStream printers are raster printers which happen to use a
very efficient wire protocol which was developed by Zenographics and
licensed by most major printer manufacturers for at least some of their
product lines.
