@Merge -cups into -main since cups,-libs does not depend on anything.

@foo2zjs is an open source printer driver for printers that use the
Zenographics ZjStream wire protocol for their print data, such as the
Minolta/QMS magicolor 2300 DL or Konica Minolta magicolor 2430 DL.
These printers are often erroneously referred to as winprinters or GDI
printers.
However, Microsoft GDI only mandates the API between an application and
the printer driver, not the protocol on the wire between the printer
driver and the printer.
In fact, ZjStream printers are raster printers which happen to use a
very efficient wire protocol which was developed by Zenographics and
licensed by most major printer manufacturers for at least some of their
product lines.

@Update to foo2zjs-20100728.
Add a -cups subpackage that contains the command2foo2lava-pjl that
brings support for more features.
Unconditionally enable CUPS commands in the PPD files. Foomatic will
ignore them and CUPS will use them if there.
