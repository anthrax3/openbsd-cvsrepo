@Update to fontforge-20110222.

Let it build with png-1.5 (from naddy@@, who surely went blind on it).

While here, patch away some weird attempts to get something meaningful
out of code like this (yes, I show it to you all, you have to share
the pain):

    if ( timezone==0 )
        fprintf( pi->out, "Z)\n" );
    else
        fprintf( pi->out, "%+02d')\n", (int) timezone/3600 );   /* doesn't handle half-hour zones */
