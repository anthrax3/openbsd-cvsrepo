@Initial import of apsfilter 7.2.5

Apsfilter is the number one magic filter for printing under Unix
environment. Its highly configurable and most flexible by global
and printer dependend config files and allowing users to choose
between different print options with lpr on the commandline to get
easy control over layout, speed and quality of the printing process.
Apsfilter supports PS (Postscript) printer and non-PS capable printer
by using Ghostscript as PS emulator. Printing on locally connected
(serial, parallel, USB) and on network printer like Unix-, Windows-,
Novell and AppleTalk remote printer is supported.
