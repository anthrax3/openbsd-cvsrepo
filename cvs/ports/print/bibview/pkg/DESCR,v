@The program "bibview" is a graphical interface for manipulating
BibTeX databases.  It supports the user in making new entries,
searching for entries and moving entries from one BiB to another.
It is possible to work with more than one BiB simultaneously. 
bibview is implemented with Xt and Athena Widgets.

There are six types of windows in bibview:
- The main window contains menus for customizing bibview and
  for working with BiBs on the file level.
- The bibliography window (one for every open BiB) contains commands
  for manipulating the BiB.
- The list window (at most one for every open BiB) shows a list of
  entries.  It displays the fields author, title, type and year.
- The card window (at most one for every entry) helps editing an
  entry.  It contains boxes for each field of the entry (according
  to the type).  The fields can be edited by putting the mouse
  cursor into the field.  Macros in fields and the symbol for
  concatenation ('#') are marked with a preceding '@@'.
