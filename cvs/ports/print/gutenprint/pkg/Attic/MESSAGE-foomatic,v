@Remove the -gimp subpackage. It had a meaning when gimp did not provide
a sensible printing interface but this is not the case anymore. This
also allows to remove gutenprintui2 and gtk+2 dependency.

Rebuild -foomatic against the latest foomatic-db-engine.
The -foomatic package run_depends on foomatic-db. Move some files from
-main to -foomatic.
@
text
@This package only installs the gutenprint data for Foomatic, not the
PPD files.  PPD files can be created using foomatic-ppdfile(1) from the
foomatic-db-engine package as in the following example for an Epson
Stylus C64:

% foomatic-ppdfile -P C64
Epson Stylus C64 Id='Epson-Stylus_C64' Driver='gutenprint' CompatibleDrivers='gutenprint gutenprint-ijs-simplified.${MAJOR_V} gutenprint-ijs.${MAJOR_V}'
% foomatic-ppdfile -p 'Epson-Stylus_C64' -d 'gutenprint-ijs.${MAJOR_V}' > C64.ppd

C64.ppd can then be used with CUPS or with lpd(8) and foomatic-rip(1) as
the input filter.

Note that the 'gutenprint' driver must be compiled into Ghostscript to
work; as this is not the case under OpenBSD, you're advised to use the
ijs driver which will communicate with Ghostscript using libijs.

@- major update to gutenprint 5.2.3 which is the latest stable version

If you're running with locally generated PPD files, you will need to
regen them with foomatic-ppdfile(1) so that the driver uses
gutenprint-ijs.5.2 and not gutenprint-ijs.5.0.

Tested on several printers without regression.

@Import gutenprint-5.0.1

Gutenprint, formerly known as gimp-print, is a project to provide high
quality drivers for Canon, Epson, Lexmark and PCL printers.
This package contains the driver libraries which are the basis of the
gutenprint project, and which can be used by other printing programs. It
may be used with most common UNIX print spooling systems, including
CUPS, lpr, LPRng, or others.

There are 3 subpackages:
* foomatic-db-gutenprint -> Foomatic data for gutenprint drivers
* gutenprint-cups -> gutenprint CUPS driver
* gutenprint-gimp -> Gimp print plug-in


Note: the direct CUPS drivers won't work as they need pstoraster which
will be included with the next ghostscript update; you will still be
able to print with CUPS using foomatic (which most of the time is the
recommended way anyway).
Hopefully, more people will test this now that it's in.
