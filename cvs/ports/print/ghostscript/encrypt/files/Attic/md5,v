1.1.1.1
log
@New ghostscript port, living in a subdir.
Important changes:
- prodded by Nikolay Sturm to do the upgrade,
- Gnu-ghostscript is now 5.50, packaging changed slightly,
- most patches have been integrated,
- use MAKE_FLAGS to remove Makefile patches and gnu-make dependency,
- pull pdf_encrypt out from the main package so that gs can be distributed
on CD-Rom,
- simplify DEVICE_DEVS (get list from NetBSD), removed interactive script
for now, as it wasn't reliably upgraded,
- infrastructure allows for Aladdin ghostscript along-side.
