@Add a gtk flavor that builds gsx with the new display device.

That device is ways faster than the traditional x11 device, especially
with anti-aliasing turned on. Unfortunately, it requires shared libraries
and does not interface with gv.

Note: I hope all devices are back in. Those of you looking for hp850 &
friends support, the driver has been integrated into the `uniprint' driver.

1.1.1.1
log
@Initial import of afpl ghostscript 7.00.
`aladdin' stopped developping ghostscript. What exists is now called
`afpl'.

The 7.00 version offers a whole new set of possibilities. I haven't
even tried for compiling the gtk glue yet, but the most visible one
is the new, much improved aa support in x11 (compare the sample files
with old x11alpha and new x11 with aa options, as per gv).

Rename the directory along, leave aladdin ghostscript alone for now:
in two weeks time, GNU ghostscript 6.51 ships, and this will be just
aladdin ghostscript 6.50 with s/Aladding/GNU/. We want this for the CD.
