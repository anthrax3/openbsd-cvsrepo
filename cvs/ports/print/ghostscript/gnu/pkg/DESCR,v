@Always add the 'display' device for !no_x11.
Thanks to kili@@'s idea, it is possible to make it wok alongside regular
command line invocation whether we have gtk support or not.
This change fixes helpers like libspectre which depend on this device
driver being available (even when we don't want the gtk FLAVOR).

Tweak DESCR while here.

@Ghostscript is the well-known PostScript interpreter which is
available for all common and most esoteric platforms and supports
many different printers, file formats and some displays.

Flavors:
       a4 - Set page size to A4 by default (instead of letter)
      gtk - Build with Gtk+ support
   no_x11 - Build without X support

Build, install and use libgs in all flavors on shared archs. Note:
there is currently no libgs (not even a libgs.a) on static archs.

Install only *one* binary (bin/gs), even in the gtk flavor; the gsc
binary in the gtk flavor was identically to gsx, with the exception
that the display driver (which is the sole purpose of the gtk flavor)
didn't work in gsc.

1.1.1.1
log
@New ghostscript port, living in a subdir.
Important changes:
- prodded by Nikolay Sturm to do the upgrade,
- Gnu-ghostscript is now 5.50, packaging changed slightly,
- most patches have been integrated,
- use MAKE_FLAGS to remove Makefile patches and gnu-make dependency,
- pull pdf_encrypt out from the main package so that gs can be distributed
on CD-Rom,
- simplify DEVICE_DEVS (get list from NetBSD), removed interactive script
for now, as it wasn't reliably upgraded,
- infrastructure allows for Aladdin ghostscript along-side.
