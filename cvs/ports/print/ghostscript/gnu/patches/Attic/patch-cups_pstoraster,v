@Update to gs-9.02 to fix the google maps problem with pdf2ps.

Drop gstoraster (formerly known as ps2raster); it is replaced
by the new gstoraster package.

Also Drop pstopxl, it's currently broken (at least since gs-9.00).
If anyone needs it, please let me know (or patch/repair it yourself
and send me a diff). Note that it would need rather heavy patching
or it had to depend on gnu grep.
