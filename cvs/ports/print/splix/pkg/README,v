Enhancing printing output
=========================
Color printers need color profile files to get better results.  These
files are provided by your printer manufacturer and you have to install
them manually in the correct location.

----------------------------------------------------------------
 NOTE THAT THE LOCATION FOR THE COLOR PROFILE FILES HAS CHANGED
 COMPARED TO SOME EARLIER RELEASES
----------------------------------------------------------------

Early versions of the driver look for color profile files in:
	${TRUEPREFIX}/share/cups/model/<manufacturer>/cms/

This version expects them to be in:
	${TRUEPREFIX}/share/cups/profiles/<manufacturer>/

Where <manufacturer> is samsung, xerox, dell, etc.

If you are updating from a previous release that has profile files in
the old location you must manually relocate them and delete the old
"cms" directory.

To obtain the color profile files download the official Linux drivers 
for your printer and look in the "cms" directory.

Samsung color profile files are available at
    http://splix.ap2c.org/samsung_cms.tar.bz2

Updating from previous versions
===============================
If you are updating from ANY previous version you are strongly advised
to delete and re-install your printer under CUPS. This is because the 
ppd files are often updated between releases. See also the note below.

Upgrade notice
==============
If you are upgrading your current version, you MUST delete your printer
in the CUPS interface and install it again. This operation MUST be done
since CUPS makes a copy of the PPD file and this file is modified
between versions.
