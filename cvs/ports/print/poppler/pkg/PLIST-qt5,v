1.1
log
@Add Qt5 support for poppler.

Tested by kili@@ (maintainer) and sthen@@; also aja@@ tested and okayed
some support patches.

This doesn't fix all "libstdc++ overwrites libestdc++ at runtime" issues,
but at least allows for sthen@@ to proceed. Expect more some ugly tweak
proposals on ports@@ soon.
