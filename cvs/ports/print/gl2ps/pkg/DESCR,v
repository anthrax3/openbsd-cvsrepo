@GL2PS is a C library providing high quality vector output for any OpenGL
application. The main difference between GL2PS and other similar libraries is
the use of sorting algorithms capable of handling intersecting and stretched
polygons, as well as non manifold objects. GL2PS provides advanced smooth
shading and text rendering, culling of invisible primitives, mixed
vector/bitmap output, and much more...

GL2PS can currently create PostScript (PS), Encapsulated PostScript (EPS),
Portable Document Format (PDF) and Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) files, as
well as LaTeX files for the text fragments.

@Import gl2ps.

GL2PS is a C library providing high quality vector output for any OpenGL
application that can currently create PostScript (PS),
Encapsulated PostScript (EPS), Portable Document Format (PDF)
and Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) files, as well as LaTeX files
for the text fragments.

From Ingo Feinerer, thank you!
