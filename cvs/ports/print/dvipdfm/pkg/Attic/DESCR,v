@Dvipdfm is a command-line DVI to PDF translator.

Its features include TeX \special's that approximate the functionality
of the PostScript pdfmarks used by Adobe Acrobat Distiller, the
ability to include PDF files and JPEG files as embedded images,
support for both Type1 and PK fonts, support for arbitrary linear
graphics transformations, a color stack accessible via \special's,
partial font embedding and stream compression for reduced output
file size, native, portable graphics via TPIC \specials, balanced
page and destination trees for improved reader access on very large
document files.
