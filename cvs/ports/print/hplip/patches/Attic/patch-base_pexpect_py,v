1.1
log
@Major update to hplip-3.9.6b.
Refer to the project homepage for the complete changelog.

This port now comes into 5 subpackages (ala Fedora):
- main: complete hplip functionnalities
- hpijs: deprecated hpijs printer driver
- hpcups: new-gen printer driver
- libs: libraries and helpers used by other subpackages
- gui: graphical tools (systray applet...)

It seems this version works a least as good as the previous one we had
in-tree. I could use some feedbacks for the fancier stuffs that hplip
provides (besides regular printing using hpcups and/or hpijs), like
printer communication, ink levels... because I have no hp equipment, but
at least, there was no regression reported.
(some features are Linux-only and are expected not to work)

Tested by several, thanks!
