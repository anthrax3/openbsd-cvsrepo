@Communication with the printer is done via CUPS over libusb, make sure

log
@Major update to hplip-3.9.6b.
Refer to the project homepage for the complete changelog.

This port now comes into 5 subpackages (ala Fedora):
- main: complete hplip functionnalities
- hpijs: deprecated hpijs printer driver
- hpcups: new-gen printer driver
- libs: libraries and helpers used by other subpackages
- gui: graphical tools (systray applet...)

It seems this version works a least as good as the previous one we had
in-tree. I could use some feedbacks for the fancier stuffs that hplip
provides (besides regular printing using hpcups and/or hpijs), like
printer communication, ink levels... because I have no hp equipment, but
at least, there was no regression reported.
(some features are Linux-only and are expected not to work)

Tested by several, thanks!

@Import hplip-2.7.10

This port contains 3 subpackages:

* hplip
HPLIP is an HP developed solution for printing, scanning, and faxing
with HP inkjet and laser based printers in Unix.
The HPLIP project provides printing support for 1,248 printer models,
including Deskjet, Officejet, Photosmart, PSC (Print Scan Copy),
Business Inkjet, LaserJet, Edgeline MFP, and LaserJet MFP.

* hpijs (supersed print/hpijs)
The Hewlett-Packard Co. Linux Inkjet Driver Project is an add-on to the
GNU Ghostscript application. This driver is based on the Hewlett Packard
Appliance APDK for deskjet printers.

* hplip-docs
Documentation for HPLIP in HTML format.
