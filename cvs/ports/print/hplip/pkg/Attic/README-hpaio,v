@One README to rule them all.
Now all the info to setup printers and scanners is under the same place.

Input welcome, after all my frenglish isn't that good...

| Running ${FULLPKGNAME} on OpenBSD

To make the hpaio backend available to SANE, simply add "hpaio" to
the sane-backends configuration file. As root:
    echo "hpaio" >> ${SYSCONFDIR}/sane.d/dll.conf

If the scanner is an all-in-one device and is already configured in CUPS
using an hp:// URI, then it should work out of the box.
e.g.
    scanimage -L                       
    device `hpaio:/net/Officejet_7500_E910?zc=oj-7500a' is a Hewlett-Packard Officejet_7500_E910 all-in-one


Otherwise, you can use the `hp-makeuri' command from the "hplip" package
to create a compatible URI.

e.g. for a network scanner:
    hp-makeuri 192.168.10.100
    <...>
    SANE URI: hpaio:/net/Officejet_7500_E910?ip=192.168.10.100
    <...>

Then pass this URI to your sane(7)-compatible application.
e.g.
    xsane hpaio:/net/Officejet_7500_E910?ip=192.168.10.100

1.1
log
@Add a new hpaio subpackage and re-split this port from scratch.
It allows people with clue to install and use an HP printer/scanner
without the need to install half of the world.
More cleanup coming...
