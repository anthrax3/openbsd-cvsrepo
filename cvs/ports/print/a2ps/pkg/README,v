@Add a pkg-readmes explaining that some external helper tools may be
needed depending on what kind of file(s) one wants to convert.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------
| Running ${FULLPKGNAME} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

a2ps(1) uses external helper commands to convert files to PostScript.

Because usage and needs can be different from one installation to the
other, none of these commands are enforced as a dependency of this
package and it is up the administrator to decide which convertion tool
is needed.

They can be configured under ${SYSCONFDIR}/a2ps{,-site}.cfg.

By default, images are converted using the convert(1) utility from the
ImageMagick package.
