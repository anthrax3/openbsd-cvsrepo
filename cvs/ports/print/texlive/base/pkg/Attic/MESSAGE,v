If you require anything other than the minimal texmf tree then you
should also install texlive_texmf-full (for ConTeXt, XeTeX etc.).  If
you require documentation you should also install texlive_texmf-docs.
This will enable you to use 'texdoc'.

Please backup your TeX configuration files (texmf.cnf, fmtutil.cnf, etc.)
before adding/deleting texlive related packages. It is necessary for the
package tools to manipulate these files.

comprehensive TeX system which includes all the major TeX-related
programs, macro packages, and fonts that are free software, including
support for many languages around the world.
