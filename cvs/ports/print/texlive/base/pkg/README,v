+-----------------------------------------------------------------------
| Running ${FULLPKGNAME} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Texmf Subsets
=============

There are a number of texmf trees in the OpenBSD packages:

texmf-buildset:
  The smallest of the subsets. This is primarily for building OpenBSD
  ports (approx 100M).

texmf-minimal:
  A teTeX like tree, suitable for casual TeX users who do not need many
  extra macros or ConTeXt (approx 250MB).

texmf-full:
  Extra macros (approx 500MB).

texmf-context:
  Macros for the conTeXt typesetter (approx 10MB).

  This was separated because conTeXt maintains it's own hashes separate
  from that of libkpse. As 99% of users don't use this, these hashes are
  generated only when the conTeXt macros are installed.

texmf-doc:
  Documentation (approx 550MB).

  To take load off the OpenBSD mirrors this is only the documentation
  for the texmf-minimal and texmf-buildset trees. This should include
  documentation for the most popular packages.

All sizes are approximate compressed package sizes and the texmf package
contents do not overlap.

There is a *lot* of functionality in texmf-full, so before reporting
"missing" features, please try installing texmf-full first. Eg. xindy
requires texmf-full.

User Local Texmf Trees
======================

Individual users may override or add to the TeX class and style files
supplied by TeX Live by installing them into ~/texmf. There is no need
to run mktexlsr(1) for a texmf tree in a user's $HOME. You can test the
installation by searching for the files using kpsewhich(1). Eg:

% find $HOME/texmf
/home/edd/texmf
/home/edd/texmf/tex
/home/edd/texmf/tex/latex
/home/edd/texmf/tex/latex/acronym
/home/edd/texmf/tex/latex/acronym/acronym.sty
% kpsewhich acronym.sty
/home/edd/texmf/tex/latex/acronym/acronym.sty

LuaLaTeX Bugs
=============

Unfortunately, this version of TeX Live shipped with a slightly buggy version
of LuaLaTeX which can lead to some confusing error messages when compiling
documents.

You can work around this by putting:

    \RequirePackage{luatex85}

as the first line in your source file.

For more information, see:
http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/315198/datetime-package-does-not-work-with-lualatex-in-tl-2016

Other Misc. Notes
=================

Tlmgr
-----

The 'tlmgr' script is disabled in the OpenBSD package. If you were to use
tlmgr to alter/update your texmf, the package tools would become rather upset.

Soft Dependencies
-----------------

Some requirements of TeX Live were not included as dependencies to make the
package less bloated for people who don't need those features.

As far as I know:

 * asymptote is in ports: graphics/asymptote
 * TeX Works is editors/texworks
 * latexmk is textproc/latexmk
 * textproc/py-pygments is required for the minted package.
 * converters/unix2dos is needed for installfont-tl script
 * x11/tk/${MODTK_VERSION} is needed for epspdftk
 * lang/ruby/${MODRUBY_LIBREV} is needed for convbkmk, epspdf, and
   other stuff.
 * Some scripts need bash.

If you know more, please mail the package maintainer.

Notes for Developers
--------------------

 * If you have a port which needs TeX stuff at build time, then it should
   BUILD_DEPENDS upon texlive_base which in turn will pull in
   texlive_texmf-buildset.

 * If the buildset is missing something that your port needs to build, then
   you can depend temporarily upon texlive_texmf-minimal or texlive_texmf-full.
   If you have to do this, please send an email to MAINTAINER so that we can
   have the support you need added to the buildset texmf.

 * If a non-texlive port installs texmf files then they should be installed
   into share/texmf-local, NOT share/texmf or share/texmf-dist.

Have fun TeXing.

@texlive_base: Remove bogus symlink.

Although latexmk is included in texlive, we omit it in favour of our
separate port. texlive_base should not install a symlink.

There was also confusion between latex-mk and latexmk. We have both in
ports, but the latter is the one related to texlive. Let's mark is as a soft
dependency.

Upgrade path is currently leaving a partial package behind due to the bogus
symlink. A quirk will probably be required, which we can commit later.

Upgrade From TeX Live 2009
==========================

Due to inconsistencies in the legacy TeX Live 2009 package, if you
upgraded from TeX live 2009 (at some point in the past) you may see the
package tools complain about non-empty directories. This is harmless,
but can be silenced by (having backed up anything manually added to
texmfs) removing all TeX Live packages, then `rm -Rf ${LOCALBASE}/share/texmf*`.
Now you can install afresh the new TeX Live packages.

1.4
log
@Update to TeX Live 2010.

This year we pre-generate format and maps as requested by kili.

Started adding test cases in the tests/ dir.

Upgrades from 2009 will cause a harmless warning regarding texlinks. Espie is
aware of this, it was not easily fixable.

Uninstalls of texlive 2010 which were previously upgraded from 2009 will make
lots of noise regarding non-empty directories which can not be deleted. This
is due to unregistered package directories in the old texlive 2009 pacakage and
has been fixed in the 2010 package (rblatter script was modified to register
*all* parent dirs in PLISTs).

Installs/uninstalls of texlive 2010 on a fresh system (which has never
seen texlive 2009) are squeaky clean.

This has been in use for a number of months on my work machine, so should be
pretty stable, but I am sure someone will find some obscure bugs. These can be
fixed in tree.
