# This script looks at what TeX Live trees you have installed on
# your OpenBSD system and links the right config file.
#
# It gets called as an @@exec/@@unexec of packages which require
# different fmtutil.cnf's, namely -base and -full.

1.1
log
@- Fix USE_SYSTRACE=Yes builds.

- LOCALBASE -> TRUEPREFIX

- Add a separate script (tl-link-config) to decide which config to
symlink. Fixes the situation where -base gets bumped and so the minimal
fmtutil.cnf gets incorrectly linked when really the -full config is
needed.

from maintainer Edd Barrett.
