@teTeX is _the_ TeX distribution for UNIX compatible systems.  It
contains the latest versions of TeX & friends and nearly everything
you need for happy TeX'ing.  For more information have a look at
the lengthy FEATURES file of the distribution.

This port comes with a simplified setup procedure. See
${SYSCONFDIR}/tetex.cfg for details. This procedure is NOT part of the
official teTeX distribution, so send all questions regarding tetex.cfg
or tetex_setup to the MAINTAINER of this port!
