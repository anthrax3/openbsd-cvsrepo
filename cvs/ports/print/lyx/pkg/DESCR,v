@update LyX to 1.6.6.1, fixing gcc4 build, working better with
Qt4.6, and with many improvements.

worked on by Andreas Kurzegasse, Olivier Cherrier, Daniel Dickman
and with a few tweaks by myself and discussed with Daniel.
@
text
@LyX is a document processor that encourages an approach to writing
based on the structure of your documents and not simply their appearance.
Combining the power and flexibility of TeX/LaTeX with the ease of use
of a graphical interface results in world-class support for creation of
mathematical content (via a fully integrated equation editor) and
structured documents like academic articles, theses, and books.
In addition, staples of scientific authoring such as reference list
and index creation come standard. But you can also use LyX to create
a letter or a novel or a theatre play or film script. A broad array
of ready, well-designed document layouts are built in.

LyX is for people who want their writing to look great, right out of
the box. No more endless tinkering with formatting details, "finger
painting" font attributes or futzing around with page boundaries.
You just write. On screen, LyX looks like any word processor; its
printed output - or richly cross-referenced PDF, just as readily
produced - looks like nothing else.

LyX is a wordprocessor frontend to LaTeX, which gives both the
ease-of-use of a wordprocessor, and the flexibility and power
of LaTeX.

LyX produces high quality, professional output -- using LaTeX, an
industrial strength typesetting engine, in the background; LyX is
far more than a front-end to LaTeX, however. No knowledge of LaTeX
is necessary to use LyX, although it will give a user more power.

LyX is stable and fully featured. It has been used for documents 
as large as a thesis, or as small as a business letter. 
Despite its simple GUI interface (available in many languages), 
it supports tables, figures, and hyperlinked cross-references, and
best-of-breed math editor.

Flavors:
	qt 	- build with a Qt GUI (open-source GPL library)
	xforms 	- build with an XForms GUI (closed-source library)

@Update to version 1.2.3
This release mainly fixes a very bad bug where configuring LyX
as root (never recomended) could lead to deleting the /dev/null
special device.
Also a bug where LyX would create zombie processes has been
fixed.

Quasi-WYSIWYG interface, many LaTeX styles and layouts automatically
generated. Speeds up learning LaTeX and makes complicated layouts
easy and intuitive. 
New features include spell-checking, international character support,
WYSIWYG graphics, tables, and equations.

There are more recent versions, but this is the latest that doesn't
