log
@update LyX to 1.6.6.1, fixing gcc4 build, working better with
Qt4.6, and with many improvements.

worked on by Andreas Kurzegasse, Olivier Cherrier, Daniel Dickman
and with a few tweaks by myself and discussed with Daniel.

@Before using lyx(1), make sure you have `python' in your PATH.
    e.g. ln -sf ${MODPY_BIN} ${PREFIX}/bin/python

1.1
log
@lyx(1) wants `python' or it will die. It should be possible to use
MODPY_BIN instead, but franckly there are python references all over the
code and I don't feel like fixing this right now.
Add a MESSAGE to warn users accordingly.
