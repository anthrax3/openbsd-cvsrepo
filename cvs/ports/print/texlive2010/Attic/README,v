@silence bogus symlinks warnings by using scripts from -base where
possible instead of using all scripts from texmf. Add p5-Tk as a dep of
texmf-docs to allow texdoctk to work. Update README.

@Start hooking up dependencies between various texlive packages. Looks
like we don't need a separate fmtutil.cnf for our subsets this year,
which is a good thing as tl-link-config can go. Packing lists still need
tweaks and -full and -docs have not been touched yet. Top @@xxx
(conflict etc.) directives not touched yet. Some fallout with the new mandoc
stuff will need to be looked at.

Lots more to do; having said that, I was able to compile sample2e.

No OK needed, not yet linked to build.
