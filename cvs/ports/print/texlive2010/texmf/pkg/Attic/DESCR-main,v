@TeXLive is an easy way to get up and running with TeX. It provides a
comprehensive TeX system which includes all the major TeX-related
programs, macro packages, and fonts that are free software, including
support for many languages around the world.

This package contains a teTeX-like subset of the TeXLive texmf.
