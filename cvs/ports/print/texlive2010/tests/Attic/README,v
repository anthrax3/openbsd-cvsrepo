TeX Live Testing
================

* The simple test case is sample2e, distributed in the texmf tree. You can test
  this easily, eg: `pdflatex sample2e` (anywhere on the filesystem, its indexed
  by kpse). Try this with a few common typesetters: pdflatex, latex, xelatex.

* Xelatex: see the ./xelatex-fontspec directory for a good test.

* Xindy: Go and download the xindy tarball and run through the example
  in doc/style-tutorial. Remember that xindy will only run where clisp can; some
  architectures can not have clisp.

* Context: see ./context dir.

* Texdoc: Install texmf-docs and try some doc searches. For example:
  `texdoc beamer` should show the documentation for the beamer package.

* Test some of your own docs. Make sure you open them to check they *look* right,
  not just build
