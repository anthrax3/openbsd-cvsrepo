@silence bogus symlinks warnings by using scripts from -base where
possible instead of using all scripts from texmf. Add p5-Tk as a dep of
texmf-docs to allow texdoctk to work. Update README.

Is anyone testing this?

@Found bogus junk being installed in ${PREFIX}/texmf*. Also showed me
that some symlinks need to be translated. Unfortunately this now causes
symlink warnings during packaging; this is because teh relative symlinks
are bogus in the context of ${WRKINST}, but not once relocated at
install time. Any ideas what to do with that anyone?

Not linked to build, no OK.

log
@Start hooking up dependencies between various texlive packages. Looks
like we don't need a separate fmtutil.cnf for our subsets this year,
which is a good thing as tl-link-config can go. Packing lists still need
tweaks and -full and -docs have not been touched yet. Top @@xxx
(conflict etc.) directives not touched yet. Some fallout with the new mandoc
stuff will need to be looked at.

Lots more to do; having said that, I was able to compile sample2e.

No OK needed, not yet linked to build.

@(a) tweak packing lists for arches xindy will not run on, (b) sort WANTLIB
alphabetically.

At this stage the compilers build on amd64 and sparc64. Need to test on some
more architectures.

log
@Create a "work in progress" directory for texlive 2010. This is not linked to
the build, but will eventually become print/texlive.

There is a README file containing my roadmap and progress.

OK to make this sandbox from sthen@@ and ajacoutot@@.
