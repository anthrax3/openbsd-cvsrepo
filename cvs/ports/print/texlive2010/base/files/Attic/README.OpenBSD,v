@TeX Live for OpenBSD - Notes
$OpenBSD: README.OpenBSD,v 1.2 2010/10/21 15:41:55 edd Exp $
----------------------------

There are a number of texmf trees in the OpenBSD packages:

texmf-minimal:
  A teTeX like tree, suitable for casual TeX users
  who do not need many extra macros or ConTeXt (approx 302MB).

texmf-full:
  Extra macros and ConTeXt support (approx 163MB).

texmf-doc:
  Documentation for all of TeX Live (approx 760MB).

All sizes are compressed package sizes.

The texmf package contents do not overlap.

Individual users may override or add to the tex class and style files
supplied by TeX Live by installing them into ~/texmf. There is no need
to run mktexlsr(1) for a texmf tree in a user's $HOME. You can test the
installation by searching for the files using kpsewhich(1). Eg:

% find $HOME/texmf
/home/edd/texmf
/home/edd/texmf/tex
/home/edd/texmf/tex/latex
/home/edd/texmf/tex/latex/acronym
/home/edd/texmf/tex/latex/acronym/acronym.sty
% kpsewhich acronym.sty
/home/edd/texmf/tex/latex/acronym/acronym.sty

The 'tlmgr' script was disabled in the OpenBSD package. This is because
updating TeX Live in this way will upset the package tools due to
differing file checksums.

Some requirements of TeX Live were not included as dependencies to make the
package less bloated for people who don't need those features.

As far as I know:
* You should install ruby and ImageMagick if you wish to use ConTeXt.
* For texdoctk you will need p5-Tk

If you know more, please mail the package maintainer: <edd@@openbsd.org>

Have fun TeXing.

@Update README.OpenBSD with new package sizes and details on how to do a
TEXMFHOME texmf install. Update the main README with details on what fails for
manual pages -- not sure what do do about this yet. Small cleanups of packing
lists.

No OK needed, not linked to build.

supplied by TeX Live by installing them into ~/.texmf and running
mktexlsr(1) (as themselves). After this you can test the installation by
searching for the files using kpsewhich(1).

Be warned that the package tools manipulate TeX configuration files
(texmf.cnf, fmtutil.cnf, etc.) when adding/deleting texlive related
packages.

1.1.1.1
log
@Create a "work in progress" directory for texlive 2010. This is not linked to
the build, but will eventually become print/texlive.

There is a README file containing my roadmap and progress.

OK to make this sandbox from sthen@@ and ajacoutot@@.
