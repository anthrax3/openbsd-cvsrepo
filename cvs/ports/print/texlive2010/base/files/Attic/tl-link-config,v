1.2
log
@Start hooking up dependencies between various texlive packages. Looks
like we don't need a separate fmtutil.cnf for our subsets this year,
which is a good thing as tl-link-config can go. Packing lists still need
tweaks and -full and -docs have not been touched yet. Top @@xxx
(conflict etc.) directives not touched yet. Some fallout with the new mandoc
stuff will need to be looked at.

Lots more to do; having said that, I was able to compile sample2e.

No OK needed, not yet linked to build.

log
@Create a "work in progress" directory for texlive 2010. This is not linked to
the build, but will eventually become print/texlive.

There is a README file containing my roadmap and progress.

OK to make this sandbox from sthen@@ and ajacoutot@@.
