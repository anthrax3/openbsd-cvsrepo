@Fix up PLISTs.

At one point bsd.port.mk put out erroneous PLIST-auto, with @@cwd, @@pkgname,
and @@pkgdep lines.

These are actually added by make package, and shouldn't usually be put
inside the PLIST, as this is extra information to update.

I left a few @@cwd in, mainly for the perl modules, which want to live under
/usr to work.
