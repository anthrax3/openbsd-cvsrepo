@Update to cups-1.4.6, this version fixes landscape printing, sharing,
and fax issues.

Also merge a patch from upstream to disable multi-part support as
several browsers (notably webkit based ones) do not support it
correctly, this should fix the web interface with these browsers. See
http://www.cups.org/str.php?L3455 for details.
