log
@Unbreak ulpt(4) printing.

Add libusb support. Bring a patch from upstream bug DB that allows for
both ulpt(4) and libusb based devices to work without the need for
separate packages.

Remove the useless rc patch (we provide our own).

Move MESSAGE to README and extend it.

1.1
log
@Update to CUPS 1.2.4, which has lots of improvements over the old version
we had, like better support for foreign languages and the usual plethora
of bugfixes.

tested on various architectures and with various applications that use CUPS
as their printing system.  I verified that all ports that are depending on
CUPS still build.
