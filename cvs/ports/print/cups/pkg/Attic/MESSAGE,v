@Unbreak ulpt(4) printing.

Add libusb support. Bring a patch from upstream bug DB that allows for
both ulpt(4) and libusb based devices to work without the need for
separate packages.

Remove the useless rc patch (we provide our own).

Move MESSAGE to README and extend it.

@If you want to print to non-Postscript printers or use CUPS bundled PPD
files (i.e. drivers), you'll need to install ghostscript.  You will also
most probably want to install the foomatic-filters package which
provides a universal filter script.

@As agreed with espie@@, install a first rc script to serve as a test
example. A couple of things are still missing from the infrastructure
but the basics work. When everything has been taken care of, we'll start
mocing all ports to using the new rc system.

To enable CUPS, execute '${PREFIX}/sbin/cups-enable' as root.
To disable CUPS, execute '${PREFIX}/sbin/cups-disable' as root.

To start cups at boot time, add the following to
/etc/rc.local:

if [ -x ${PREFIX}/sbin/cupsd ]; then
	#chown _cups /dev/ulpt[0-1] # uncomment if using USB printer
	#chown _cups /dev/lp[a,t][0-2] # uncomment if using parallel printer
	echo y | ${PREFIX}/sbin/cups-enable > /dev/null
	echo -n ' cupsd'; ${PREFIX}/sbin/cupsd
fi

Starting cupsd will overwrite /etc/printcap. A backup copy of this file
is saved as /etc/printcap.pre-cups by '${PREFIX}/sbin/cups-enable'
and will be restored when you run '${PREFIX}/sbin/cups-disable'.
