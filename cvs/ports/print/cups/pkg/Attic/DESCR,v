log
@Major update to CUPS 1.6.1.
This package is now split between -main (the bloat) and -libs (i.e.
cups-libs; which only contains the base libraries which have no
external deps).
Most filters have moved to cups-filters, the split was needed because
cups depends on cups-filters which depends on cups

The nice side-effect is that this will simplify lots of things in tree.

@CUPS provides a portable printing layer for UNIX(r)-based
operating systems.  CUPS provides the System V and Berkeley
command-line interfaces.

CUPS uses the Internet Printing Protocol ("IPP") as the basis
for managing print jobs and queues.  The Line Printer Daemon
("LPD") Server Message Block ("SMB"), and AppSocket (a.k.a.
JetDirect) protocols are also supported with reduced
functionality.  CUPS adds network printer browsing and
PostScript Printer Description ("PPD") based printing options to
support real-world printing under UNIX.

Available flavors:

ldap		Enable printer sharing via LDAP
