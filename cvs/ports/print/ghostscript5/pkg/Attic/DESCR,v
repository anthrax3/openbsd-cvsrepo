@This is Aladdin Ghostscript 5.10, the non-GPL version that comes
with a licence different from the GPL. Read the file PUBLIC in the
work/gs5.10 directory or in /usr/local/share/ghostscript/5.10/doc/PUBLIC
after installation for details !

Ghostscript is the well-known PostScript interpreter which is
available for all common and most esoteric platforms and supports
many different printers and some displays.

The official ghostscript Web page:

Thomas Merz has written a Ghostscript manual which is available in
PDF from this site (456k) and also from Thomas Merz's site in Germany.
