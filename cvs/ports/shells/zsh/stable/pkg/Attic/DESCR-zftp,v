@Zsh is a UNIX command interpreter (shell) which of the standard shells
most resembles the Korn shell (ksh), although it is not completely
compatible.  It includes enhancements of many types, notably in the
command-line editor, options for customising its behaviour, filename

extra features drawn from tcsh (another `custom' shell).

This package adds the zftp module to zsh.
