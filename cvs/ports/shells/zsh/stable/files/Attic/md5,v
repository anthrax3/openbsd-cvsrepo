@update zsh/stable to 4.0.4:
--
This is a maintenance release of the stable 4.0 series. A large number
of small bugfixes have been made covering the whole shell. There are
very few user-visible changes, mostly minor enhancements to the
completion function system.

@update zsh/stable to 4.0.1:

- add two new sub-packages, -modules and -zftp which adds dynamically
  loadable modules and an embedded ftp client to zsh.
- static FLAVOR disable all dynamic modules and link statically zsh.

Otherwise:

Zsh is a UNIX command interpreter (shell) which of the standard shells
most resembles the Korn shell (ksh), although it is not completely
compatible.  It includes enhancements of many types, notably in the
command-line editor, options for customizing its behaviour, filename
globbing, features to make C-shell (csh) users feel more at home and
extra features drawn from tcsh (another custom shell).
