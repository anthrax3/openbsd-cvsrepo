@Remove static FLAVORs, some cleanup.

@Bash is the GNU Project's Bourne Again SHell, an sh-compatible
command language interpreter that executes commands read from the
standard input or from a file.  Bash also incorporates useful
features from the Korn and C shells (ksh and csh).

Bash is intended to be a conformant implementation of the IEEE POSIX
Shell and Tools specification (IEEE Working Group 1003.2).

@- Update bash to 3.0: Lots of small changes, i18n support.
- Drop the preformatted print documentation.
- Move back to the shells/bash location.

Flavors:
	static - Build with statically linked binaries.

@Remove bash1 port.  This has been entirely superseded by bash2.
Chet doesn't maintain it any longer.  It smells funny.

Bash is the GNU Project's Bourne Again SHell, an interactive shell with 
Bourne shell syntax (/bin/sh); but also with interactive command line 
editing, job control on architectures that support it, Csh-like history 
features and brace expansion, and a slew of other stuff.  For more 
information on the features of Bash that are new to this type of shell, 
see the file `documentation/features.texi'. There is also a processed DVI 
file there, as well as a large man page.
