@- Update bash to 3.0: Lots of small changes, i18n support.

@
text
@Bash is the GNU Project's Bourne Again SHell, an sh-compatible
command language interpreter that executes commands read from the
standard input or from a file.  Bash also incorporates useful
features from the Korn and C shells (ksh and csh).

Bash is intended to be a conformant implementation of the IEEE POSIX
Shell and Tools specification (IEEE Working Group 1003.2).

Flavors:
	static - Build with statically linked binaries.

Bash is the GNU Project's Bourne Again SHell, an interactive shell
with Bourne shell syntax (/bin/sh);  but also with interactive command
line editing, job control on architectures that support it, Csh-like
history features and brace expansion, and a slew of other stuff.

of shell, see the file `documentation/features.texi'.  There is also a
processed DVI file there, as well as a large man page.
