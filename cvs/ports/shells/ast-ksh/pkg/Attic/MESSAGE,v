@* Update to 2001-10-31.
* Re-enable static flavor.
* Tighten PERMIT_*.  I'm sick of it.  The license is written in
imprenetrable legalese, obviously drafted by corporate lawyers, and
full of bizarre requirements.  I don't care if this can be construed
to be Open Source, it certainly is not in the spirit of Open Source.
* Remove license check and "Proprietary Notice" since we won't distribute
the package.
