@add an optional static flavour to nsh
@
text
@NSH is a CLI intended for OpenBSD-based network appliances. It replaces
ifconfig, sysctl and route with its own simple command language, and
consolidates configuration and control of other daemons into one place,
presenting the user with a vaguely cisco-like interface.

Flavour: static - link statically.

NSH consolidates configuration for interfaces, bridging, routing, PF
packet filtering, NAT, queueing, BGP, OSPF, RIP, IPsec, DHCP, DVMRP,
SNMP, relayd, sshd, inetd, ftp-proxy, resolv.conf and NTP. It presents
the user with a vaguely cisco-like interface with all configuration in
one easy to read text list.
