1.1
log
@Reliability fix:
Buffer overflow in GNU screen allows privilege escalation for local users.
It also has some potential for attackers getting control of another user's
screen.  Transfer of approximately two gigabytes of data is required to
exploit this vulnerability.
Usually screen is installed either setgid-utmp or setuid-root but this DOES
NOT happen on OpenBSD, thus the reliability fix.
