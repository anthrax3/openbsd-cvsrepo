.TH ENT 1

.SH NAME
ent - pseudo random number sequence test

.SH SYNOPSIS
ent [ -b -c -f -t -u ] [ infile ]

.SH DESCRIPTION

Preforms Entropy, Chi-square, Arithmetic Mean, Monte-Carlo-Pi and Serial Correlation tests. 

.SH OPTIONS

.B -b
	The input is treated as a stream of bits rather than bytes.

.B -c
	Print a table of the number of occurrences of each possible byte (or bit, if the -b option is also specified) value, and the fraction of the overall file made up by that value. Printable characters in the ISO 8859-1 Latin-1 character set are shown along with their decimal byte values.

.B -f
	Fold upper case letters to lower case before conducting tests. Folding is done based on the ISO 8859-1 Latin-1 character set.

.B -t
	Terse mode output is written in Comma Separated Value (CSV) format.

.B -u
	Print basic usage information.

.SH FILES

If no infile is specified, ent reads from stdin. Output is always written to stdout. ent processes one infile at a time.

.SS TERSE MODE OUTPUT FORMAT

In Terse mode, row 0 is a header row which identifies the content of row 1. If the -c option is specified, rows 2 and 3, which contain character count information, are appended. If the -b option is specified, only two type 3 rows are shown for bits 0 and 1. Otherwise, 256 type 3 rows are shown, one for each possible byte.

ent - a program which applies various tests (Entropy, Chi-square,
Arithmetic Mean, Monte Carlo Value for Pi, Serial Correlation
Coefficient) to sequences of bytes stored in files and reports the
results of those tests. The program is useful for evaluating pseudo
random number generators for encryption and statistical sampling
applications, compression algorithms, and other applications where the
information density of a file is of interest.
