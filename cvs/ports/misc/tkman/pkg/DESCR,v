@A manual page reader, TkMan offers two major advantages over xman:
hypertext links to other man pages (click on a word in the text which
corresponds to a man page, and you jump there), and better navigation
within long man pages with searches (both incremental and regular
expression) and jumps to section headers.  TkMan also offers some
convenience features, like a user-configurable list of commonly used man
pages, a one-click printout, and integration of `whatis' and `apropos'.
Further, one may highlight, as if with a yellow marker, arbitrary
passages of text in man pages and subsequently jump directly to these
passages by selecting an identifying excerpt from a pulldown menu.
Finally, TkMan gives one control over the directory-to-menu volume
mapping of man pages with a capability similar to but superior to xman's
mandesc in that rather than forcing all who share a man directory to
follow a single organization, TkMan gives control to the individual.  In
fact, one may decide he has no use for a large set of man pages--say for
instance the programmer routines in volumes 2, 3, 4, 8--and eliminate
them from his personal database.
