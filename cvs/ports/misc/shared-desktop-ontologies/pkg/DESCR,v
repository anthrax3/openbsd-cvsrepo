@Update to shared-desktop-ontologies-0.7.1.
@
text
@The shared-desktop-ontologies package brings the semantic web to the
desktop in terms of vocabulary. It contains the well known core
ontologies such as RDF and RDFS as well as the Nepomuk ontologies which
are used by projects like KDE or Strigi.

woah dude. Like, here's some text.

(okay, in reality, this is just stuff kde4 really wants otherwise some
stuff won't build)

The vision of the Social Semantic Desktop defines a user's personal
information environment as a source and end-point of the Semantic
Web: Knowledge workers comprehensively express their information
and data with respect to their own conceptualizations. Semantic Web
languages and protocols are used to formalize these conceptualizations
and for coordinating local and global information access. The
Resource Description Framework RDF serves as a common data
representation format. We identified several additional requirements
for high-level knowledge representation on the social semantic
desktop. With a particular focus on addressing certain limitations
of RDF, we engineered a novel representational language akin to RDF
and the Web Ontology Language OWL, plus a number of other high-level
ontologies. Together, they provide a means to build the semantic
bridges necessary for data exchange and application integration on
distributed social semantic desktops. Although initially designed
to fulfill requirements for the NEPOMUK project, these ontologies
are useful for the semantic web community in general.

@it's small, it's arch-independent, kde4 wants it, and I have absolutely no
idea what the fuck it's actually useful for.
just the page of people standing behind it makes you shiver
(thales, ibm, sap... and others)
