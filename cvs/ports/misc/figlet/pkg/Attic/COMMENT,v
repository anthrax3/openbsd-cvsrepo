1.2
log
@Merge in the duplicate figlet ports (from textproc/ and misc/)

- pkg/COMMENT no longer starts with a capital
- pkg/DESCR uses value of HOMEPAGE
- lots more fonts added to PLIST from contributed.tar.gz
- define DISTNAME to make things cleaner
- patch-aa renamed to patch-figlet
- added patch-figlist to code in default location of fonts
- removed patch-ab since Aaron's port just passes MAKE_FLAGS
- removed FAKE_FLAGS completely and do the install manually
- added HOMEPAGE
- general Makefile cleaning (bump NEED_VERSION etc)
- add RCS ids everywhere that needs them
- take maintainership
