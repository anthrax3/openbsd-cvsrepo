+<B>Caveats</B>:-
+<BR>
+You probably need to have a disc in your CD devices for CD-Rchive to properly 
+detect them.
+<BR>
+CD-Rchive for OpenBSD uses cdrecord(1), vnconfig(8), and mount(8).
+Because of this, unprivileged users on your system may have problems
+using CD-Rchive.  You should evaluate how allowing users to run
+CD-Rchive on your system fits into your security requirements.
+CD-Rchive makes no special attempt to allow users to run cdrecord,
+vnconfig and mount, as security requirements vary greatly from system 
+to system.
+<BR>
+Don't forget to uncheck the "DUMMY WRITE" checkbox on the "Advanced" page
+when you are ready to burn a disc.
