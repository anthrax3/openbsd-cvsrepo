1.4
log
@Turns out tetex dialog is not suitable for anything but tetex.
In particular, XF86Setup complains...

So, fix texconfig to find misc/dialog first, then fall back on teTeX's
dialog.

This removes the teTeX/dialog conflict, repairs XF86Setup.
Installing tetex-dialog as a fall back removes the need for teTeX to
depend on misc/dialog.

Solved by fries@@.

@Fix up PLISTs.

At one point bsd.port.mk put out erroneous PLIST-auto, with @@cwd, @@pkgname,
and @@pkgdep lines.

These are actually added by make package, and shouldn't usually be put
inside the PLIST, as this is extra information to update.

I left a few @@cwd in, mainly for the perl modules, which want to live under
/usr to work.
