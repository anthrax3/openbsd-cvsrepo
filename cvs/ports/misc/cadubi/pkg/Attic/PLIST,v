@Import of cadubi-1.1b1

CADUBI is an application written in Perl that allows you to
draw text-based images that are viewable on typical unix-based
consoles.  Usually the applications that emulate these
consoles support various text modes, such as background and
foreground colors, bold, and inverse.  This text art, commonly
called "ASCII art", is used in various places such as online
BBSes, email and login prompts.
