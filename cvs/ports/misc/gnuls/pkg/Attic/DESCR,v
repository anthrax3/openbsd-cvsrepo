@Bye, bye.

@`gnuls' is a port of the GNU colorized `ls' program--the one most Linux
users are familiar with.  The port was formerly called `linuxls', since it
had been adapted from the colorized Linux version of `ls' -- which, in
turn, was a patched version of GNU's stock `ls' program.  The folks at GNU
have since rolled the colorization mods into their official version of
`ls'; this port's name now reflects that change.

The port installs five programs in `/usr/local/bin': `gnuls', `linuxls'
(for backward compatibility), `dir', `vdir' and `dircolors'.  It also
installs man pages for `gnuls' (but *not* `linuxls') and `dircolors'.

NOTES:

1. This port modifies the GNU `fileutils' make procedure so that it
   installs only programs and man pages listed above.

2. This port installs GNU's `ls' as `gnuls' and `linuxls' so it won't
   conflict with the normal BSD `ls' program or the BSD `colorls' program
   (the latter available from the ports collection).

3. This colorized `ls' program is not the same as the `colorls' program 
   available from the FreeBSD ports collection.
