@sent is a simple plaintext presentation tool.

sent does not need latex, libreoffice or any other fancy file format, it uses
plaintext files and png images. Every paragraph represents a slide in the
presentation.

The presentation is displayed in a simple X11 window. The content of each slide
is automatically scaled to fit the window and centered so you also don't have to
worry about alignment. Instead you can really concentrate on the content.

plaintext files and png images. Currently every paragraph represents a slide in
the presentation. Especially for presentations using the Takahashi method this
is very nice and allows you to write down the presentation for a quick lightning
talk within a few minutes.

The presentation is displayed in a simple X11 window colored black on white for
maximum contrast even if the sun shines directly onto the projected image. The
content of each slide is automatically scaled to fit the window so you don't
have to worry about alignment. Instead you can really concentrate on the
content.
