@gpsd is a service daemon that monitors one or more GPSes attached
to a host computer through serial or USB ports, making all data on
the location/course/velocity of the sensors available to be queried
on TCP port 2947 of the host computer. With gpsd, multiple GPS
client applications (such as navigational and wardriving software)
can share access to GPSes without contention or loss of data. Also,
gpsd responds to queries with a format that is substantially easier
to parse than the NMEA 0183 emitted by most GPSes. The gpsd
distribution includes a linkable C service library, a C++ wrapper
class, and a Python module that developers of gpsd-aware applications
can use to encapsulate all communication with gpsd.

@Gpsd is a client/server setup for talking to GPS units.  It speaks
all the appropriate GPS lingos and (hopefully) can provide a unified
interface to all of them.
