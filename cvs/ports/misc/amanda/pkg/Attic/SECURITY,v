@Remove SECURITY files. They have served their purpose in the past but
have become pretty useless nowadays (and the pkg tools do not display
them anyway).
Some which contained valuable information have been turned into READMEs.

Release 2.4.0 addressed a number of security concerns with the assistance
of Theo de Raadt, Ejovi Nuwere and David Sacerdote of the OpenBSD project.

The backup data is transmitted across the network unencrypted unless you
use kencrypt, IPsec or the gpg flavor.

Kerberos support was present in 2.4.0, but was broken in later releases.
The 2.4.4p2 release addressed some of the problems. The current status of
Kerberos support for this version is unknown.

Kerberos support was present in 2.4.0, but is absent in 2.4.2.  Rumor is
that the 2.4.0 code MAY work with 2.4.2, but the integration has proved
to be difficult.
Kerberos support should return in 2.5.0.

There is work in progress to use gpg to encrypt the dump traffic:
