@  DejaGnu is a framework for testing other programs. Its purpose is to
provide a single front end for all tests.  Beyond this, DejaGnu offers
several advantages for testing:

        - The flexibility and consistency of the DejaGnu framework
          make it easy to write tests for any program.

        - DejaGnu provides a layer of abstraction which makes all
          tests (if correctly written) portable to any host or target
          where a program must be tested.  For instance, a test for
          GDB can run (from any Unix based host) on any target
          architecture supported by DejaGnu. Currently DejaGnu runs
          tests on several single board computers, whose operating
          software ranges from just a boot monitor to a full-fledged,
          Unix-like realtime OS.

        - DejaGnu is written in expect, which in turn uses Tcl
          (Tool command language).  The framework comprises two parts:
          the testing framework and the testsuites themselves. Tests
          are usually written in expect using Tcl.
