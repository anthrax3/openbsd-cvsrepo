@Argh! I shouldn't have stop reading at the `ok william@@' line ;-

Tweak COMMENT, zap COPYING and CHANGES, and apply proper military look to do-install,
as suggested by william@@.

@tpp stands for text presentation program and is an ncurses-based
presentation tool. The presentation can be written with your favorite
editor in a simple description format and then shown on any text
terminal that is supported by ncurses - ranging from an old VT100
to the Linux framebuffer to an xterm.
