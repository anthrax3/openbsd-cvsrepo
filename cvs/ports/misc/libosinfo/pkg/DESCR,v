@libosinfo is a GObject based library API for managing information about
operating systems, hypervisors and the (virtual) hardware devices they
can support. It includes a database containing device metadata and
provides APIs to match/identify optimal devices for deploying an
operating system on a hypervisor.

Via the magic of GObject Introspection, the API is available in all
common programming languages with demos for javascript (GJS/Seed) and
python (PyGObject). Also provided are Vala bindings.
