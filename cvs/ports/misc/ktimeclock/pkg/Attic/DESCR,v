@KTimeclock is a personal timeclock to keep track of how much time is 
spent working on various projects and the tasks that they involve.
Simply set up a series of projects, each of which can contain multiple 
sub-projects and tasks; select the current task that you're working on;
start the clock; and KTimeclock will track the time you've spent working 
on that task.
