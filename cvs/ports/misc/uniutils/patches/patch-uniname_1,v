log
@Fix a documentation formatting bug that made part of the text
incomprehensible with both groff and mandoc.
Issue found because naddy@@ reported that mandoc complains about another
bug (unknown macro) in just the same sentence - correcting this, too.
While here, remove USE_GROFF and add @@comment bin/utf8lookup.  Bump.
OK nicm@@ (MAINTAINER)

@$OpenBSD$
The order of lines got mixed up, making the text incomprehensible.
While here, fix the case of the .PP macro or it won't work
and remove a .br that has no effect.
