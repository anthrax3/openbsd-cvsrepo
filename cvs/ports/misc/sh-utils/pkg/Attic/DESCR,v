@These ports have been unhooked for a while and replaced by coreutils, so

@sh-utils is a package of small shell programming utilities. They
are mostly compliant with POSIX.2, where applicable. The programs
that can be built with this package are basename, chroot, date,
dirname, echo, env, expr, factor, false, groups, hostname, id,
logname, nice, nohup, pathchk, printenv, printf, pwd, seq, sleep,
stty, tee, test, true, tty, uname, users, who, whoami, and yes.

su is not installed with this package.

All the binaries are prefixed by the letter g to differentiate them
with the standard applications with the same name.  `id' is prefixed
by two g (ggid) in other to avoid a conflict with gid in id-utils.

@since we got a conflict with id-utils regarding the name gid, rename that
binary to ggid.  pointed out by espie@@
