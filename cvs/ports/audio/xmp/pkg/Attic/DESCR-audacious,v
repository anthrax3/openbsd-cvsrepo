Various fixes following audacious' update.

- For audacious:

devel/mcs is no longer a dependency

"--disable-sse2" configure flag no longer exists

libexecinfo is useless (backtrace() isn't used anywhere)

fix libpthread linkage ("-lpthread" -> "-pthread")

fix WANTLIB

- For audacious-plugins:

zap jack subpackage, since now Jack2>=1.9.7 is required

remove configure flags that no longer exist

do not pick hidden dependencies up if they're installed

fix libpthread linkage ("-lpthread" -> "-pthread")

fix configure failing to correctly detect required libraries due
to undefined references (wrong linking)

pass "--disable-ffaudio" to configure since it wants a ffmpeg newer
than the one we have

fix WANTLIB and CONFIGURE_ENV

- For xmp:

zap audacious subpackage: it's broken beyond any repair with audacious-3.2
