1.1
log
@Update schismtracker to 20160521 and take maintainership.

- Project moved to GitHub so fetch distfile from there
- Changed comment to a more accurate description
- Release tarball doesn't bundle a configure script, so the port now
  uses autoconf + automake, with patched configure.ac (comment in file)
- Use upstream Makefile install target, as it also installs manpage

OK jung@@
