1.2
log
@Update schismtracker to 20160913.

Among other things, this update fixes log2() function detection and
doesn't attempt to link against libdl, so we can shorten one of the
patches and drop the other.

1.1
log
@Update schismtracker to 20160521 and take maintainership.

- Project moved to GitHub so fetch distfile from there
- Changed comment to a more accurate description
- Release tarball doesn't bundle a configure script, so the port now
  uses autoconf + automake, with patched configure.ac (comment in file)
- Use upstream Makefile install target, as it also installs manpage
