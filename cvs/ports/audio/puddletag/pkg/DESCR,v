@Mention that chromaprint can be installed to use the AcoustID database
for tracks fingerprinting so that tags are automatically filled.
Not added to RDEP as it adds ffmpeg as a dependency.

@puddletag is an audio tag editor similar to the Windows program, Mp3tag.
It uses a spreadsheet-like layout so that all the tags you want to edit
by hand are visible and easily editable.
Tagging your files can be supported by the AcoustID library, which
creates digital fingerprints from your files and uses them to search the
tag database. To enable this feature, install chromaprint.
