@Update to mad-0.14.1b

Highlights:
* Added a new ID3 tag manipulation library (libid3tag).
* Fixed a possible segmentation fault due to mmap() abuse.
* Added a 64-bit FPM negation operation to improve performance of subband
  synthesis on some platforms.
* Added rounding to Layer III requantization for slightly better accuracy.
* Modified the PCM dithering routine for better dithered output.
* Added TTY controls and new --tty-control and --no-tty-control options to
  `madplay'. TTY control keys: `P' pause, `S' stop, `Q' quit, `F' forward,
  `B' backward.

@Import of mad-0.13.0b

MAD is a high-quality MPEG audio decoder. It currently supports
MPEG-1 as well as the MPEG-2 extension to Lower Sampling
Frequencies. All three audio layers (Layer I, Layer II, and Layer
III a.k.a. MP3) are fully implemented.

MAD does not yet support MPEG-2 multichannel audio (although it
should be backward compatible with such streams) or AAC, nor does
it support the so-called MPEG 2.5 format.

MAD has the following special features:

  - 24-bit PCM output - 100% fixed-point (integer) computation -
  completely new implementation based on the ISO/IEC standards -
  distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License
  (GPL)

The software is distributed as a library (libmad) and
command-line front-end (madplay).
