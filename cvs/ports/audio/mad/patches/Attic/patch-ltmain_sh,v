@Import of mad-0.13.0b

MAD is a high-quality MPEG audio decoder. It currently supports
MPEG-1 as well as the MPEG-2 extension to Lower Sampling
Frequencies. All three audio layers (Layer I, Layer II, and Layer
III a.k.a. MP3) are fully implemented.

MAD does not yet support MPEG-2 multichannel audio (although it
should be backward compatible with such streams) or AAC, nor does
it support the so-called MPEG 2.5 format.

MAD has the following special features:

  - 24-bit PCM output - 100% fixed-point (integer) computation -
  completely new implementation based on the ISO/IEC standards -
  distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License
  (GPL)

The software is distributed as a library (libmad) and
command-line front-end (madplay).
