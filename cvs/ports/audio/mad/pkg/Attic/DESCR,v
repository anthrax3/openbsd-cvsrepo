@MAD is a high-quality MPEG audio decoder. It currently supports
MPEG-1 as well as the MPEG-2 extension to Lower Sampling
Frequencies. All three audio layers (Layer I, Layer II, and Layer
III a.k.a. MP3) are fully implemented.

MAD does not yet support MPEG-2 multichannel audio (although it
should be backward compatible with such streams) or AAC, nor does
it support the so-called MPEG 2.5 format.

MAD has the following special features:

  - 24-bit PCM output - 100% fixed-point (integer) computation -
  completely new implementation based on the ISO/IEC standards -
  distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License
  (GPL)

The software is distributed as a library (libmad) and
command-line front-end (madplay).

Additionally, packages can be built with "debug" flavor to enable
debugging and "esd" flavor for EsounD support.

@Update to mad-0.14.2b
- Added esd flavor, adding esound support to madplay
- Added -b (--bit-depth) option and -i (--ignore-crc) option to madplay
- Added a new mad_stream_errorstr() API function to libmad for retrieving
a string description of the current error condition.
- Changed the audio_wave module to initially write ~0 length rather than
0, for better compatibility when output is piped to another program.
