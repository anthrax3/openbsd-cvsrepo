@Warn users and porters about the experimental nature of CELT and
the fact that it has now been deprecated in favor of the IETF Opus
codec.

From a discussion with sthen@@

@The CELT codec is an experimental audio codec for use in low-delay
speech and audio communication. It's meant to close the gap between
Vorbis and Speex for applications where both high quality audio and
low delay are desired.

Note that the CELT codec has been merged into the IETF Opus codec
(http://opus-codec.org/) and is now considered obsolete.
