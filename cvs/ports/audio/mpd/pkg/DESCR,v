@Music Player Daemon allows remote access for playing music (MP3,
Ogg, FLAC, AAC, Mod and WAV files) and managing playlists. MPD is
designed for integrating a computer into a stereo system that
provides control for music playback over a local network.  It also
makes a great desktop music player and has several frontend options.

tremor:	Use the tremor integer-only Vorbis decoder. This disables
	the use of the FLAC codec within Ogg containers and the
