@Update to mpd 0.16.2:
Diff from Martin Pieuchot based on a diff for 0.16.1 from Tobias Ulmer
(maintainer). Note that configuration file may need an update
(mixer_type is not global anymore, it's per-output), and mpd will
recreate its database upon startup.
Tested by jasper@@ and myself, looks good to maintainer
