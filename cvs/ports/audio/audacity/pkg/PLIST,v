@- update audacity to latest version: 1.3.3
- add NO_REGRESS since regression tests have not been updated for more
than 3 years and upstream does not seem interested
- add a patch from deanna@@ that makes audacity use portaudio v19 and
make full duplex work (well sort of, but at least it does not hang
anymore)

@initial import of audacity-1.2.4

Audacity is a free audio editor. You can record sounds, play sounds,
import and export WAV, AIFF, Ogg Vorbis, and MP3 files, and more. Use it
to edit your sounds using Cut, Copy and Paste (with unlimited Undo), mix
tracks together, or apply effects to your recordings.

Initial port and many patches by jakemsr@@. Thanks to maintainer
Antoine Jacoutot for persistence and keeping the port alive.
