log
@* Update to SoX 14.4.2
* Remove cherry-picked patches as they are included now.
* Drop --without-ffmpeg as ffmpeg has finally been kicked out.
* Add the newly supported Opus format (--with-opus)
* Addresses some more ./configure --options explicitly.
* While there, reorder the LIB_DEPENDS alphabetically.
        and reorder WANTLIB by LIB_DEPENDS

@$OpenBSD: patch-src_wav_c,v 1.1 2014/12/29 10:44:55 sthen Exp $

[f39c57] More checks for invalid MS ADPCM blocks.

If block doesn't exacty match blockAlign then do not allow
number of samples in invalid size block to ever be more than
what WAV header defined as samplesPerBlock.
