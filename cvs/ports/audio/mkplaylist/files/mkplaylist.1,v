1.1.1.1
log
@import mkplaylist:

The script scans the given directories for media files with known file
name extensions and writes the names into a playlist file in M3U,
extended M3U or PLS format. Those very simple formats are used or at
least understood by the vast majority of media players on different
platforms.

For huge collections which have to be rescanned after adding or
modifying some files, the program can cache the meta data to speed up
subsequent runs.
