@- update to faad-2.6.1
- greatly simplify type-mismatch-correcting patches.  most of the
  mismatches actually match on size and signedness, so only fix the
  ones that don't match.  tested to work on sparc64 by naddy@@ a
  while back.
- libmp4v2 is no longer part of this package

@problem:
libfaad uses data types with machine dependent bit width in
prototypes in its public headers, but in the corresponding library
code, machine independent exact width data types are used.

solution:
change libfaad headers to use the same machine independent exact
width data types in the prototypes as in the library.  since the
prototypes in the library headers are changed, users of libfaad
likely need to be modified to use exact width data types as well.

also:
- bump libfaad major version number
- update plugin code to use exact width data types for libfaad
  interaction, as per new prototypes
- bump package version
- sync patches with update-patches


problem discovered by, solution discussed with, reviewed, tested
and OK naddy@@
