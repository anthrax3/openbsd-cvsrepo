@   MPEG3 player graphical interface, version 1.0

0 Copyright

	This program is free for you to copy, modify, under the terms of the
GNU Public Licence (GPL).

	The random number generation routine was taken from somewhere I don't
remember, bu it wasn't written by me.

I To make it work:

	You need the program "AMP" to make this player work...
	xmpeg3 works well with tk4.1 and tcl7.5

	xmpeg3 was written with Visual Tcl.

II Launch it

     To launch the program, simply type "wish xmpeg3 &"
     You can use the tcl/tk interpreter you want, for example wishstep, which
looks very good with this player.

III Functions:

	xmpeg3 opens a window. Choose  "Browse" in the "File" menu. 
	You can then browse into your directories. When a file with the ".mp3"
extension appears, double-click on it to play...
	You can select multiple files, then press "Play".

III Advanced operation:

	The "Rplay" (Random Play) button allows you to play the selected files in random order.

	You can also use "tracks.idx" files like the one given in example.
Simply put such a file in a directory, it's easy to understand how it works.


IV Known bugs:

	- Needs a man page... 
	- The link between amp and xmpeg3 is not very clean:
		* Sometimes xmpeg3 stops with no reason after a track...
	- The random number generation routine is not very efficient...
