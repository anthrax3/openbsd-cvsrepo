-QQQQ: SoundTracker complains about not being able to open /dev/dsp.
-
-a: Either you have not configured a sound driver for your system (you
-could check that by running an MP3 player or something) - or you are
-running GNOME and your soundcard is kept busy by the E Sound Daemon,
-which you can get rid of by using "killall esd" in a shell.
-
-There's also an "ESD" driver in the Audio settings, but it's not
-possible to do any serious tracking work because of the delay
-introduced by it.
-
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
-
-QQQQ: SoundTracker crashes as soon as I use the menu bar.
-
-a: You have a too old gtk+. Read the INSTALL file.
-
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 QQQQ: The sound output gets quite choppy under machine load.
 
-a1: Don't run the compiled executable directly, but do a full 'make
-install', this installs the executable setuid root and the audio
-thread gets a much higher priority. Read the notes in the INSTALL file
-about this subject.
+a1: Assign the soundtracker process a higher user priority (renice).
 
 a2: Increase size of mixer buffer in the Preferences section.
 
@@@@ -47,9 +19,6 @@@@ scopes.
 
 a5: Reduce scopes and patterns update frequency in the Preferences
 section.
-
-a6: Install at least glibc2.1.1pre3, this fixed a strange sound bug
-for me.
