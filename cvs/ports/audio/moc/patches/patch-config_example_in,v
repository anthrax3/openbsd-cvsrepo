1.1.1.1
log
@MOC (music on console) is a console audio player for LINUX/UNIX designed to be
powerful and easy to use.

MOC plays smoothly, regardless of system or I/O load because it uses the output
buffer in a separate thread. It provides gapless playback because the next file
to be played is precached while the current file is playing.

Supported file formats are: MP3, Ogg Vorbis, FLAC, Musepack (mpc), Speex, Opus,
WAVE, those supported by FFmpeg/LibAV (e.g., WMA, RealAudio, AAC, MP4), AIFF,
AU, SVX, Sphere Nist WAV, IRCAM SF, Creative VOC, SID, wavpack.
