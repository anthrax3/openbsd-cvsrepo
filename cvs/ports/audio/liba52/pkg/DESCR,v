@Update liba52 to 0.7.5-cvs snapshot. This was intended to be the 0.7.5
release but uptream project is essentially dead and the fixes and
improvements since 0.7.4 are worth getting in.

@It is a free library for decoding ATSC A/52 streams, aka AC-3. The
A/52 standard is used in a variety of applications, e.g., digital
television and DVD.

@build a shared version too.  gets x11/vlc closer to working on macppc.
bump PKGNAME.

XXX doesn't respect CFLAGS, installing liba52.txt might be useful.

"No accelerated IMDCT transform found", an annoying message I have been
wondering about for awhile, stems from not using an fft library.  Seems
they only support djb's one, which in typical style, is unlicensed.
(http://cr.yp.to/djbfft.html).  Mentioned here as TODO for advocating or
adding support of another fft library.
