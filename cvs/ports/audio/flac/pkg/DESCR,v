@Update to FLAC 1.2.0.  Many improvements.
@
text
@FLAC is an Open Source lossless audio codec.

FLAC is comprised of
* libFLAC, a library which implements reference encoders and
  decoders for native FLAC and Ogg FLAC, and a metadata interface
* libFLAC++, a C++ object wrapper library around libFLAC
* flac, a command-line program for encoding and decoding files
* metaflac, a command-line program for viewing and editing FLAC
  metadata
* user and API documentation

@Update to 1.1.2:
* better Ogg FLAC support
* speedups
* several new options to flac and metaflac
* several API additions
* streaming support in the XMMS plugin
* bugfixes

* libOggFLAC and libOggFLAC++, which provide encoders and
  decoders for FLAC streams in an Ogg container

FLAC stands for Free Lossless Audio Codec. The FLAC project consists of: 
- the stream format
- libFLAC, a library which implements a reference encoder, stream decoder,
  and file decoder
- flac, which is a command-line wrapper around libFLAC to encode and
  decode .flac files
- input plugins for various music players (Winamp, XMMS, and more in the
  works)

What FLAC is:
- FLAC is patent free.
- FLAC is lossless.
- FLAC is designed to compress audio data.
- The compression capabilities of FLAC are extendable.
- The currently implemented compression methods in the reference encoder
  yield streams smaller than shorten.
- FLAC is asymmetric in favor of decode speed.
- FLAC is suitable for archiving.
- FLAC is suitable for streaming.
- FLAC supports fast sample-accurate seeking.
- FLAC has an extendable metadata system.

@Import of flac 0.8.

flac is a free lossless audio codec.  It does not compete with
MP3/OggVorbis, which are lossy compression schemes.  Instead, flac
can be considered an equivalent to gzip/bzip2, optimized for audio
recordings (wav files).
