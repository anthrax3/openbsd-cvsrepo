@update to nap-1.4.4-ps7
*) enable separate build, change version managing style
*) remove pkg/MESSAGE and unneded patches
*) better DESCR
*) bump NEED_VERSION
Brief Changelog:
- After asking you for the needed information, nap now creates the
  .napconf file automatically.  No sample distfile anymore.
- Added some keybindings for the main window.
- Fixed Ctrl-C so that it can break a nested loop; Ctrl-L so it really
  redraws the whole screen from scratch.

@By default the configuration file .napconf must be in your
home directory.  The program does not create this file.  For
an example see: ${PREFIX}/share/examples/nap/nap.conf.dist

log
@update to nap-1.4.4-ps-2

The nap isn't really maintained by the real author anymore.  Instead,
there is another project which aims to continue the original author's
idea.  The new version is A LOT more stable, with various new fixes and
improvements.
The homepage is http://theory.stanford.edu/~selinger/nap/

Quick changelog with the main things:
- fixed a security bug (string format attack)
  ( http://www.shmoo.com/mail/bugtraq/sep00/msg00942.shtml )
- added --user, --pass, --email, --upload, --download, --dataport,
  --connection, --maxusers options to override settings in config file.
- look for config and library files in user's home directory, rather
  than current directory. Also, renamed these files more discreetly as
  .napconf and .nap_shared.
- fixed several memory leaks and null pointer bugs.

NOTES on OpenBSD post-installation of GNU napster client v1.4:

By default the configuration file (nap.conf) must be in the
working dir, where you invoke the program from.

For an example see ${PREFIX}/share/examples/nap/nap.conf.dist

log
@A simple curses implementation of the napster client,
originally written for windows.
 
Napster is a great tool for exploring and experiencing
artists and music you've never heard before, using protocol
for sharing MP3 files between users. With Napster, the files
stay on the user machine, never passing through the server.
 
The server has the ability to search for particular files,
initializing direct transfer between the clients.
