@Unbreak Clementine build in wild environment (i.e., outta of my laptop):

  * Better handling of libexecinfo. I moved from adding some goo to
    CMakeLists.txt to writing proper FindExecinfo.cmake package.
  * Force source directory, or visualization presets could miss
    installation;
  * Force "plist" in WANTLIB, as it's being used by plugin;
  * Add back fftw3 dependency: while we use external libchromaprint now,
    fftw3 is also needed for so called "moodbar".
  * Nit: remove libnjb, it's use was actually gone in the last release;

Lots of input from sthen@@ and nigel@@, committing ASAP.
