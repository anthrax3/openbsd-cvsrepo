Optional plugins
================
This package includes several optional plugins for beets; they need to be
enabled by adding the name to the 'plugins:' line in your config.yaml file,
and many require additional packages to be installed.

Here are a few common examples.

discogs: The discogs plugin extends the autotagger's search capabilities
to include matches from the Discogs database. Add 'discogs' to the plugins:
line in ~/.config/beets/config.yaml. You will need to login and obtain an
OAuth token for Discogs; if updating from an older version and this no
longer works, you may need to "rm ~/.config/beets/discogs_token.json"
and login again.

chroma: This plugin is for acoustic fingerprinting. Install py-acoustid
and add 'chroma' to the plugins: line.

replaygain: This plugin adds support for ReplayGain, a technique for
normalizing audio playback levels. Install the mp3gain or aacgain packages
and add 'replaygain' to the plugins: line.

web: The web plugin lets your browse and listen to your library through
an HTML5 compatible browser. Install the py-flask package and add 'web'
to the plugins: line.

See http://beets.readthedocs.org/en/latest/plugins/ for a complete list.

@update to beets 1.3.8

force a dependency on audio/py-discogs-client with a minimum version.
it's optional (only used by the discogs plugin) but the dep chain isn't
too bad and it's more userfriendly to prevent attempts to run it with
the old-API version that won't work.

The purpose of beets is to get your music collection right once and for
all. It catalogs your collection, automatically improving its metadata
as it goes using the MusicBrainz database. Then it provides a bouquet of
tools for manipulating and accessing your music.

Features include:

- Fetch or calculate metadata: album art, lyrics, genres, tempos,
ReplayGain levels, or acoustic fingerprints.

- Get metadata from MusicBrainz, Discogs, or Beatport. Or guess metadata
using songs' filenames or their acoustic fingerprints.

- Transcode audio.

- Check your library for duplicate tracks and albums or for albums
that are missing tracks.

- Browse your music library graphically through a Web browser and play
it in any browser that supports HTML5 Audio.
