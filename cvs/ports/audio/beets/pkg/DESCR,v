@The purpose of beets is to get your music collection right once and for
all. It catalogs your collection, automatically improving its metadata
as it goes using the MusicBrainz database. Then it provides a bouquet of
tools for manipulating and accessing your music.

If you plan to use plugins, please make sure that you have all necessary
dependencies installed.

Features include:

- Fetch or calculate metadata: album art, lyrics, genres, tempos,
ReplayGain levels, or acoustic fingerprints.

- Get metadata from MusicBrainz, Discogs, or Beatport. Or guess metadata
using songs' filenames or their acoustic fingerprints.

- Transcode audio.

- Check your library for duplicate tracks and albums or for albums
that are missing tracks.

- Browse your music library graphically through a Web browser and play
it in any browser that supports HTML5 Audio.
