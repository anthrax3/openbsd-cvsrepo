@Update to fookebox 0.7.3.

Remove py-sqlalchemy from dependencies, it's been unused since 0.7.x
branch. No need for py-formencode as it's a dependency of py-pylons.

Update default config.ini and README.

@import fookebox-0.6.1

fookebox is a jukebox-style web-frontend to mpd.

- Use as a keyboard-less jukebox frontend
- Or as a powerful mpd control frontend
- Also great for parties with only part-time jukebox
