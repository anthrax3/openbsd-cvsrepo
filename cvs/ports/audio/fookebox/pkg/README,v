@Update to fookebox 0.7.3.

Remove py-sqlalchemy from dependencies, it's been unused since 0.7.x
branch. No need for py-formencode as it's a dependency of py-pylons.

Update default config.ini and README.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------
| Running ${FULLPKGNAME} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Configuration
=============

After having installed the package some steps are needed to setup a
WSGI enabled server for fookebox.

A sample configuration has been generated and installed into
${SYSCONFDIR}/fookebox/config.ini. If you ever need to regenerate,
please use the command below:

	paster make-config fookebox ${SYSCONFDIR}/fookebox/config.ini

Now setup the application:

       paster setup-app ${SYSCONFDIR}/fookebox/config.ini

Now run the server:

	paster serve ${SYSCONFDIR}/fookebox/config.ini

By default a server will now be listening on:

	http://127.0.0.1:5000

Alternatively you may want to use a different webserver to serve
Fookebox, for example py-gunicorn.

For further details on configuring fookebox please have refer to
${PREFIX}/share/doc/fookebox/config.txt

sqlalchemy.url line to ensure an abolute path to the database by using
four slashes in the URI. Now setup the application:

@import fookebox-0.6.1

fookebox is a jukebox-style web-frontend to mpd.

- Use as a keyboard-less jukebox frontend
- Or as a powerful mpd control frontend
- Also great for parties with only part-time jukebox
