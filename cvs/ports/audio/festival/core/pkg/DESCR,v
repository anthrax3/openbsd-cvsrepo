@Festival offers a general framework for building speech synthesis
systems as well as including examples of various modules.  As a whole it
offers full text to speech through a number of APIs.  Festival is
multi-lingual (currently English, Welsh and Spanish) though English is
the most advanced.

Please note that this port does not include any default voices and will
not properly function until an appropriate voice is installed.
