@Paulstrecth is a program for stretching audio. It is suitable only for
extreme sound stretching of the audio (like 50x) and for applying
special effects by "spectral smoothing" the sounds. It can transform any
sound or music into a texture.

Features:

* It produces high quality extreme sound stretching. While most sound
stretching software sounds bad when trying to stretch the sounds a lot,
this one is optimized for extreme sound stretching. So, the stretch
amount is unlimited.

* You can play the stretched sound in real-time (including the
possibility to "freeze" the sound) or you can render the whole sound or
a part of it to audio files.

* It has many post-processing effects, like: filters, pitch/frequency
shifters.

* Support for WAV, OGG VORBIS files and MP3 files
