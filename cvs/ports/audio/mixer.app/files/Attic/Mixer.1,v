.Dt MIXER.APP 1
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm Mixer.app
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm Mixer.app
.Sh Hints for Mixer.app

.Sh Error led:
If the led on Mixer.app is red an error message has
been printed to stderr and something is not working
correctly. If the led is green everything is working ok.

.Sh Mute:
Right click on a volume controller to mute the sound
source. The button will then have a red led in one corner.
Right click again to restore the volume. If a muted sound
source is modified by another application Mixer.app will
automaticaly release its muted state.

.Sh Wheel mouse:
If you have a wheel mouse (where the wheel is configured as
Button4 and Button5) you can control the volume by just moving
the mouse over Mixer.app and roll the wheel up and down. Use
the command line option -w to specify which slider that should
react to the wheel movement.

.Sh Label:
If you run multiple instances of Mixer.app you might want
to be able to tell them apart. This can easily be done
by setting a label to each one of them. By using the -l
option you can add a little text label at the bottom of
the mixer.

.Sh Save volume settings:
Use the option -s or -S <file> if you want the volume
settings to be saved when Mixer.app exits, and then
loaded again when Mixer.app is started the next time.
When using -s the settings are saved in/loaded from
~/GNUstep/Defaults/Mixer. Use the -S <file> option
if you want to use a different file.
