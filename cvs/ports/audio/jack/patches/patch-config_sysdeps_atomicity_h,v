import jack (jack-audio-connection-kit)

JACK is a low-latency audio server, written for POSIX conformant
operating systems. It can connect a number of different applications to
an audio device, as well as allowing them to share audio between
themselves. Its clients can run in their own processes (ie. as normal
applications), or can they can run within the JACK server (ie. as a
"plugin").

JACK was designed from the ground up for professional audio work, and
its design focuses on two key areas: synchronous execution of all
clients, and low latency operation.
