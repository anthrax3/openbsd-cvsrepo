@sndio_driver.c:
- make it work with 24-bit formats (as with azalia and envy)
- use the correct member of struct sio_par for the buffer size
- check both poll(2) revents as well as calculated buffer positions
to know when we can read/write data
sun_driver.c:
- make it work with 24-bit formats (as with azalia and envy)
jackd/engine.c:
- don't spam error messages every time a client quits
add README.OpenBSD

@- update to 0.116.1, mostly stability/reliability fixes
- add sndio backend

playback under aucat server is pretty solid.  for full-duplex,
starting aucat with 'aucat -l -b 2048' and jackd with just
'jackd -d sndio' seems to work best for me.  we want low latency
anyway, right ;)

update to 0.111.2.1169

- don't bother trying to fix compiler optimization flag tests.  they're
badly broken/linux spcific, and we don't use them anyway.
- the net source client became a "real" client (executable), instead of
an "in process" client (plugin)
- previous sun_driver patches accepted upstream, plus:
* fix cycle timing in duplex mode by moving calculations and function
calls out of the poll() synchronization loop
* shorten xrun and silence writing/reading messages
* remove unused variables
* attempt to stop continuous playback underruns in duplex mode that are
caused by the capture buffer overrunning
* try harder to make sure we have pristine buffers after
sun_driver_start()
* use native endian audio encodings
* report a delay when poll() times out, instead of effectively running
a null cycle


now jack works on my r10k sgi :)

import jack (jack-audio-connection-kit)

JACK is a low-latency audio server, written for POSIX conformant
operating systems. It can connect a number of different applications to
an audio device, as well as allowing them to share audio between
themselves. Its clients can run in their own processes (ie. as normal
applications), or can they can run within the JACK server (ie. as a
"plugin").

JACK was designed from the ground up for professional audio work, and
its design focuses on two key areas: synchronous execution of all
clients, and low latency operation.
