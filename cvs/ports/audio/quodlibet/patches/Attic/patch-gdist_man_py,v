Quod Libet is a GTK+-based audio player written in Python, using the Mutagen
tagging library. It's designed around the idea that you know how to organize
your music better than we do. It lets you make playlists based on regular
expressions (don't worry, regular searches work too). It lets you display
and edit any tags you want in the file, for all the file formats it supports.

Unlike some, Quod Libet will scale to libraries with tens of thousands
of songs. It also supports most of the features you'd expect from a modern
media player: Unicode support, advanced tag editing, Replay Gain, podcasts
& internet radio, album art support and all major audio formats.

If you're just looking for a tag editor without the player, Ex Falso
and operon are also included; these are GUI and command-line tag editors
using the same back-end as Quod Libet.
