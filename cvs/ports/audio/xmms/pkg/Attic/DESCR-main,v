@remove xmms, it's been unmaintained for years and it's in the way of
the removal of gtk+1, the toolkit from eons ago.

@X Multimedia System is a sound player written from scratch. Since it
uses the WinAmp GUI, it can use WinAmp skins. It can play mp3s, mods,
s3ms and other formats. It has support for input, output, general, and
visualization plugins.

Note that you need to install the following subpackages to gain
the appropriate functionality:
	-mikmod	to play modules from XMMS through the MikMod library
	-mp3	to play MP3/MPEG 1/2 audio files and HTTP streams
	-vorbis	to play OGG audio files and HTTP streams
