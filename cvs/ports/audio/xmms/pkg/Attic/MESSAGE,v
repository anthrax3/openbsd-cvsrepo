@Update to xmms-1.2.6.  From maintainer vedge@@csoft.org

Added mikmod & diskwriter subpackages.

To use native audio, pick the Sun output plugin in the XMMS
preferences window (ctrl-p).

Depending on your audio hardware and driver, you may want to
fine-tune the buffer size in audio preferences. Usually you
should decrease the buffer size if your hardware can handle it.

Please direct issues regarding the Sun output driver to the
author, ${MAINTAINER}.

To go easier on resources, don't use the `scope' visualization mode, and
increasing the buffer size in audio preferences significantly might help.
If all else fails, use renice(8) on XMMS. Enabling the `XMMS uses mixer
exclusively' option may be of some help on extremely slow systems.
