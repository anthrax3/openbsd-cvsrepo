@gtk+2 -> gtk+3

@This package contains a "glue" library that makes it easier to use
libcanberra from gtk+3 applications and provides a gtk+3 module that
uses libcanberra-gtk3 to trigger input feedback event sounds.

log
@MULTIPACKAGE this port into:
    -main, the main libcanberra library
    -gtk, libcanberra-gtk (gtk+2)
    -gtk3 libcanberra-gtk3 (gtk+3)

This is needed for the ongoing GNOME3 work without forcing a global move
to gtk+3. The -gtk subpackage may disappear in the future when nothing
uses it.

This move will prevent the login/logout sounds to work in
gnome-session-2.X but it is a necessary evil to move forward.
