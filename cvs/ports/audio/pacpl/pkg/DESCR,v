@Remove Bonk, an experimental audio codec that never saw wide adoption.
Last release 12 years ago, superseded by the likes of FLAC and WavPack.

@Perl Audio Converter is a tool for converting multiple audio types from
one format to another. It supports MP2, MP3, Ogg Vorbis, FLAC, Shorten,
Monkey Audio, FAAC (AAC/M4A/MP4), Musepack (MPC), Wavpack (WV),
OptimFrog (OFR/OFS), TTA, LPAC, Kexis (KXS), AIFF, AC3, Lossless Audio (LA),
AU, SND, RAW, VOC, SMP, RealAudio (RA/RAM), WAV, and WMA.

It can also convert audio from the following video formats/extensions:
RM, RV, ASF, DivX, MPG, MKV, MPEG, AVI, MOV, OGM, QT, VCD, VOB, FLV, and WMV.

A CD ripping function with CDDB support, batch and playlist conversion,
daemon mode for converting files on the fly, tag preservation for most
supported formats, independent tag reading/writing, and extensions for
konqueror and amarok are also provided.

To enable the PAC plugin in Amarok:
Tools -> Script Manager: General -> pacx -> Run

log
@update pacpl to 4.0.5, also:

- patch to fix the annoying warnings on systems without LANG or
PWD set in the environment

- roll subpackages into the main package; no point having an entire
package that just installs some scripts/data files (which are harmless
if the corresponding package is not installed) and adds run deps.
