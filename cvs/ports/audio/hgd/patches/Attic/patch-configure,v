@Update to hgd-0.5.3. A bugfix release.

@$OpenBSD: patch-configure,v 1.3 2011/12/04 12:57:09 edd Exp $

MPlayer is not actually a build dependency, so don't bail if not installed at build time.

Bug raised upstream.

1.1
log
@Prevent configure failing if mplayer is not present at build time. MPlayer is a RUN_DEPEND and is
not really needed for the build. In the next release, we will make the check at runtime.
