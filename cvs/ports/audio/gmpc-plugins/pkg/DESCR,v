@Enable wikipedia plugin, which fetches artist info from wikipedia.
As it drags webkit as a dependency, subpackage it, and only build it on
archs where webkit builds.
Add a patch from upstream git repo to fix a bug.
Explicitely depend on taglib 1.5 for tagedit plugin while here.
looks good to jasper@@

log
@Import gmpc-plugins 0.18.0. Finally, upstream decided to bundle several
plugins altogether, this will clean a bit audio/...
This package provides various cover/metadata/lyrics fetcher plugins,
jamendo and magnatune plugins, osd & shout plugins, and a nice tag editor
plugin. No upgrade path is possible, you'll have to manually remove old
versions of those plugins before installing this package.
