@import ports/audio/squeezelite, ok jca@@

Squeezelite is a small squeezebox emulator using PortAudio. It is
headless, and must be controlled via Logitech Media Server. It supports
gapless playback, client synchronization (allowing groups of clients for
simultaneous playback), and direct streaming for those LMS plugins which
require it. It has a built-in decoder for PCM (wav/aiff); other formats
(flac, mp3, ogg, aac, wma, alac) are available via libraries. It has
resampling support via libsoxr.
