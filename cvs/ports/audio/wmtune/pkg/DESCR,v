@remove the zoltrix flavour from audio/wmtune, it currently needs to run as
root (I think also with securelevel=-1), and the ioctl it uses is going away.

WMTune is a WindowMaker dock.app that controls Zoltrix FM radio tuner cards
and any other cards supported under OpenBSD.

log
@o Add support for OpenBSD native /dev/radio (note that wmtune uses interface
  which was commited into -current on December 5th)
o Remove the aztech and radiotrack flavors since both are supported by
  OpenBSD drivers
o Simplify config file (now there's no need to specify number of presets)
o Small fixes like strcpy -> strlcpy etc
