@Xmcd is a program that allows the use of the CD-ROM drive as a
full-featured stereo compact-disc player for the X Window System.

Most of the features found on real CD players are available in xmcd,
such as shuffle and repeat, track programming functions, a numeric
keypad, and track warp slider for direct track access.  Additional
functions include sample play, A to B segment play, volume control,
balance control, etc.  Several automation options are also available on
CD load, eject, play completion, and program exit.  A Channel Routing
feature allows you to select from several stereo or mono routing
options.  The volume control slider taper characteristics can also be
altered.

@Entirely new port for xmcd 2.6, largely derived from FreeBSD and Debian.
Once upon a time reviewed by espie@@.
Reported to be unstable with LessTif, fine with OpenMotif.
