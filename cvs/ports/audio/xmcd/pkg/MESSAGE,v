@Before using xmcd/cda for the first time, you must set up the software
by running the following program:

      ${PREFIX}/sbin/xmcdconfig

Xmcd/cda will not work until that is done.

You may also want to set up cron(8) to run the
${PREFIX}/share/xmcd/scripts/genidx script periodically (e.g., nightly)
to re-generate the local discography category index pages.

@Use ${PACKAGE} instead of $PACKAGE in the MESSAGE file, so the output at
install time makes sense.
