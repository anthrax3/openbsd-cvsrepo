@Xmcd is a program that allows the use of the CD-ROM  drive
as  a  full-featured  stereo compact-disc player for the X
window system. 

Most  of  the  features  found  on  real  CD  players  are
available  in  xmcd,  such  as  shuffle  and repeat, track
programming functions, a numeric  keypad  and  track  warp
slider  for  direct  track  access.   Additional functions
include sample play, A to B segment play, volume  control,
balance control, etc.  Several automation options are also
available on CD load, eject, play completion  and  program
exit.   A Channel Routing feature allow you to select from
several  stereo  or  mono  routing  options.   The  volume
control  slider taper characteristics can also be altered.
