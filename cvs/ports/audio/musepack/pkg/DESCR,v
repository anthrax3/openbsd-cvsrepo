@Musepack is an audio compression format with a strong emphasis on high
quality. It's not lossless, but it is designed for transparency, so that
you won't be able to hear differences between the original wave file and
the much smaller MPC file.

It is based on the MPEG-1 Layer-2 / MP2 algorithms, but has rapidly
developed and vastly improved and is now at an advanced stage in which
it contains heavily optimized and patentless code.
