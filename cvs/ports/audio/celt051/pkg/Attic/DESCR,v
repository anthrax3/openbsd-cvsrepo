@x11/spice-gtk is now using opus so nothing else depends on unmaintained
celt051 -- drop it.

@The CELT codec is an experimental audio codec for use in low-delay
speech and audio communication. It's meant to close the gap between
Vorbis and Speex for applications where both high quality audio and
low delay are desired.

This package contains the celt051 API.

Note that the CELT codec has been merged into the IETF Opus codec
(http://opus-codec.org/) and is now considered obsolete.

the fact that it has now been deprecated in favor of the IETF Opus
codec.
