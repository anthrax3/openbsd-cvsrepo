# Output is three lists:
#
#  Missing files:	files that should be in the directory (if the
#			intent is to obtain all files that can be
#			re-distributed) but are not.
#
#  Bad files:		files that must NOT be in a distribution
#			directory.  These are listed in the form
#			of a shell `mv -f xxx ../licensed' command so
#			they can be fed to the shell (after manual
#			verification) to move them into a directory
#			that will not be copied to any CD-ROM.
#
#  Unknown files:	files that are noted in the LICENSE file but
#			do not have a distribution flag of either Y or N.

#  Extra files:		Files that are in the given directory that are
#			not mentioned in the ports LICENSE file.

@first pass at updating the LICENCE file.  The file is
up-to-date wrt the distfiles actually used by the existing ports, but
most of the new entries have not been classified by their license, yet.
