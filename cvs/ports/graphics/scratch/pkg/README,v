If upgrading from Scratch 1.3:

  * The "iniscratch" program is not needed or provided with Scratch 1.4.

  * Running "scratch" is sufficient; no preparation is necessary.

  * Some Scratch files that reside in ~/Scratch are
    not needed by Scratch 1.4 and may be removed.

    $ cd ~/Scratch && rm -rf Scratch.image Help Media Projects locale
