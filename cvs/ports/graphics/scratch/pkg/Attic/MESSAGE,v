@import graphics/scratch:

A new programming language that makes it easy to create your own
interactive stories, animations, games, music, and art - and share your
creations on the web. Designed to help young people (ages 8 and up)
develop 21st century learning skills. As they create Scratch projects,
young people learn important mathematical and computational ideas, while
also gaining a deeper understanding of the process of design.

from maintainer Stuart Cassoff, with tweaks by me and input from
ajacoutot@@.
