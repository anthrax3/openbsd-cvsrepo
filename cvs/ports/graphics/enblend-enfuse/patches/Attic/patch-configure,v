@update enblend-enfuse to 4.0, with a patch to allow documentation to
built with in-tree texinfo (it wanted the textdegree macro which wasn't
added until texinfo-4.11).

@import graphics/enblend-enfuse:

Enblend combines images that partially overlap into a single large
image with no seams (panorama generation). This is a command-line
tool which performs the actual composition; another tool is required
to line up the images ready for input (e.g. Hugin).

Enfuse combines images that overlap into a single image with good
focus and exposure (exposure stacking for high dynamic range, focus
stacking for extended depth-of-field).

will be hooked to the build after tests on additional arch.
big thanks to Emmanuel Viaud for rewriting some C++ to build with GCC 3.
