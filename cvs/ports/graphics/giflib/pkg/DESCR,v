@giflib is a library for rendering and generating GIF image files. This
is the GIF service code in C used for over two decades by graphics
applications, Web browsers, game consoles, ATMs, and pretty much
anything else that throws pixels on a display.

This package has been released under an X Consortium-life freeware
license. Use and copy as you see fit. If you make useful changes, add
new tools, or find and fix bugs, please send your mods to the
maintainers for general distribution.
The util directory includes programs to clip, rotate, scale, and
position GIF images. It includes an X11 viewer, code to dump GIFs to
an Epson-compatible printer in graphics mode, and many conversion
utilities. These are no replacement for an interactive graphics
editor, but they can be very useful for scripted image generation or
transformation.
