@OpenEXR is a high dynamic-range (HDR) image file format developed
by Industrial Light & Magic for use in computer imaging applications.


OpenEXR is used by ILM on all motion pictures currently in production.
The first movies to employ OpenEXR were Harry Potter and the Sorcerers
Stone, Men in Black II, Gangs of New York, and Signs. Since then,
OpenEXR has become ILM's main image file format.


OpenEXR's features include:

* Higher dynamic range and color precision than existing 8- and 10-bit
image file formats.
* Support for 16-bit floating-point, 32-bit floating-point, and 32-bit
integer pixels. The 16-bit floating-point format, called "half",
is compatible with the half data type in NVIDIA's Cg graphics
language and is supported natively on their new GeForce FX and
Quadro FX 3D graphics solutions.
* Multiple lossless image compression algorithms. Some of the included
codecs can achieve 2:1 lossless compression ratios on images with
film grain.
* Extensibility. New compression codecs and image types can easily
be added by extending the C++ classes included in the OpenEXR
software distribution. New image attributes (strings, vectors,
integers, etc.) can be added to OpenEXR image headers without
affecting backward compatibility with existing OpenEXR applications.

ILM has released OpenEXR as free software. The OpenEXR software distribution includes: 

* IlmImf, a library that reads and writes OpenEXR images. 
* Half, a C++ class for manipulating half values as if they were a
built-in C++ data type.
Imath, a math library with support for matrices, 2d- and
* 3d-transformations, solvers for linear/quadratic/cubic equations,
and more.

Applications and documentations are available as separate OpenBSD packages:
OpenEXR-tools and OpenEXR-doc.

@split off documentation and tools, so that OpenEXR no longer depends on
fltk.

XXX Need to bump directly to p1 because of conflict issue. (p* stuff is
transparent unless explicit, so the subpackage can conflict with
OpenEXR-<=1.2.2p0)
