@Import graphics/krita 3.1.4

Krita is a raster graphics editor based on Qt 5 and the KDE Frameworks 5. Krita
is designed to be a digital painting application. It has been influenced to
some extent by software like Corel Painter and SAI. Krita packs with some key
features different from most of its kind, including the ability to work with
both bitmap and vector illustration.
