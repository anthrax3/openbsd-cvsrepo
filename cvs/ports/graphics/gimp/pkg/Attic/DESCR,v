@The GNU Image Manipulation Program (GIMP) is a powerful tool for the
preparation and manipulation of digital images.  The GIMP provides the user
with a wide variety of image manipulation, painting, processing, and
rendering tools.  The key to the GIMP's power lies in its flexible
core and easily extensible design.  The GIMP's open design and
extensible architecture make for a very powerful end product which can
continue to be extended to meet the needs of the photo compositor,
image retoucher, web graphics designer, or digital illustrator for a
very long time.

The GIMP's extensible plug-in architecture allows for image
manipulation procedures and other functionality to be easily added
without requiring any change to the application core.  A plug-in can
provide functionality as simple as rotating an image, or as
complicated as rendering iterated function system fractals.  There are
over 140+ plug-ins available in version 1.1, and more are sure to
follow.

The plug-in architecture also allows the GIMP to support a wide
variety of file formats.  File operations are implemented by special
file plug-ins, allowing additional file formats to be added
without modification to the core.  File formats supported in version
1.1 include the popular GIF and JPEG standards, as well as PNG, TIFF,
XPM, SGI, PCX, and Windows BMP.
