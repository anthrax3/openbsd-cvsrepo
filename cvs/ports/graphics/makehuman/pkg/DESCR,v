@MakeHuman is an open-source, open graphics library, stand-alone,
multi-platform, software program, which is completely written in C++
language.  Its purpose is to provide a versatile, professional and
extremely specialized application for parametrical modeling of
three-dimensional humanoid characters.

MakeHuman's purpose is to model and pose a 3D humanoid, complete with
hair, accessories and high quality UV maps.  It will only make an
acceptably photo realistic, poseable, humanoid character suitable for
use in a variety of applications and for a variety of purposes ?
marketing campaigns, advertisements, animations, graphic art, and 3D
games, just to name a few.

Photorealistic images of characters, with a transparent background, will
be able to be produced via RenderMan compliant rendering applications;
and then, inserted during post production into complex scenarios made
with 3D graphics manipulation, animation, or multimedia editing
programs.
