@import orthanc-1.3.0

Orthanc aims at providing a simple, yet powerful standalone DICOM
server. It is designed to improve the DICOM flows in hospitals and to
support research about the automated analysis of medical images. Orthanc
lets its users focus on the content of the DICOM files, hiding the
complexity of the DICOM format and of the DICOM protocol.

might need some polishing which can happen in-tree
feedback and ok zhuk@@
