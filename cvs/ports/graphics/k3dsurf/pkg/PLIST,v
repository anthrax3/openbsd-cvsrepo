@Convert to qmake.port.mk, shaving 7 lines from Makefile and not needed
anymore patch. The qmake.port.mk takes care of CXXFLAGS already.

As a bonus, add @@bin marker in PLIST, thus REVISION bump.

@Import k3dsurf-0.6.1

K3DSurf can be used by everyone interested in 3D Mathematical drawing
functions and doesn't require any special competence of users.  Most of
the work was done with the intention to make K3DSurf as simple as
possible without affecting its efficiency: K3DSurf program is developed
for use by beginner users with low level degree in mathematical science
by simply testing examples given with it and by rendering them with
Povray.  Pov scripts (and other file formats) generated by K3DSurf can
also be integrated in complicated scenes.
