1.1.1.1
log
@The GdkPixbuf library is a replacement for Imlib. GdkPixbuf provides
the following: a basic data structure to provide reference-counted images,
functions to load images synchronously from disk or progressively from
arbitrary data buffers, and convenience functions to transform pixbufs
and render them to drawables.
