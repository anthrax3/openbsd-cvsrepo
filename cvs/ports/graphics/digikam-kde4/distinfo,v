@Update KDE4 version of Digikam to 4.11.0.

This time we have three libraries previously shipped as a part
of Digikam SC separated, this commit links them to build altogether.

Thanks to sthen@@ and czarkoff@@ for reviewing considerable part of work.

@digiKam is an advanced digital photo management application for
KDE, which makes importing and organizing digital photos a "snap".
The photos are organized in albums which can be sorted chronologically,
by folder layout or by custom collections.

digiKam supports tagging, KIPI plugins, import from digital cameras.
It also has Light Table feature.

This commit is dedicated to the espie@@, who prodded me with this port for
more than a year.
