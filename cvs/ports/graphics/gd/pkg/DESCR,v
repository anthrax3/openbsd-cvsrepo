@GD is an open source code library for the dynamic creation of images by
programmers.

GD is written in C, and "wrappers" are available for Perl, PHP and other
languages. GD creates PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP, XPM, BMP images, among other
formats. GD is commonly used to generate charts, graphics, thumbnails,
and most anything else, on the fly. While not restricted to use on the
web, the most common applications of GD involve website development.

gd is a graphics library. It allows your code to quickly draw images
complete with lines, arcs, text, multiple colors, cut and paste from
other images, and flood fills, and write out the result as a .PNG file.
This is particularly useful in World Wide Web applications, where .PNG
is one of the formats accepted for inline images by most browsers.

gd is not a paint program. If you are looking for a paint program, you
are looking in the wrong place. If you are not a programmer, you are
looking in the wrong place.

gd does not provide for every possible desirable graphics operation. It
is not necessary or desirable for gd to become a kitchen-sink graphics
package, but version 1.6.2 incorporates most of the commonly requested
features for an 8-bit 2D package. Support for scalable fonts, and
truecolor images, JPEG and truecolor PNG is planned for version 2.0.

@upgrade to gd 1.6.2;

- this version now generates the .PNG graphics file format and NOT .GIF,
this is due to the patent Unisys has on LZW compression.
