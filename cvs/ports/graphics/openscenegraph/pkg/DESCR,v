@The OpenSceneGraph is an open source high performance 3D graphics
toolkit, used by application developers in fields such as visual
simulation, games, virtual reality, scientific visualization and
modelling. Written entirely in Standard C++ and OpenGL it runs on all
Windows platforms, OSX, GNU/Linux, IRIX, Solaris, HP-Ux, AIX and FreeBSD
operating systems. The OpenSceneGraph is now well established as the
world leading scene graph technology, used widely in the vis-sim, space,
scientific, oil-gas, games and virtual reality industries.
