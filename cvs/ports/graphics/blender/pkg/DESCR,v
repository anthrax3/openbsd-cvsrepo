@Enable the new 'cycles' rendering engine.  There may still be some rough edges,
but overall it is working well.  Initially requested and tested by peters at
schwertfisch dot de (thanks).

Also, remove mention of ffmpeg flavour from DESCR.

@Blender is an integrated suite of tools enabling the creation of a
broad range of 3D content. It offers full functionality for modelling,
rendering, animation, post-production, creation and playback of
interactive 3D content with the benefit of cross-platform operability.
Aimed at media professionals and artists, Blender can be used to create
3D visualizations, stills as well as broadcast quality video.

Developed as the in-house software of a high quality animation
studio, Blender has proven to be an extremely fast and versatile
design instrument. The software has a personal touch, offering a
unique approach to the world of Three Dimensions. Use Blender to
create TV commercials, to make technical visualizations, business
graphics, to do some morphing, or design user interfaces. You can
easy build and manage complex environments. The renderer is versatile
and extremely fast.  All basic animation principles (curves & keys)
are well implemented.
