@Graphite is a package that can be used to create "smart fonts" capable
of displaying writing systems with various complex behaviors. A smart
font contains not only letter shapes but also additional instructions
indicating how to combine and position the letters in complex ways.

Graphite was developed to provide the flexibility needed for minority
languages which often need to be written according to slightly different
rules than well-known languages that use the same script.
