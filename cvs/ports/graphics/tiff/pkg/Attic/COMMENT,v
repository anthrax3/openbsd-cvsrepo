@1) remove tiff from graphics makefile as there is nothing to make
2) change tiff/Makefile to spit out message saying to use tiff34
   remove all tiff files, patches, and pkg data; they're no longer needed
3) install tiff34 as libtiff, tiff.h, and tiffio.h; add symbolic links
   so the old names of libtiff34, tiff34.h, and tiffio34.h still work.
4) Change ImageMagick to use -ltiff, not -ltiff34; remove the patch
   files and directory as they are no longer needed.
5) Change gimp to use -ltiff, not -ltiff34; remove the patch files and
   directory as they are no longer needed.

NOTE: with these changes ImageMagick and gimp require the updated tiff34
      port.
