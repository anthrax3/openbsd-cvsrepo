log
@Make sure we pull in errno.h for all files in sane-backends that use
errno. This is a requirement on OpenBSD now that errno is stored in the
TIB; most uses have already been taken care of, but this slipped through
the cracks as it only provides a dlopen()'d module rather than object
code which is linked during build.  ok guenther@@ ajacoutot@@

Note to readers, if you see "undefined symbol 'errno'" messages when you
run or use programs on OpenBSD following this change (libc 87.0 etc.),
please report them, even if the program appears to otherwise run normally.

@$OpenBSD$

errno.h header is required now that errno is a per-thread variable.
"undefined symbol 'errno'" at runtime with dlopen()'d modules.
