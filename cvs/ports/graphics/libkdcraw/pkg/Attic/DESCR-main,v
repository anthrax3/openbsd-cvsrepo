@libkdcraw is a C++ interface around the dcraw binary program used to
decode "raw" picture files.  The library documentation is available on
header files.

This library is used by kipi-plugins, digiKam and others KIPI host
programs.

log
@Final KDE 3 part of libkdcraw and libkipi deconflicting.

Please note that we still cannot install kdelibs-3.x and 4.x, so you cannot
actually install libkdcraw and libkipi from KDE 3 and 4 side-by-side. Yet.
