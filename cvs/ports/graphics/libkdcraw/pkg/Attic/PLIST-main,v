@Final KDE 3 part of libkdcraw and libkipi deconflicting.

Please note that we still cannot install kdelibs-3.x and 4.x, so you cannot
actually install libkdcraw and libkipi from KDE 3 and 4 side-by-side. Yet.

Tested in a bulk by landry@@

1.2
log
@Do a massive change on the placement of some KDE3 apps data:

  * share/apps => share/apps.kde3
  * share/doc/HTML => share/doc/HTML.kde3

This is a part of KDE3/4 deconflicting work.

Build tested in a bulk by landry@@, also sat over a week on ports@@.
Run-time tested with some KDE3 apps, including KMail, taxipilot, yakuake...

@Split icons off libkdcraw package, to deconflict it with x11/kde4/libkdcraw.
Also, allow it to build with our make(1).
