@This package contains shareable icons for libkdcraw, used
to allow KDE 3 and 4 to be installed simultaneously.

log
@Final KDE 3 part of libkdcraw and libkipi deconflicting.

Please note that we still cannot install kdelibs-3.x and 4.x, so you cannot
actually install libkdcraw and libkipi from KDE 3 and 4 side-by-side. Yet.
