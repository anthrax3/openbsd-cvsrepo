 Hand editing is achieved by copying scripts/pnglibconf.h.prebuilt and changing
 the lines defining the supported features, paying very close attention to the

@Update to png 1.5.2.  Lots of improvements, but also significant
API incompatibility:

"The libpng 1.5.x series finally hides the contents of the venerable
and hoary png_struct and png_info data structures inside private
(i.e., non-installed) header files. Instead of direct struct-access,
applications should be using the various png_get_xxx() and png_set_xxx()
accessor functions, which have existed for almost as long as libpng
itself."
