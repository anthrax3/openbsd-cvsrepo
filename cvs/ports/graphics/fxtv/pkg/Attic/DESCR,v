@Remove port of 13 year old fxtv release.

@FXTV provides TV-in-a-window and image/audio/video capture capabilities
for Brooktree-based tuner/capture cards through the Brooktree video
capture driver, bktr(4). It can take advantage of direct video and DGA.
FXTV can perform video and audio capture, and run a script to assemble
captured data into an audio/video MPEG stream.

   Fxtv is an X11-based OpenBSD app that provides TV-in-a-window and
   image/audio/video capture capabilities for Bt848/878-based tuner/capture
   cards.

   To use this app, you need OpenBSD 2.4 or above as well as a capture card
   based on the Brooktree 848/878 chip.
   Examples include the Hauppauge Wincast/TV, the STB TV PCI,
   and the Intel Smart Video Recorder III.

   The Fxtv home page is http://www.freebsd.org/~rhh/fxtv

   Refer to the README for details on usage
