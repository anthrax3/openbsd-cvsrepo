maim (Make Image) is a utility that takes screenshots of your desktop using
imlib2. It's meant to overcome shortcomings of scrot and performs better
in several ways.

Features:
* Allows you to take a screenshot of your desktop and save it in any format.
* Allows you to take a screenshot of a predetermined region or window of
  your desktop.
* If slop is installed, it can be used for selecting a region to screenshot.
* Allows you to blend the system cursor into screenshots.
* Allows you to mask off-screen pixels to be black and transparent in
  screenshots. (Great for people who use an uneven multi-monitor setup!)
