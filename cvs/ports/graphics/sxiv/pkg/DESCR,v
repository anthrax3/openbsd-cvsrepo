@update 1.3.1 -> 1.3.2

From Michael Reed. ok jung@@

@sxiv is an alternative to feh and qiv. Its only dependencies besides
xlib are imlib2, libexif and giflib. The primary goal for writing sxiv
is to create an image viewer, which only has the most basic features
required for fast image viewing (the ones I want). It has vi key
bindings and works nicely with tiling window managers. Its code base
should be kept small and clean to make it easy for you to dig into it
and customize it for your needs.
