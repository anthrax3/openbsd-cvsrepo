@update Hugin to 2010.4.0, tested by Kirill Bychkov, thanks!
This version introduces cpfind, a patent-free control point
generator (i.e.  tool to automatically find matching points
between two images for stitching together).
@
text
@You may optionally install autopano-sift-C to automatically detect
similar image features and generate control points. As autopano-sift-C
uses the SIFT algorithm, which is patented in the USA, this is not
automatically installed as a dependency.

Either "pkg_add autopano-sift-c" or select your control points manually.

@- SEPARATE_BUILD works for this (and should for most CMake projects),
use it, it's preferable.

- PERMIT_*_CDROM=Yes, the deghosting code has been replaced since then

- don't automatically RUN_DEPENDS on autopano-sift-c; add an install
message instead. Although it's a timesaver, hugin can work well without
this, and it's still subject to a USA patent, so don't force it.

bump PKGNAME.
