@update Hugin to 2010.4.0, tested by Kirill Bychkov, thanks!
This version introduces cpfind, a patent-free control point
generator (i.e.  tool to automatically find matching points
between two images for stitching together).
@
text
@Hugin is a panoramic imaging toolchain and easy-to-use GUI frontend,
based on the Panorama Tools library. It allows you to assemble a mosaic
of photographs into a complete immersive panorama, stitch any series
of overlapping pictures, correct for various lens characteristics,
work with high dynamic range images, automatically identify control
points for image matching, and much more.

Goal: an easy to use cross-platform panoramic imaging toolchain
based on the Panorama Tools library.

With hugin you can assemble a mosaic of photographs into a
complete immersive panorama, stitch any series of overlapping
pictures and much more.

This package contains the following programs:

 - hugin, The main program, a GUI for the panorama tools suite
   and some programs included here.

 - nona, a simple replacement for PTStitcher (doesn't support most
   features of PTStitcher, but is faster, opensource and
   will be extended in the future).
 
 - nona_gui, nona with a graphical progress bar.

 - autooptimiser, optimise a panorama pairwise, starting from an
   anchor image. cmd line version of the pairwise mode in hugin.

@import graphics/hugin: this port was made possible by Emmanuel Viaud's
work on enblend-enfuse, big thanks!
