@mtPaint is a simple GTK+1/2 painting program designed for creating icons and
pixel based artwork. It can edit indexed palette or 24 bit RGB images and offers
basic painting and palette manipulation tools. It also has several other more
powerful features such as channels, layers and animation. Due to its simplicity
and lack of dependencies it runs well on GNU/Linux, Windows and older PC
hardware.
