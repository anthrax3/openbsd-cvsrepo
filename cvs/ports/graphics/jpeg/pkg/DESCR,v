@switch over to libjpeg-turbo (1.4.2)

ok aja@@ sthen@@
@
text
@libjpeg-turbo is a high-speed version of libjpeg for x86 and x86-64 processors
which uses SIMD instructions (MMX, SSE2, etc.) to accelerate baseline JPEG
compression and decompression.
libjpeg-turbo is generally 2-4x as fast as the unmodified version
of libjpeg, all else being equal.

libjpeg-turbo was originally based on libjpeg/SIMD by Miyasaka Masaru,
but the TigerVNC and VirtualGL projects made numerous enhancements to the codec,
including improved support for Mac OS X, 64-bit support,
support for 32-bit and big endian pixel formats (RGBA, ABGR, etc.),
accelerated Huffman encoding/decoding, and various bug fixes.
The goal was to produce a fully open source codec that could replace
the partially closed source TurboJPEG/IPP codec used by VirtualGL and TurboVNC.
libjpeg-turbo generally achieves 80-120% of the performance of TurboJPEG/IPP.
It is faster in some areas but slower in others.

This package contains software to implement JPEG image encoding, decoding,
and transcoding.  JPEG (pronounced "jay-peg") is a standardized compression
method for full-color and gray-scale images.

a15 9
This software implements JPEG baseline, extended-sequential, and progressive
compression processes.

A set of library routines for reading and writing JPEG image files is provided,
plus two sample applications "cjpeg" and "djpeg", which use the library to
perform conversion between JPEG and some other popular image file formats.
Also included is "jpegtran", a utility for lossless transcoding between
different JPEG processes, and "rdjpgcom" and "wrjpgcom", two simple
applications for inserting and extracting textual comments in JFIF files.
