@gPhoto is an universal, free GTK+ application that will allow
downloading, saving, and manipulation of images from several 
different digital camera models, or from the local harddrive.

gPhoto has a basic command line interface, which is handy, 
if you want to set up a web camera, and use gphoto in a 
script, e.g. with Perl/PHP.  

gPhoto sports a new HTML engine, that let's you create your
gallery "themes" (HTML with special tags), and publish images 
to the web.  A directory browse mode has also been implemented.

gPhoto supports a wide array of digital camera models.
