@Remove KDE3 applications that have well-working KDE4+ counterparts.

@Kipi (KDE Image Plugin Interface) is a common plugin structure
for digiKam, KimDaBa, Showimg and Gwenview, aiming at sharing image
plugins among graphic applications.

log
@Final KDE 3 part of libkdcraw and libkipi deconflicting.

Please note that we still cannot install kdelibs-3.x and 4.x, so you cannot
actually install libkdcraw and libkipi from KDE 3 and 4 side-by-side. Yet.

1.1
log
@Split libkipi into -main and -icons the same way it was done
for libkdcraw.

While there:
  * added a patch to build with our make(1),
  * added SEPARATE_BUILD=Yes,
  * removed extra wording from DESCR-main,
  * tweaked word casing in COMMENT-main,
  * updated WANTLIB.
