1.2

@Update to 2.4.6.1. Sat in my tree until sthen@@ helped me to realize that.
Key notes:

  * OpenCV now has separate "opencv_nonfree" module, which contains all of
    the patented algorithms. It was decided on ports@@ to not create "nonfree"
    FLAVOR but just set PERMIT_PACKAGE_CDROM=No, while allowing FTP
    distribution.

  * OpenCV now have its own Java bindings. You could avoid building them by
    using the "no_java" PSEUDO_FLAVOR.

  * Documentation placement was cleaned up, too.

Input from sthen@@ and naddy@@. Tested on i386 and amd64 with Digikam from WIP.

Okay sthen@@ and Rafael Sadowski (MAINTAINER)
