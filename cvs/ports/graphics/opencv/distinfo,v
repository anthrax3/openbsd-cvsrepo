@Update OpenCV to 2.4.12.3.

This fixes library naming in pkg-config files, as it was reported on ports@@.
Also, it'd be last update before OpenCV 3.0, which is WIP (in openbsd-wip).

From maintainer Rafael Sadowski, thanks!

log
@Update OpenCV to 2.4.10, mostly from Rafael Sadowski (MAINTAINER).

This switches the whole package to PIC (from PIE) due to problems with
inline assembly and build system specifics. Since OpenCV is used mostly
as a library, this shouldn't be a big problem.

log
@Update to 2.4.6.1. Sat in my tree until sthen@@ helped me to realize that.
Key notes:

  * OpenCV now has separate "opencv_nonfree" module, which contains all of
    the patented algorithms. It was decided on ports@@ to not create "nonfree"
    FLAVOR but just set PERMIT_PACKAGE_CDROM=No, while allowing FTP
    distribution.

  * OpenCV now have its own Java bindings. You could avoid building them by
    using the "no_java" PSEUDO_FLAVOR.

  * Documentation placement was cleaned up, too.

Input from sthen@@ and naddy@@. Tested on i386 and amd64 with Digikam from WIP.

Okay sthen@@ and Rafael Sadowski (MAINTAINER)
