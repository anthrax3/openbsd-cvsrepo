1.2
log
@Update FFmpeg to 20110408 snapshot.

- Enable WebM encoding.
- Stop stripping the shared libraries which explains why I was
   seeing no symbol table with the shared libraries.
- Build all of FFmpeg with -fomit-frame-pointer on i386 instead of
   hacking the various Makefile's and having to add more files as
   further updates are made. Use default CFLAGS (-O2) on i386 now too
   instead of overriding with -O.
- Remove the UINT64_C hack.
- Update HOMEPAGE to use the ffmpeg.org domain.
- Various other cleaning up and fixes for the port.

From Brad, ok dcoppa@@
