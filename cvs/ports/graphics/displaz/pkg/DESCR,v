@displaz is a cross platform viewer for displaying lidar point clouds and
derived artifacts such as fitted meshes. The interface was originally developed
for viewing large airborne laser scans, but also works quite well for point
clouds acquired using terrestrial lidar and other sources such as bathymetric
sonar.

The goal is to provide a flexible and programmable technical tool for exploring
large lidar point data sets and derived geometry.

@Import displaz 0.3.3pre0.

displaz is a cross platform viewer for displaying lidar point clouds and
derived artifacts such as fitted meshes. The interface was originally developed
for viewing large airborne laser scans, but also works quite well for point
clouds acquired using terrestrial lidar and other sources such as bathymetric
sonar, cf http://c42f.github.io/displaz/.

A single patch is being pushed upstream.
