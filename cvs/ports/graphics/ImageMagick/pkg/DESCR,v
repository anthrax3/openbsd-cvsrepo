@update to ImageMagick-6.9.2-7, drop wmf delegate, move back to non-modular
build.

Since 6.9.0 the wmf delegate depends on MagickWand; with a non-modular
build the delegate is in MagickCore, meaning that if enabled, programs
can no longer link against just Core. In the last version of this port we
changed to the modular build to avoid the wmf issue, however as discovered
by Manolis Tzanidakis the modular build doesn't play nicely with programs
trying to use this from chroot e.g. common uses of pecl-imagick.

http://www.imagemagick.org/discourse-server/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=28634

At least some wmf functionality still seems to work even without the
delegate, but if you need this and run into problems, you could try
GraphicsMagick instead (prefix tools with 'gm' e.g. 'gm convert' instead
of just 'convert').

@ImageMagick is a software suite (library and primarily command-line
tools) to create, edit, compose, or convert bitmap images. It can read
and write images in a variety of formats including PNG, JPEG, JPEG-2000,
GIF, TIFF, DPX, EXR, WebP, Postscript, PDF, and SVG. Use ImageMagick
to resize, flip, mirror, rotate, distort, shear and transform images,
adjust image colors, apply various special effects, or draw text, lines,
polygons, ellipses and Bezier curves.

ImageMagick is an X11 package for display and interactive manipulation
of images.  The package includes tools for image conversion, annotation,
compositing, animation, and creating montages.  ImageMagick can read and
write many of the more popular image formats (e.g. JPEG, TIFF, PNM, XPM,
Photo CD, etc.).

With ImageMagick you can:

     o load an image from a file
     o display the next image
     o display the former image
     o display a sequence of images as a slide show
     o write the image to a file
     o print the image to a Postscript printer
     o delete the image file
     o create a Visual Image Directory
     o select the image to display by its thumbnail rather than name
     o undo last image transformation
     o copy a region of the image
     o paste a region to the image
     o restore the image to its original size
     o refresh the image
     o half the image size
     o double the image size
     o resize the image
     o crop the image
     o cut the image
     o flop image in the horizontal direction
     o flip image in the vertical direction
     o rotate the image 90 degrees clockwise
     o rotate the image 90 degrees counter-clockwise
     o rotate the image
     o shear the image
     o trim the image edges
     o invert the colors of the image
     o vary the color brightness
     o vary the color saturation
     o vary the image hue
     o gamma correct the image
     o sharpen the image contrast
     o dull the image contrast
     o perform histogram equalization on the image
     o perform histogram normalization on the image
     o negate the image colors
     o toggle the colormap type: : Shared or Private
     o reduce the speckles within an image
     o eliminate peak noise from an image
     o detect edges within the image
     o emboss an image
     o oil paint an image
     o convert the image to grayscale
     o set the maximum number of unique colors in the image
     o segment the image by color
     o apply image processing techniques to a region of interest
     o annotate the image with text
     o draw on the image
     o edit an image pixel color
     o edit the image matte information
     o composite an image with another
     o add a border to the image
     o surround image with an ornamental border
     o add an image comment
     o display image centered on a backdrop
     o display image to background of a window
     o display information about the image
     o display information about this program
     o discard all images and exit program
     o change the level of magnification
     o display images specified by a World Wide Web (WWW) uniform resource
       locator (URL)
