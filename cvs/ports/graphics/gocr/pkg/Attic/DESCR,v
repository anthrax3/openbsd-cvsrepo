@GOCR is an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) program.
It reads images in many formats and output a text file. Possible image
formats are pnm, pbm, pgm, ppm, some pcx and tga image files. Other
formats like pnm.gz, pnm.bz2, png, jpg, tiff, gif, bmp will be
automatically converted using the netpbm-progs, gzip and bzip2
via unix pipe.
Gocr is also able to recognize and translate barcodes.
You do not have to train the program or store large font bases.
Simply call gocr from the command line and get your results.
