@Update to openjpeg-1.5.2

This doesn't solve all the problems currently affecting openjpeg, but
makes it easier to pick up fixes.  Cheating a bit, as the lib lost two
symbols, but those should never have been included in the library
anyway.

Feedback, tests and ok sthen@@ (maintainer)

@Update to OpenJPEG 1.5.1, note that there are still some known security
bugs (as pointed out by jca), but this is a better base from which to update.
Rolls in previous security fixes we had as patches.
Merge PFRAG.shared while there.
