@image manipulation plugins accessible through libkipi:

- rawconverter
- slideshow
- mpegencoder: needs mjpegtools at runtime
- imagesgallery
- printwizard
- jpeglossless
- cdarchiving: would need k3b as a run time dependency
- acquireimages: from scanner or screen snapshot
- calendar
- sendimages: through email
- batchprocessimages: needs imagemagic at runtime
- timeadjust
- wallpaper: needs kdebase at runtime
- findimages: find duplicate images
- galleryexport
- kameraklient
- metadata editor
- gps data

The kcal calendar is in kipi-kcal-plugin because of its extra dependencies.
