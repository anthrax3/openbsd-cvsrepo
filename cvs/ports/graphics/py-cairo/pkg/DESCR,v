@Update to py-cairo-1.12.0.
Use the new fork from pygobject hosted on GitHub which is actually
maintained, does not use the horrible waf build system and supports both
python2 and 3.

@Pycairo is a Python module providing bindings for the cairo graphics library.

The Pycairo bindings are designed to match the cairo C API as closely as
possible, and to deviate only in cases which are clearly better implemented in a
more 'Pythonic' way.

Features of the Pycairo bindings:

* Provides an object oriented interface to cairo.
* Queries the error status of objects and translates them to exceptions.
* Provides a C API that can be used by other Python extensions.
@


1.2
log
@* switch to GNU configure
* change dependencies in preparation for py-gtk2 2.8
