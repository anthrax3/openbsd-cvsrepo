@remove old libtiff

@This software provides support for the Tag Image File Format (TIFF), a
widely used format for storing image data.

Included in this software distribution is a library, libtiff, for
reading and writing TIFF, a small collection of tools for doing simple
manipulations of TIFF images on UNIX systems, and documentation on the
library and tools. A small assortment of TIFF-related software for
UNIX that has been contributed by others is also included.

The library is capable of dealing with images that are written to
follow the 5.0 or 6.0 TIFF spec.  There is also considerable support
for some of the more esoteric portions of the 6.0 TIFF spec.

SGI has also added html-documentation in addition to man-pages.

@1) remove tiff from graphics makefile as there is nothing to make
2) change tiff/Makefile to spit out message saying to use tiff34
   remove all tiff files, patches, and pkg data; they're no longer needed
3) install tiff34 as libtiff, tiff.h, and tiffio.h; add symbolic links
   so the old names of libtiff34, tiff34.h, and tiffio34.h still work.
4) Change ImageMagick to use -ltiff, not -ltiff34; remove the patch
   files and directory as they are no longer needed.
5) Change gimp to use -ltiff, not -ltiff34; remove the patch files and
   directory as they are no longer needed.

NOTE: with these changes ImageMagick and gimp require the updated tiff34
      port.

NOTE: Since it is suspected that there's incompatibility between
libtiff 3.4 and previous releases, we install this kit as follows.
