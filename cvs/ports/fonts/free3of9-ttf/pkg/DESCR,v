@3 of 9, sometimes called "code 39", is a widely used barcode standard that
includes capital letters, numbers, and several symbols. This package includes
two fonts making this available to applications:

"Free 3 of 9" includes the basic 3 of 9 standard characters: numbers,
upper-case letters and the following symbols:  $ % + - . /

"Free 3 of 9 Extended" implements most of the extended standard,
including all of the ASCII characters.

They are suitable for scanning even at fairly small point sizes.
