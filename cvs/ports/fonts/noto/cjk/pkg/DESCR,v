@Noto Sans CJK is a sans serif typeface designed as an intermediate style
between the modern and traditional. It is intended to be a multi-purpose
digital font for user interface designs, digital content, reading on
laptops, mobile devices, and electronic books. Noto Sans CJK comprehensively
covers Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, Japanese, and Korean in a
unified font family. It supports regional variants of ideographic characters
for each of the four languages. In addition, it supports Japanese kana,
vertical forms, and variant characters (itaiji); it supports Korean hangeul,
both contemporary and archaic.

@Noto is a font family designed to cover the entire range of the Unicode
standard.

When text is rendered by a computer, sometimes characters are displayed as
"tofu". They are little boxes to indicate your device doesn't have a font to
display the text. Google has been developing a font family called Noto,
which aims to support all languages with a harmonious look and feel. Noto is
Google's answer to tofu. The name noto is to convey the idea that Google's
goal is to see "no more tofu". Noto has multiple styles and weights, and
freely available to all.
