@Don't force a RDEP on noto cjk fonts. chromium and iridium depend on
noto-fonts now, and it takes 70+ seconds on a 2.8GHz i7 to run fc-cache
with this installed, this is run at the end of pkg_add automatically,
and if you kill it X is broken until you clean the cache and repair
manually.

@Remove the Droid fonts; they've been superseded by Noto.

From https://github.com/googlei18n/noto-fonts:
"The Droid fonts are superseded by Noto. Noto began as Droid, and since
renaming all updates are made to the Noto fonts."

1.1.1.1
log
@Noto is a font family designed to cover the entire range of the Unicode
standard.

When text is rendered by a computer, sometimes characters are displayed as
"tofu". They are little boxes to indicate your device doesn't have a font to
display the text. Google has been developing a font family called Noto,
which aims to support all languages with a harmonious look and feel. Noto is
Google's answer to tofu. The name noto is to convey the idea that Google's
goal is to see "no more tofu". Noto has multiple styles and weights, and
freely available to all.
