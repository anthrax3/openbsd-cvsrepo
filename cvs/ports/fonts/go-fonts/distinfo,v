@Add a port for the Go fonts.

A family of high-quality WGL4 TrueType fonts, created by the Bigelow &
Holmes type foundry specifically for the Go project.

The font family, called Go (naturally), includes proportional and
fixed-width faces in normal, bold, and italic renderings. The fonts have
been tested for technical uses, particularly programming. Go source code
looks particularly good when displayed in Go fonts, as its name implies,
with things like punctuation characters easily distinguishable and
operators lined up and placed consistently.
