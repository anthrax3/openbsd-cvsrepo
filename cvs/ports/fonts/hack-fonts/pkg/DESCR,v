@Hack is a typeface designed for source code. The face has been
re-designed with a larger glyph set, modifications of the original glyph
shapes (including distinct point styles and semi-bold punctuation weight
in the regular set to make analphabetic characters less transparent),
and meticulous attention to metrics (including numerous spacing
adjustments to improve the rhythm of the face and the legibility of code
at small text sizes).
