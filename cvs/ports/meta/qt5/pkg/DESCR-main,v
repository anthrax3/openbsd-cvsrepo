@Qt is a cross-platform toolkit for developing applications,
mainly GUI-based.

There are some user documentation files in ${QT_DOC}, but
the main documentation is in the qt5-html package.

There is also a qt5-examples package, that contains tutorial, demos
simple example programs (source + binaries).

There's a debug version of the libraries: qt5-debug.

There are database plugins: qt5-mysql, qt5-postgresql, qt5-sqlite2 and
qt5-tds.

People who want to use Qt5 to compile applications outside the ports tree
should note that Qt5's installation conforms to OpenBSD habits, not
TrollTech's recommendations. Accordingly:
- libs are separated from includes.
- moc is installed as ${PREFIX}/bin/moc-qt5, in order not to conflict
  with other Qt versions.
- uic is installed as ${PREFIX}/bin/uic-qt5

Generally, it's just a question of invoking:

  env MOC=moc-qt5 UIC=uic-qt5 configure \
	--with-qt-includes=${PREFIX}/include/X11/qt5 \
	--with-qt-libraries=${PREFIX}/lib/qt5

... or, to force MOC/UIC in your make/gmake invocation:

  make MOC=moc-qt5 UIC=uic-qt5

will override the Makefile contents.

@Import meta/qt5, this will replace qt5, qt5-html, qt5-qch
and qt5-examples soon.
