@Leafnode is a USENET software package designed for small sites, with a
few tens of readers and only a slow link to the net.

It consists of several programs, three essential ones and several add-ons.

 - Leafnode is the NNTP server.  It talks to the normal news clients,
   and stores readership data.

 - Fetchnews is the NNTP news-gatherer.  It looks at the readership data
   Leafnode stores, and selects what groups to pull news from.

 - Texpire is responsible for deleting old and uninteresting news.  It
   deletes all discussion threads that are old and not recently read.

Leafnode is a simple NNTP server designed for small sites.
It "learns" which newsgroups should be downloaded based on what's
accessed.
It expires based on threads rather than articles.
