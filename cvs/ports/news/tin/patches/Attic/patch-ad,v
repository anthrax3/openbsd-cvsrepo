 .B tin
 is a full-screen easy to use Usenet newsreader. It can read news locally (i.e.,
-\fI/var/spool/news\fP) or remotely (\fBrtin\fR or \fBtin -r\fR option) via a
+\fI/var/news\fP) or remotely (\fBrtin\fR or \fBtin -r\fR option) via a
 NNTP (Network News Transport Protocol) server. It will automatically utilize
 NOV (News OVerview) style index files if available locally or via the NNTP
 XOVER command.

 At startup, \fBtin\fR reads in the configuration file. This contains a list
 of variables that can be used to configure the way \fBtin\fR works. If it
-exists, the global configuration file, \fI/usr/lib/news/tinrc\fP is read.
+exists, the global configuration file, \fI/usr/local/lib/news/tinrc\fP is read.
 After that, the users own configuration file is read from
 \fI$HOME/.tin/tinrc\fP. The global file is useful for distributing
 system-wide defaults to new users who have no private tinrc yet.

  When a user starts \fItin\fP it is possible to inform them of any important
  changes/information concerning the news system by displaying a message of the
  day (motd) file. The motd file should be created in your news lib directory

  The motd file will only be displayed if its contents is newer than the last
