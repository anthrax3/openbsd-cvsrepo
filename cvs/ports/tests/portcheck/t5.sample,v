@Stop whining about libiconv port module, and do not talk about
devel/gettext as MODULES item, only as RUN_DEPENDS.

A better solution is in works.

1.5
log
@Face the reality: portcheck(1) is heavily used now, and not only for new
ports. Given that you import port once but update it a few times, make
the update mode (-CU) default for portcheck, and provide a "new port"
switch (-N) instead.

This commit updates portcheck(1) and portimport(1): code, documentation and
tests. The WWW stuff will be updated separately.

Note: regression suite fails now as it detected an actual misconsistence
in portcheck's output. This will be handled ASAP, too.
