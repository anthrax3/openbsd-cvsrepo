1.3
log
@Face the reality: portcheck(1) is heavily used now, and not only for new
ports. Given that you import port once but update it a few times, make
the update mode (-CU) default for portcheck, and provide a "new port"
switch (-N) instead.

This commit updates portcheck(1) and portimport(1): code, documentation and
tests. The WWW stuff will be updated separately.

Note: regression suite fails now as it detected an actual misconsistence
in portcheck's output. This will be handled ASAP, too.

@Avoid false positives due to the difference in which files are picked up by
portcheck, by sorting the error output and comparing with (pre-sorted)
samples instead.
