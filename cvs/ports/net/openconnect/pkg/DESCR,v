@- introduce a flavour for a version of openconnect with fewer dependencies
(no smartcard/libproxy support, etc)

- update DESCR
@
text
@OpenConnect is an SSL VPN client initially created to support Cisco's
AnyConnect SSL VPN. It has since been ported to support the Juniper SSL
VPN which is now known as Pulse Connect Secure.

An associated project, ocserv, provides a compatible server which is
available separately in packages.

Features include:
- Connection through HTTP/SOCKS5 proxy
- Automatic detection of IPv4 and IPv6 address, routes
- Authentication via HTTP forms and SSL certificates (incl. from PKCS#11)
- Authentication via OATH TOTP or HOTP software tokens or Yubikey OATH
- Data transport over TCP (HTTPS) or UDP (DTLS or ESP)
- Keepalive and Dead Peer Detection on both HTTPS and DTLS
- Automatic update of VPN server list / configuration
- Roaming support, allowing reconnection when the local IP address changes
- LZS/LZ4 compression

Flavors:
	light - don't include libproxy, pskc or pcsclite support.

1.3
log
@Add a patch from OpenConnect upstream; "If we get an AC_PKT_DISCONN
message with no payload, just skip printing the disconnect reason."
Fixes printing junk and possibly crashing if the server goes away.

Tweak DESCR, mention the open-source server ocserv (port for this is
ready but holding in openbsd-wip until we're done with 5.7).

(Readers might be interested to note that 7.04 is probably the last
version of OpenConnect to only support Cisco's SSL-VPN protocol; the
next version will almost certainly add client support for Juniper's
protocol).

OpenConnect is a client for Cisco's AnyConnect SSL VPN, which is supported by
the ASA5500 Series, IOS 12.4(9)T or later on Cisco SR500, 870, 880, 1800, 2800,
3800, 7200 Series and 7301 Routers, and probably others. Like vpnc, OpenConnect
is not officially supported by, or associated in any way with, Cisco Systems.
It just happens to interoperate with their equipment.  Features include:

- Authentication via HTTP forms and SSL certificates
- Data transport over TCP (HTTPS) or UDP (DTLS)
d19 2

As well as the Cisco server, an open-source server is available (ocserv).

ok/tweaks jasper@@, and *big* thanks to upstream developer David Woodhouse
for letting me have access to his test server, noticing+tracking down
problems with vpnc-script when configuring v6 addresses on tun on OpenBSD,
and testing the fix for this on a range of OS.
