@update to v1.02
- works around Bash bug
- dnscache-conf now wants dnsroots from /etc, instead of /usr/local/etc.
  sigh.
  Work around this by instructing user to copy dnsroots.global from
  PREFIX/share/dnscache to /etc in pkg/MESSAGE.

Usage of /usr/local/etc is deprecated on OpenBSD. Use /usr/local/share
instead.

1.2
log
@- upgrade to version 1.01
  * Services now use envdir to set up environment variables such
    as $IP and $CACHESIZE, so outside tools can read and edit the
    variables.
  * dnscache discards non-recursive queries. There's a new dnsqr
    tool to send recursive queries to dnscache.
  * dnscache works around the Linux O_NONBLOCK kernel bug.
- remove PKGNAME, the distfile now has the correct name
- re-anchor patches
- add dnsqr to PLIST
