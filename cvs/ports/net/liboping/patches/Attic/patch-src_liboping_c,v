@Import liboping 1.8.0.

liboping was inspired by ping, libping and fping: It differs from these
existing solutions in that it can "ping" multiple hosts in parallel
using IPv4 or IPv6 transparently. Other design principles were an object
oriented interface, simplicity and extensibility.

On top of liboping two command line applications have been built.
"oping" is a drop-in replacement for ping(1) with very similar output.
"noping" is an ncurses-based application which displays statistics while
pinging and highlights aberrant round-trip times.
