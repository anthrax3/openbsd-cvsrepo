@Add perl to WANTLIB, second batch. This used to be done automatically but
since SHARED_ONLY support was removed across the ports tree the perl module
no longer adds it, so it must be done manually for any perl ports that
provide perl shared-library modules (i.e. libdata/perl5/site_perl/$ARCH/*.so)
and you must not remove them from WANTLIB even if they show as "Extra".

@Update to liboping 1.9.0

* liboping: The new "PING_OPT_MARK" option allows to mark packets,
  which can be used for filtering and routing such packets on Linux.
* oping, noping: The new "-m" command line option allows to set a
  mark on packets sent by the tool.
* oping, noping: The new "-O" command line option allows to write
  measurements to an CSV file.
* oping, noping: The new "-w" command line option allows to specify
  the timeout after which a packet/reply is considered "dropped".

1.1.1.1
log
@Import liboping 1.8.0.

liboping was inspired by ping, libping and fping: It differs from these
existing solutions in that it can "ping" multiple hosts in parallel
using IPv4 or IPv6 transparently. Other design principles were an object
oriented interface, simplicity and extensibility.

On top of liboping two command line applications have been built.
"oping" is a drop-in replacement for ping(1) with very similar output.
"noping" is an ncurses-based application which displays statistics while
pinging and highlights aberrant round-trip times.
