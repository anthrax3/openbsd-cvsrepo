@MessagePack is an efficient binary serialization format. It lets you
exchange data among multiple languages like JSON but it's faster and
smaller. For example, small integers (like flags or error code) are
encoded into a single byte, and typical short strings only require an
extra byte in addition to the strings themselves.

can be used by puppet to serialize data, however it's considered experimental
and therefore not added as a dependency yet.
