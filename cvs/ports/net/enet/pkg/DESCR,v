@ENet's purpose is to provide a relatively thin, simple and robust
network communication layer on top of UDP (User Datagram Protocol).
The primary feature it provides is optionally reliable, in-order
delivery of packets.

ENet is NOT intended to be a general purpose high level networking
library that handles authentication, lobbying, server discovery,
compression, encryption and other high level, often application
level or dependent tasks.

Cal3D is a skeletal based character animation library. 
It is platform-independent and not bound to a specific graphic API.
Originally designed to be used in a 3d client for the Worldforge project
(www.worldforge.org) it evolved into a stand-alone product that can be 
used in many different projects.
