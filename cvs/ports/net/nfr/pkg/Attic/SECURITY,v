Versions of NFR greater than 1.6.2 and less than 2.0.3
had an exploitable buffer overflow in webd, the built-in
NFR webserver. This hole was fixed in version 2.0.3.

The previous version of the OpenBSD port of NFR (1.6.2) 
was not vulnerable to this, as it used /usr/sbin/httpd by
default.

Security issues with the current version of NFR include:

	- sniffable cleartext authentication, since
	  webd does not support SSL

	- other potential problems with webd. It is enabled
	  by default, but may be replaced with another
	  webserver (e.g. /usr/sbin/httpd) in nfr/etc/nfr.conf

	- potential holes in NFR's cgi-bin programs
