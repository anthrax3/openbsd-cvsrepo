@CVSup is dead.  Remove the csup client, which is buggy and unlikely to

@csup is a software package for updating collections of files across
a network.  It is a rewrite of the CVSup client program in C.

Unlike more traditional network distribution packages, such as rdist and
sup, csup has specific optimizations for distributing CVS repositories.
csup takes advantage of the properties of CVS repositories and the files
they contain (in particular, RCS files), enabling it to perform updates
much faster than traditional systems.

CVSup is a software for distributing and updating collections of
files accross a network.  It can efficiently and accurately mirror
all types of files, including sources, binaries, hard links, symbolic
links, and even device nodes.  In addition to being a great
general-purpose mirroring tool, CVSup includes special features and
optimizations specifically tailored to CVS repositories.

Csup only supports checkout mode.
