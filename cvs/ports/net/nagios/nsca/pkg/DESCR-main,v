@The purpose of this Nagios addon is to allow you to send service check
results to a central monitoring server running Nagios in a secure manner.

nsca	- This program runs as a daemon on the central server that
	  runs Nagios. It listens for host and service check results
	  from remote machines (sent using the send_nsca program).

Please note: this package is only provided for compatibility with existing
NSCA setups and is NOT RECOMMENDED for new installations which should use
the NSCA-ng software/protocol instead.

@Recommend NSCA-ng as an alternative in NSCA's DESCR files. (if you have
spent more than about half a second looking at the code you'll know why).
