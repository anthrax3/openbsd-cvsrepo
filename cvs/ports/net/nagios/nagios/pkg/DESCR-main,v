@Nagios is a host and service monitor designed to inform you of
network problems before your clients, end-users or managers do.
The monitoring daemon runs intermittent checks on hosts and services
you specify using external "plugins" which return status information
to Nagios. When problems are encountered, the daemon can send
notifications out to administrative contacts in a variety of different
ways (email, instant message, SMS, etc.).  Current status information,
historical logs, and reports can all be accessed via a web browser.
