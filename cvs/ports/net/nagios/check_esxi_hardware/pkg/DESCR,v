@ESXi 5.0u1 responds *really* slowly to hardware status requests, this is
a vmware bug, until they get round to fixing it let's at least document which
icinga/nagios variable you need to bump as a workaround.  ok merdely@@

@This script is a Nagios plugin to monitor the hardware of ESX and ESXi
servers. It can also be used as standalone script to check the hardware -
Nagios isn't necessary to run it.

N.B. ESXi 5.0u1 hosts respond very slowly to hardware status queries
(http://kb.vmware.com/kb/2016538), as a workaround you may increase the
service_check_timeout in Nagios or Icinga.
