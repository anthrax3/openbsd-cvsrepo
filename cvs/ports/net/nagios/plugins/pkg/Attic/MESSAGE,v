@The check_dhcp and check_icmp plugins need to run with superuser
privileges. For security reasons they are not installed suid root
by default. If you want to use them, you have to either change
their mode manually or use systrace's privilege elevation feature.

For further details see ${PREFIX}/share/doc/nagios-plugins/README.OpenBSD.
