@drop tightvnc and allow ssvnc-viewer to replace tightvnc-viewer.

- tightvnc-server is based on a really old X release - it barely
works on i386, but doesn't support most X clients - and fails on most
other arch (it's neither LP64 nor big-endian clean).

x11vnc is a suitable alternative for some users, anyone interested
in the exact same type of functionality (standalone RFB X server)
should look at porting tigervnc.

- ssvnc-viewer is a significantly improved fork of tightvnc-viewer
and basically a drop-in replacement (same filename for the viewer).

ok dcoppa@@ and supported by weerd@@ and various ports@@ readers

@Update to 1.3.10, from Ian McWilliam.

(1.3.10 has a security fix in the Windows viewer; this does not
affect the unix viewer - this is not a security update on OpenBSD).
