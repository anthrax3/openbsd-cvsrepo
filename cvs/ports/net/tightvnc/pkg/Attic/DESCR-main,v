@drop tightvnc and allow ssvnc-viewer to replace tightvnc-viewer.

- tightvnc-server is based on a really old X release - it barely
works on i386, but doesn't support most X clients - and fails on most
other arch (it's neither LP64 nor big-endian clean).

x11vnc is a suitable alternative for some users, anyone interested
in the exact same type of functionality (standalone RFB X server)
should look at porting tigervnc.

- ssvnc-viewer is a significantly improved fork of tightvnc-viewer
and basically a drop-in replacement (same filename for the viewer).

ok dcoppa@@ and supported by weerd@@ and various ports@@ readers

@TightVNC is an enhanced version of VNC, which is optimized to work over
slow network connections such as low-speed modem links. While original
VNC may be very slow when your connection is not fast enough, with
TightVNC you can work remotely almost in real time in most environments.
Besides bandwidth optimizations, TightVNC also includes many other
improvements, optimizations and bugfixes over VNC. Note that TightVNC is
free, cross-platform and compatible with the standard VNC.
