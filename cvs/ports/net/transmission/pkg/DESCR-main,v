@Update through 0.81.  New features:
* The command line and GUI clients can now create .torrent files.
* The GUI client now allows selecting individual files for download
  from a torrent.
* A daemon client has been added that can run in the background.
  There is also a remote control utility that talks to the daemon
  as well as the GUI client.
