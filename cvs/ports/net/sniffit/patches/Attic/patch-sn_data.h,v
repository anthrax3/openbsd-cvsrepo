@Remove net/sniffit. The code isn't too pleasant, no privsep, hasn't
been touched in 8 years, upstream has disappeared, has a hardcoded
nic list missing almost everything modern, and doesn't build on
some arch.

@assume amd64 supports the same ethernet devices as i386
PS. this thing is stupid and wants a list of all of them hard-coded!?!
someone ought to at least update that list.
