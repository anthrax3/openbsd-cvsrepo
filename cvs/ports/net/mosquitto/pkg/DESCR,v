@Eclipse Mosquittoâ„¢ is an open source (EPL/EDL licensed) message broker
that implements the MQTT protocol versions 3.1 and 3.1.1. MQTT provides
a lightweight method of carrying out messaging using a publish/subscribe
model. This makes it suitable for "Internet of Things" messaging such as
with low power sensors or mobile devices such as phones, embedded
computers or microcontrollers like the Arduino.
