@ocsync is the ownCloud version of csync.

csync is a lightweight utility to synchronize files between two
directories on a system or between multiple systems.

It synchronizes bidirectionally and allows the user to keep two copies
of files and directories in sync. csync uses widely adopted protocols,
so that there is no need for a server component. It is a user-level
program which means you don't need to be a superuser or administrator.

log
@Since this is the ownCloud version of csync, force disabling libssh and
samba support which drops lots of dependencies.

@Re-import from net/csync and update to 0.6.0.
ocsync is the ownCloud version of csync.

Note that no @@pkgpath nor quirks will be added because the "official"
csync client may appear in-tree.
