@Remove patch which was removing various -W flags. The updated timestamp on
the file triggers an attempt to rebuild autoconf files, which breaks the build
if automake-1.11 is installed.  Worked out by Nigel Taylor.

Fix typo in DESCR while there.  The patch was there because these flags
broke the build in an earlier version of libnice, but are no longer needed
(checked gcc 3 and 4; port didn't build on gcc 2 arch anyway).  ok jasper@@

@libnice is an implementation of the IETF's draft Interactive 
Connectivity Establishment standard (ICE). It provides GLib-based 
library, libnice and GStreamer elements.

ICE is useful for applications that want to establish peer-to-peer 
UDP data streams. It automates the process of traversing NATs and 
provides security against some attacks.

Existing standards that use ICE include Session Initiation Protocol
(SIP) and XMPP Jingle.

@If using the 'VAR = value' contruct instead of 'VAR=value', use it
everywhere, for consistency.

Set this port SHARED_ONLY because it depends on gstreamer which is
SHARED_ONLY. Set configure and libtool flags accordingly. Merge
PFRAG.shared into PLIST.

Comment uneeded libtool generated files (the gstreamer thingy is a
loadable module, not a regular lib).

Remove trailing blank line from DESCR.
