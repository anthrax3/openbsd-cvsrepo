@If using the 'VAR = value' contruct instead of 'VAR=value', use it
everywhere, for consistency.

Set this port SHARED_ONLY because it depends on gstreamer which is
SHARED_ONLY. Set configure and libtool flags accordingly. Merge
PFRAG.shared into PLIST.

Comment uneeded libtool generated files (the gstreamer thingy is a
loadable module, not a regular lib).

Remove trailing blank line from DESCR.

@import libnice 0.0.9

libnice is an implementation of the IETF's draft Interactice 
Connectivity Establishment standard (ICE). It provides GLib-based 
library, libnice and GStreamer elements.

ICE is useful for applications that want to establish peer-to-peer 
UDP data streams. It automates the process of traversing NATs and 
provides security against some attacks.

Existing standards that use ICE include Session Initiation Protocol
(SIP) and XMPP Jingle.
