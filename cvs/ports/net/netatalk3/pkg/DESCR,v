@Netatalk is an OpenSource software package, that can be used to turn a
*NIX machine into an extremely high-performance and reliable file server
for Macintosh computers.

Using Netatalk's AFP 3.3 compliant file-server leads to significantly
higher transmission speeds compared with Macs accessing a server via
Samba/NFS while providing clients with the best possible user experience
(full support for Macintosh metadata, flawlessly supporting mixed
environments of classic Mac OS and OS X clients).
