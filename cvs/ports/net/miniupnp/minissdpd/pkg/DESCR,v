@minissdpd(1) listen to SSDP traffic on the network so miniupnpc(3) does
not need to perform the discovery process and can work faster to set up
a redirection. minissdpd(1) is also able to reply to M-SEARCH SSDP
requests on behalf on miniupnpd(1) or other UPnP server software. That
is useful in order to host several UPnP services on the same machine.
