@Remove ports/net/mrtd, it hasn't been updated upstream for 15 years,
has problems with long long time_t on 32-bit arch, seems likely to have
LP64 issues too (pointer/int casts), and missing license marker and
license files in the distribution.

claudio says, "I only used the mrt dump tools from mrtd and those are also
very outdated and at least for table dumps bgpctl is better". (libbgpdump
is another option for those).
