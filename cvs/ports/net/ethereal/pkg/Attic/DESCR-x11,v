@Remove ethereal from the ports tree.  Right during 3.5, it had more than
a dozen remote holes being fixed, that we shipped with.  Weeks later
things have not improved, and there continue to be problems reported
to bugtraq, and respective band-aids - but it is clear the ethereal
team does not care about security, as new protocols get added, and
nothing gets done about the many more holes that exist.

Maybe someone will at least privilege separate this one day, and then
the OpenBSD stance with respect to this may change.

Encouraging people to run broken software by distributing packages
with known security holes is not desired by any of us.

@Ethereal is a network protocol analyzer for Unix. It allows you to examine
data from a live network, or from a capture file on disk. One of the goals
of the project is to have an application that is similar in functionality
to Network Associates' NetXRay or the AG Group's EtherPeek. Although these
are both excellent products, neither of them runs under Unix.
