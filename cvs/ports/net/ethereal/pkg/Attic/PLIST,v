@Remove ethereal from the ports tree.  Right during 3.5, it had more than
a dozen remote holes being fixed, that we shipped with.  Weeks later
things have not improved, and there continue to be problems reported
to bugtraq, and respective band-aids - but it is clear the ethereal
team does not care about security, as new protocols get added, and
nothing gets done about the many more holes that exist.

Maybe someone will at least privilege separate this one day, and then
the OpenBSD stance with respect to this may change.

Encouraging people to run broken software by distributing packages
with known security holes is not desired by any of us.

@update to ethereal v0.9.0
--
Several new features have been added, including TCP graphs and ring buffer
captures.  The SMB dissector was completely rewritten and many enhancements
were made to the user interface.  The text2pcap utility can now handle a
broader range of input data formats.  The developer documentation also
received many updates.  Bug fixes include a workaround for an SNMP bug
present several Linux distributions.

Many dissectors were enhanced.  Support for the following protocols was
added:

    EAPOL
    M2TP
    MS RPC
    MTP2
    PCNFSD
    PPP/EAPOL
    QLLC
    SMPP
    SUA

Support for DBS Etherwatch,  Visual Networks Visual UpTime, and VMS
TCPIPtrace capture files was added.  Ascend/Lucent debug Etherpeek,
iptrace and MS Netmon capture file support was enhanced.

New dissectors include SUA Light, HCLNFSD, Rquota. Many other dissectors were
updated and bug-fixed.  The wiretap library can now read Etherpeek files,
and write NetMon 2.x files. Capture filters and display filters are kept in
separate dialogues/files to help minimize confusion. A new "Decode As"
feature allows some run-time configuration of which dissectors are called
for a particular packet. You can now click on a byte in the hex dump and the
appropriate field in the protocol tree will be selected. The display filter
code was re-written, and some syntax changed (esp. for boolean variables).

@update to v0.8.15. summary of changes:

Ethereal 0.8.15 has one of the biggest GUI changes in recent history;
display filters can now be constructed via an easy-to-use point-and-click
interface. Protocol dissectors now exist for: NFSv4, Mobile IPv6, X.25
over TCP, LAPBETHER, DEC LANBridge Spanning Tree Protocol, X.25 over LLC,
Frame Relay, MTP3 User Adaptation Layer, and ISDN Q.921 User Adaptation
Layer. Many other dissectors and core features were improved, and bugs
were squashed. The wiretap library can now read Sniffer Frame Relay files.
Capturing supports the "any" pseudo-device on Linux if you use libpcap 0.6
from www.tcpdump.org.

@Update Ethereal to v0.8.9. Also fix loading of plugings.
Release notes from the authors:


The dissectors for RTP, IP, ISAKMP, ICMP, SMB, SMB-PIPE, VTP, SNMPv3,
Ethernet, GRE, EIGRP, DHCP, IPX, X.25, RSVP, and L2TP have been updated,
fixed, or otherwise modified. Ethereal has new dissectors for Mobile IP
and COPS.

Internally, the dissector API has changed in order to catch more errors
at compile time and to guard against segfaulting when dissecting
short packets. The Ethereal team has to convert all the existing dissectors
to make use of the new API; that is a work in progress. If you have
your own dissector, you should consider converting it to this new API
as soon as possible. Read the doc/README.tvbuff file for information,
and be sure to subscribe to the ethereal-dev mailing list.

The Wiretap library can now read compressed Sniffer files,
allowing Ethereal, Tethereal, and Editcap to do so too. You'll also find
a few minor but helpful GUI tweaks in this version of Ethereal.

Change summary
--------------
In Ethereal 0.8.7 we have fixed a display bug affecting boolean flags
in bitfields that was introduced in 0.8.5. The DNS dissector avoids the
zlip DNS Denial-of-Service exploit.  Dissectors for rlogin and SOCKS
4 and 5 were added. Other updated dissectors include SMB, BGP, LLC,
OSI CLNP, and ISIS.
