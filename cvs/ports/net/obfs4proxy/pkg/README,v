To use obfs4 as a Bridge Client, please add the following configuration
to your 'torrc' config file:

	ClientTransportPlugin obfs4 exec ${PREFIX}/bin/obfs4proxy

To enable this Pluggable Transport in your Tor Bridge, use the
following configurations in your 'torrc' file:

	# Use obfs4proxy to provide the obfuscator
	ServerTransportPlugin obfs4 exec ${PREFIX}/bin/obfs4proxy managed

	# Enable Extended ORPort
	ExtORPort auto

	## (Optional) Listen on the specified IP:PORT for obfs4 connections
	## as opposed to picking a random port automatically
	# ServerTransportListenAddr obfs4 0.0.0.0:443

obfs4proxy is backwards compatible with obfs2 and obfs3 either in
client or server mode. If you want to use it like this, please adjust
your 'torrc' config file to fit your needs. It's compatible with
ScrambleSuit in client mode.

For more information, please consult the official wiki page at
https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/PluggableTransports/obfs4proxy

log
@Import obfs4proxy-0.0.7.

obfs4proxy is a tool that attempts to circumvent censorship by
transforming the Tor traffic between the client and the bridge. This way
censors, who usually monitor traffic between the client and the bridge,
will see innocent-looking transformed traffic instead of the actual Tor
traffic.

obfs4 (a.k.a. The Obfuscator) is a transport with the same features as
ScrambleSuit but utilizing Dan Bernstein's elligator2 technique for
public key obfuscation, and the ntor protocol for one-way
authentication. This results in a faster protocol.
