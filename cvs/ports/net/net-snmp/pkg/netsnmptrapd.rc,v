1.3
log
@Set pexp="${daemon}.*" for net-snmp; avoids a long delay at boot if the
user has set a command-line arguments containing '+' (not totally uncommon).
Otherwise rc_check() now waits for pexp to match, which fails due to
the + being handled as part of a regular expression.

1.2
log
@Run net-snmp as _netsnmp instead of root, doing this currently requires
disabling the ipv6 mib - this is done in the rc script so it can be
overridden with netsnmpd_flags if required (but just run snmpd from base,
really ....)

Reported by Pierre Kim.

Drop unnecessary patch while there, the problem it was meant to fix was
already fixed in 5.7.3.

1.1
log
@update to Net-SNMP 5.7 and clean up the patches a lot.

- rc scripts added (names suggested by Nigel Taylor, I was having
a hard time coming up with something nice that avoid a conflict with
base snmpd now the rc.d namespace is shared).
