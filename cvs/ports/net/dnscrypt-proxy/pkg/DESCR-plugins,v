@A collection of plugins for dnscrypt-proxy.

- example-ldns-aaaa-blocking: This plugin returns an empty response to
AAAA queries.

- example-ldns-blocking: This plugin returns a REFUSED response if the
query name is in a list of blacklisted names, or if at least one of
the returned IP addresses happens to be in a list of blacklisted IPs.

- example-ldns-forward-after-nxdomain: This plugin falls back to using
the standard resolution mechanism after receiving an NXDOMAIN response.

- example-ldns-logging: This plugin logs the client queries to the
standard output (default) or to a file.

- example-ldns-opendns-deviceid: This plugin is only useful when using
OpenDNS with specific routers and enterprise products.

@import ports/net/dnscrypt-proxy, from Frank Denis with small tweaks
by me, ok jasper@@

DNSCrypt-proxy provides local service which can be used directly
as your local resolver or as a DNS forwarder, encrypting requests
using the DNSCrypt protocol and passing them to an upstream server,
by default OpenDNS who run this on their resolvers.

The DNSCrypt protocol is very similar to DNSCurve, but focuses on
securing communications between a client and its first-level resolver.
While not providing end-to-end security, it protects the local
network, which is often the weakest point of the chain, against
man-in-the-middle attacks. It also provides some confidentiality to
DNS queries.
