@Update pkg-readme and rc script for dnscrypt-proxy; "-R opendns" was the
package's old default but this has been replaced in the csv file since
the OpenDNS acquisition.

There is now no default; select a server yourself and configure it as shown
in the readme.

@import ports/net/dnscrypt-proxy, from Frank Denis with small tweaks
by me, ok jasper@@

DNSCrypt-proxy provides local service which can be used directly
as your local resolver or as a DNS forwarder, encrypting requests
using the DNSCrypt protocol and passing them to an upstream server,
by default OpenDNS who run this on their resolvers.

The DNSCrypt protocol is very similar to DNSCurve, but focuses on
securing communications between a client and its first-level resolver.
While not providing end-to-end security, it protects the local
network, which is often the weakest point of the chain, against
man-in-the-middle attacks. It also provides some confidentiality to
DNS queries.
