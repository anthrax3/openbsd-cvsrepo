@In order to perform queries over DNSCrypt, using OpenDNS as a
resolver, the easiest way is change your /etc/resolv.conf file to:

nameserver 127.0.0.1
lookup file bind
options edns0

But DNSCrypt does _not_ cache queries. So the recommended way to use
it is as a forwarder for a DNS cache like Unbound.
Both can safely run on the same host.

@import ports/net/dnscrypt-proxy, from Frank Denis with small tweaks
by me, ok jasper@@

DNSCrypt-proxy provides local service which can be used directly
as your local resolver or as a DNS forwarder, encrypting requests
using the DNSCrypt protocol and passing them to an upstream server,
by default OpenDNS who run this on their resolvers.

The DNSCrypt protocol is very similar to DNSCurve, but focuses on
securing communications between a client and its first-level resolver.
While not providing end-to-end security, it protects the local
network, which is often the weakest point of the chain, against
man-in-the-middle attacks. It also provides some confidentiality to
DNS queries.
