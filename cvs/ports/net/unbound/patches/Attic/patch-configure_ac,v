- rc.d script now generates the unbound-control keys if they don't exist

1.1
log
@SECURITY update to Unbound 1.4.14, incorporating various diffs from Brad,
jakob@@ and myself. See http://www.unbound.net/downloads/CVE-2011-4528.txt
for more details, summary from the above is below:

--
Unbound crashes when confronted with a non-standard response from a
server for a domain. This domain produces duplicate RRs from a certain
type and is DNSSEC signed.Unbound also crashes when confronted with a
query that eventually, and under specific circumstances, resolves to a
domain that misses expected NSEC3 records.

These two problems were discovered within 24 hours, hence a combined
vulnerability disclosure.

By constructing the non standard responses an attacker can use these
vulnerabilities for a DOS attack.

To our knowledge 'denial of service' is the only type of exploit possible.
