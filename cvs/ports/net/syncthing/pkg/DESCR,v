@Syncthing is an application that lets you synchronize your files across
multiple devices. This means the creation, modification or deletion of
files on one machine will automatically be replicated to your other
devices. We believe your data is your data alone and you deserve to
choose where it is stored. Therefore Syncthing does not upload your data
to the cloud but exchanges your data across your machines as soon as
they are online at the same time.
