| Running ${FULLPKGNAME} on OpenBSD

Setting up a gopher site
========================

After installing the gophernicus package, edit /etc/inetd.conf and add
the following, all on one line:

gopher stream tcp nowait _gophernicus ${TRUEPREFIX}/libexec/in.gophernicus	in.gophernicus -h "hostname"

Replace "hostname" with the system's hostname, this should be valid
and resolvable as it is used to construct links.

inetd(8) must be reloaded (or started). To enable it at boot, the
following line needs to be added to rc.conf.local(8):
inetd_flags=

By default Gophernicus serves documents from /var/gopher and will
only serve files which are world-readable; being readable by the
server process is not enough.

For more information, see ${TRUEPREFIX}/share/doc/gophernicus/README.

@Import gophernicus 1.3.

The Gophernicus Project is a one-man mission to modernize gopher, the
precursor of the evil that is WWW.
