@BitTorrent is a tool for distributing files.  Whenever more than one
person is downloading at once they send pieces of the file(s) to each
other, thus relieving the central server's bandwidth burden.  Even with
many simultaneous downloads, the upload burden on the central server
remains quite small, since each new downloader introduces new upload
capacity.
