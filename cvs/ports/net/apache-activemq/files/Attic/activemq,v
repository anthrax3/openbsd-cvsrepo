1.2
log
@Revamp that port:
* don't use an /etc/default/activemq config file; it's too generic and
linuxish -- we'll use /etc/activemqrc
* no need to install the wrappers since we have rc scripts
* properly sample *all* configuration files
* run as unpriviledged user: _activemq by default
* remove useless README
* properly remove data files at @@extraunexec time
* proper rc_stop in the rc script
* take MAINTAINER
