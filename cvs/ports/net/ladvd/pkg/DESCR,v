1.3
log
@Update to 0.8. This update adds support for receive mode and other
nice features. Of note for OpenBSD users especially is the -z option,
which allows setting the interface description to what was received
from the connected switch.

Tested on amd64, sparc64 and vax.

With suggestions from Brad and sthen@@. OK sthen.

@LADVD is a daemon to handle link-layer advertisements on UNIX.
It can send and receive frames for the LLDP, CDP, EDP, FDP and NDP
protocols. These are used to inform devices about the equipment
on the other side of an ethernet link. This includes hostname,
port information and more. For example, a switch can display a
list of which device is connected to each port.

LADVD uses privilege separation; privileges are required to handle
raw sockets and certain ioctl()s. Network data is parsed by an
unprivileged child process.

Every 30 seconds the child generates advertisement frames reflecting
the current system state. Interfaces (bridge, bonding, wireless),
capabilities (bridging, forwarding, wireless) and addresses (IPv4,
IPv6) are detected dynamically. Secondly ladvd can listen for incoming
frames and utilize these for various features (protocol auto-enable,
logging, interface descriptions).

log
@improve pkg/DESCR wording and update to 0.6.1:

- support for OpenBSD's SIOCGIFDESCR
- support for hw.vendor and hw.product on OpenBSD
- manpage now lists default user (_ladvd on OpenBSD)
- location support also works for LLDP (-L)

from MAINTAINER Paul de Weerd, thanks!

LADVD uses CDP / LLDP frames to inform switches about connected hosts,
which simplifies ethernet switch management. It does this by creating
a raw socket at startup, and then switching to a non-privileged user
for the remaining runtime. Every 30 seconds it will transmit CDP/LLDP
packets reflecting the current system state. Interfaces (bridge,
trunk, wireless), capabilities (bridging, forwarding, wireless) and
addresses (IPv4, IPv6) are detected dynamically.
