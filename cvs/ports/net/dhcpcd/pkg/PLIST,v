@update to dhcpcd-6.10.0

http://roy.marples.name/projects/dhcpcd/info/595883e2a431f65d
- Ensure that option length fits inside data length less option size.
(can lead to an invalid read/crash via malformed dhcp responses)

http://roy.marples.name/projects/dhcpcd/info/76a1609352263bd9
- dhcp_optlen now returns the length of the data we can sanely work
on given the option definition and data length. Call dhcp_optlen in
dhcp_envoption1 to take into ensure these bounds are not overstepped.
Fixes an issue reported by Nico Golde where extra undersized data was
present in the option. An example of this would be an array of uint16's
with a trailing byte.
(reporter says "exploitation is non-trivial, but i'd love to be
proven wrong.")

@Add a README with simple example config for dhcpcd showing DHCPv6-PD use
over pppoe, fetching prefixes from upstream and assigning them to a couple

@import dhcpcd, from upstream author Roy Marples, ok (and tweak by) jturner@@

dhcpcd is a DHCPv4/IPv4LL/IPv6RS/DHCPv6 quad stack client.
It will listen for new interfaces and carrier signals from the kernel
so it can quickly configure each interface as it appears.

dhcpcd has a powerful DHCP expression engine which makes it easy
to decode future RFC DHCP options, or handroll your own.
