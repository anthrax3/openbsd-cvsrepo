DHCPv6-PD (Prefix Delegation)
=============================
As OpenBSD doesn't yet support DHCPv6 in the base OS, one common use of
this package is to request Prefix Delegation from an ISP, which hands you
one or more routable IPv6 subnet that can be assigned to interfaces
facing your local network.

Here is a sample configuration achieving this, fetching addresses over the
pppoe0 interface and assigning it to multiple local networks. In this example,
dhcpcd's router solicitation support is disabled (noipv6rs) - the kernel's
support should be used instead ("rtsol" in /etc/hostname.pppoe0). It fetches
addresses over pppoe0 and assigns them to "downstream" interfaces em0, vlan3
and vlan5. These interfaces are listed explicitly so that dhcpcd doesn't
touch other interfaces at all.
