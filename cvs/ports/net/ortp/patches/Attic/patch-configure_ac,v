1.2
log
@Update oRTP to 0.23.0. Includes some security fixes, and also incorporates
all local patches we had. The only new patch will be needed until
security/srtp gets updated. Major library version bumped because some types
in API changed (int -> size_t).

log
@Patch oRTP for getting proper random numbers through arc4random().

Patches for HEAD sent upstream. Take MAINTAINER as it's me who should be
blamed for problems now, anyway.
