@Update to oRTP-0.24.1, the older version doesn't build with newer libsrtp.
Presently not used in ports, this was imported for Jingle support in Kopete
but that is currently disabled there. "go ahead" zhuk@@

This disables ability to re-send events. If such functionality is
really needed, the security/libsrtp should be updated (from Git,
probably: https://github.com/cisco/libsrtp/).

1.1
log
@Update oRTP to 0.23.0. Includes some security fixes, and also incorporates
all local patches we had. The only new patch will be needed until
security/srtp gets updated. Major library version bumped because some types
in API changed (int -> size_t).
