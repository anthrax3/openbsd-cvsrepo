@Update to oRTP-0.24.1, the older version doesn't build with newer libsrtp.
Presently not used in ports, this was imported for Jingle support in Kopete
but that is currently disabled there. "go ahead" zhuk@@

log
@Update oRTP to 0.23.0. Includes some security fixes, and also incorporates
all local patches we had. The only new patch will be needed until
security/srtp gets updated. Major library version bumped because some types
in API changed (int -> size_t).

1.1.1.1
log
@Import oRTP, RTP (RFC3550) implementation library. This is needed for
Jingle support in kopete-4.11.3. The kdenetwork-4.10.5 could also use it
for the same thing, but my tests showed that Jingle doesn't work there, so
no point in enabling it.

oRTP - a Real-time Transport Protocol (RFC3550) stack under LGPL.
It implements the RFC3550 (RTP) with a easy to use API with high and
low level access and features:
  * Support for multiples profiles, AV profile (RFC3551) being
    the one by default.
  * A packet scheduler for sending and recieving "on time", according
    to their timestamp. Scheduling is optionnal, RTP sessions can remain
    not scheduled.
  * Mutiplexing I/O, so that hundreds of RTP sessions can be scheduled
    by a single thread.
  * Adaptive jitter algorithm for a receiver to adapt to the clockrate
    of the sender.
  * Supports part of RFC2833 for telephone events over RTP.
  * The API is well documented using doxygen.
  * RTCP messages sent periodically since 0.7.0 (compound packet
    including sender report or receiver report + SDES).
  * An API to parse incoming RTCP packets.
