@- install fping setuid root, it's a batch tool frequently used from
software which should not run as root, and doing this manually after
a pkg_add update is error-prone.

- rewrite DESCR. clearly note that the binaries are made setuid.

- Makefile de-uglification.

- bump PKGNAME.

no objections to the setuid change from ajacoutot@@, weerd@@

@fping quickly pings multiple hosts, specified on the command-line or
in a file, to determine their reachability without flooding the network.
Instead of trying one host until it times out or replies, fping will
send out a ping packet and move on to the next host in a round-robin
fashion. If a host replies, it is noted and removed from the list of
hosts to check. If a host does not respond within a certain time limit
and/or retry limit it will be considered unreachable. 

fping is meant to be used in scripts and its output is easy to parse.

N.B. The binaries installed by this package are setuid root.

     fping is different from ping in that you can specify any number of
	 hosts on the command line, or specify a file containing the lists
	 of hosts to ping. Instead of trying one host until it timeouts or
	 replies, fping will send out a ping packet and move on to the next
	 host in a round-robin fashion. If a host replies, it is noted and
	 removed from the list of hosts to check. If a host does not respond
	 within a certain time limit and/or retry limit it will be considered
	 unreachable.
