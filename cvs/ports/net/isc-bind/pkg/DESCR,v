@Add a no_ssl flavour to BIND.
Expand the comment about json-c as that's broken on mips64 as well as hppa.

@BIND is open source software that implements the Domain Name System
(DNS) protocols for the Internet. It is a reference implementation
of those protocols, but it is also production-grade software,
suitable for use in high-volume and high-reliability applications.

Flavours:
	geoip - build BIND with support for geolocation using the GeoIP api.
	no_ssl - build BIND without crypto support
@

@update to BIND 9.10.0 and add a flavour for the new geolocation support

@import BIND 9.9.1-P1 as ports/net/isc-bind - this is newer than the
version of BIND than is in the base OS (some people require features
from this version e.g. DNS64), but note that it does not include
the hardening changes made to the version in base.

@MFC req'd by jasper: SECURITY update to BIND 9.9.1-P3, fixes CVE-2012-4244
https://kb.isc.org/article/AA-00778

If a record with RDATA in excess of 65535 bytes is loaded into a
nameserver, a subsequent query for that record will cause named to exit
with an assertion failure.

This vulnerability can be exploited remotely against recursive servers
by inducing them to query for records provided by an authoritative
server. It affects authoritative servers if a zone containing this type
of resource record is loaded from file or provided via zone transfer.
