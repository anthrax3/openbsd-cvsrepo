@add pledges for dig/host/nslookup in the ports version of BIND. initial
pledge is "stdio rpath inet unix dns", dropping to "stdio inet dns"
after argument parsing.

access to resolv.conf is required late; the dns pledge is used for this
rather than requiring full rpath; however contrary to the version in
base, inet is allowed as well, so that it can be used as a debug tool
for servers on alternate ports.

works fine for me; no feedback after posting yet so committing to get
real-world testing. please report any issues.

log
@update to BIND 9.10.4-P6

* If a server is configured with a response policy zone (RPZ) that
rewrites an answer with local data, and is also configured for DNS64
address mapping, a NULL pointer can be read triggering a server crash.
This flaw is disclosed in CVE-2017-3135. [RT #44434]

* A synthesized CNAME record appearing in a response before the associated
DNAME could be cached, when it should not have been. This was a
regression introduced while addressing CVE-2016-8864. [RT #44318]
