1.1.1.1
log
@The anonymizing relay monitor (arm) is a terminal status monitor
for Tor, intended for command-line aficionados, ssh connections,
and anyone with a tty terminal. This works much like top does for
system usage, providing real time statistics for:

* bandwidth, cpu, and memory usage
* relay's current configuration
* logged events
* connection details (ip, hostname, fingerprint, and consensus data)
* ... etc
