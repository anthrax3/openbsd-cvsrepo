@Quagga is free software that manages various IPv4 and IPv6 routing
protocols.  Currently it supports BGP4, BGP4+, OSPFv2, OSPFv3, RIPv1,
RIPv2, and RIPng as well as very early support for IS-IS.

Quagga is a routing software suite, providing implementations of OSPFv2,
OSPFv3, RIP v1 and v2, RIPv3 and BGPv4 for Unix platforms, particularly
FreeBSD and Linux and also NetBSD, to mention a few. Quagga is a fork of
GNU Zebra which was developed by Kunihiro Ishiguro. The Quagga tree aims
to build a more involved community around Quagga than the current
centralized model of GNU Zebra.
