@This library has been designed to make it easier to access web services
that claim to be "RESTful". However a reasonable description is that a
RESTful service should have urls that represent remote objects which
methods can then be called on.

However it should be noted that the majority of services don't actually
adhere to this strict definition. Instead their RESTful end-point
usually has an API that is just simpler to use compared to other types
of APIs they may support (XML-RPC, for instance.). It is this kind of
API that this library is attempting to support.

It comprises of two parts: the first aims to make it easier to make
requests by providing a wrapper around libsoup, the second aids with XML
parsing by wrapping libxml2.
