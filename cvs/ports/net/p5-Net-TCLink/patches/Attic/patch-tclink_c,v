log
@Remove p5-Net-TCLink: old, insecure *and* broken company-specific software.

Uses SSLv3 only, does no certificate checking, no update since 2003,
regress tests don't pass, etc.  The company behind it restricts access to
data needed to make this port work properly in the long run.

Discussed with Chris Bennett, who doesn't use this port anymore but tried
to discuss with upstream.  Thanks!

@Switch from SSLv3 to SSLv23_client_method() for now.

It's still unclear whether this port actually works with this fix
applied, let's wait a bit for user reports.
