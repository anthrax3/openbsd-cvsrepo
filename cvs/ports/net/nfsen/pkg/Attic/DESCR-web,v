@update to NfSen 1.3.6p1, to go with updated nfdump
@
text
@NfSen is a graphical web based front end for the nfdump netflow
tools, allowing you to:

* Display your netflow data:
  Flows, Packets and Bytes using RRD (Round Robin Database).
* Easily navigate through the netflow data.
* Process the netflow data within the specified time span.
* Create history as well as continuous profiles.
* Set alerts, based on various conditions.
* Write your own plugins to process netflow data on a regular interval.

Different tasks need different interfaces to your netflow data.
NfSen allows you to keep all the convenient advantages of the command
line using nfdump directly and gives you also a graphical overview
over your netflow data.

This package contains the website parts (html, PHP, etc.)

@Import ports/net/nfsen, this companion to net/nfdump is a nice web-based
interface for working with netflow captures, including those from pflow(4).
See teamcymru episode 19 on youtube or the RIPE50 presentation slides to
get an idea of what it can do. Port requested by henning@@.
