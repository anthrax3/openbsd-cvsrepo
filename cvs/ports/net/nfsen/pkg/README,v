@Patch a problem with nfsen's install.pl that was introduced in the 1.3.7
update reported by mlnospam at yahoo.com

Garbage-collect pkg/MESSAGE while there. Most of the contents are already
in pkg/README and I've merged the other bit.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------
| Running ${FULLPKGNAME} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Note: the _nfcapd user has been added to group "www".

Basic installation
==================
To proceed with an installation or upgrade, adjust ${SYSCONFDIR}/nfsen.conf
as required and run the configuration tool:

# install-nfsen.pl ${SYSCONFDIR}/nfsen.conf

This will read the configuration file, create directories and files
as needed, and handle upgrades from previous versions.

It is highly advisable to read the documentation available at
http://nfsen.sourceforge.net/

Note, you may export netflow-compatible data from PF via pflow(4).

Chroot considerations
=====================
NfSen is written with chroot in mind and is capable of communicating
with the main nfcap daemon running outside the jail. Adapting to this
configuration is a simple matter of moving a few files around (while
the daemon is stopped).

# mkdir -p /var/www/var/db
# mv /var/db/nfsen /var/www/var/db/nfsen
# ln -s /var/www/var/db/nfsen /var/db/nfsen

PortTracker
===========
This optional module splits up traffic by port number. It can be useful
but is somewhat experimental. You can attempt to use it like this:

- uncomment the sample PortTracker entry from the plugin
section in the sample ${SYSCONFDIR}/nfsen.conf

- start nftrack: note that this will require at least 10GB of space in
the database directory. 
# su -m _nfcapd -c "nftrack -I -d /var/db/nfsen/ports-db/"

- restart nfsen
# rcctl restart nfsen

After the next processing interval, PortTracker should generate
data and graphs. If you have problems then examine system logs (you
may need to increase logging levels).

1.2
log
@Remove use of sudo from pkg READMEs in a few ports as packages and their
instructions are meant to work on a fresh install.

- easy cases: replace some '$ sudo somecommand' with '# somecommand'
(while there I've swapped some "${RCDIR}/foo start" with "rcctl foo start").

- replace some 'sudo -u user somecommand foo bar' with
'su -s /bin/sh user "/path/to/somecommand foo bar"' and similar.
Not pretty with the -s, but many of the uids that need to run
these commands have /sbin/nologin as their usual shell.
