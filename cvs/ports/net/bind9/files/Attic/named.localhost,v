--
BIND 9.1.0 has been released.  Compared to BIND 9.0, BIND 9.1 has a
number of new features as well as numerous bug fixes and cleanups.
The new features include:

  - Many BIND 8 features previously unimplemented in BIND 9,
    including domain-specific forwarding, the $GENERATE
    master file directive, and the "blackhole", "dialup",
    and "sortlist" options

  - Forwarding of dynamic update requests; this is enabled
    by the "allow-update-forwarding" option

  - A new, simplified database interface and a number of
    sample drivers based on it; see doc/misc/sdb for details

  - Support for building single-threaded servers for
    environments that do not supply POSIX threads

  - New configuration options: "min-refresh-time",
    "max-refresh-time", "min-retry-time", "max-retry-time",
    "additional-from-auth", "additional-from-cache",
    "notify explicit"

  - Faster lookups, particularly in large zones.
