@If you want to replace the OpenBSD named, use the following command:

	${PREFIX}/sbin/bind9-enable

PLEASE NOTE that even there is a bind9-disable command, it will only remove
the links created in /usr/sbin - NOT reinstall the OpenBSD named.

Sample configuration files can be found in ${PREFIX}/share/examples/bind9
and should be copied to /var/named if used.
