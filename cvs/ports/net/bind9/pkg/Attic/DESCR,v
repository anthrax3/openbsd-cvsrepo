BIND version 9 is a major rewrite of nearly all aspects of the underlying
BIND architecture. This re-architecting of BIND was necessitated by the
expected demands of domain name system growth, the need for secure queries   
and zone transfers as well as IP version 6.

@update to BIND v9.1.0. from release announcement:
--
BIND 9.1.0 has been released.  Compared to BIND 9.0, BIND 9.1 has a
number of new features as well as numerous bug fixes and cleanups.
The new features include:

  - Many BIND 8 features previously unimplemented in BIND 9,
    including domain-specific forwarding, the $GENERATE
    master file directive, and the "blackhole", "dialup",
    and "sortlist" options

  - Forwarding of dynamic update requests; this is enabled
    by the "allow-update-forwarding" option

  - A new, simplified database interface and a number of
    sample drivers based on it; see doc/misc/sdb for details

  - Support for building single-threaded servers for
    environments that do not supply POSIX threads

  - New configuration options: "min-refresh-time",
    "max-refresh-time", "min-retry-time", "max-retry-time",
    "additional-from-auth", "additional-from-cache",
    "notify explicit"

  - Faster lookups, particularly in large zones.

expected demands of:

a6 6
	- Domain name system growth, particularly in very large
	  zones such as .COM
	- Protocol enhancements necessary to securely query and
	  update zones
	- Protocol enhancements necessary to take advantage of
	  certain architectural features of IP version 6

These demands implied performance requirements that were not necessarily
easy to attain with the BIND version 8 architecture.  In particular, BIND
must not only be able to run on multi-processor multi-threaded systems,
but must take full advantage of the performance enhancements these
architectures can provide. In addition, the underlying data storage
architecture of BIND version 8 does not lend itself to implementing
alternative back end databases, such as would be desirable for the support
of multi-gigabyte zones. As such zones are easily foreseeable in the
relatively near future, the data storage architecture needed revision. The
feature requirements for BIND version 9 included:

	- Scalability
		Thread safety
	        Multi-processor scalability
	        Support for very large zones

	- Security
	        Support for DNSSEC
	        Support for TSIG
	        Auditability (code and operation)
	        Firewall support (split DNS)

	- Portability

	- Maintainability

	- Protocol Enhancements
	        IXFR, DDNS, Notify, EDNS0
	        Improved standards conformance

	- Operational enhancements
	        High availability and reliability
	        Support for alternative back end databases

	- IP version 6 support
	        IPv6 resource records (A6, DNAME, etc.)
	        Bitstring labels
	        APIs

BIND version 9 development has been underwritten by the following
organizations:

        Sun Microsystems, Inc.
        Hewlett Packard

@A port of BIND v9.0.0

	BIND 9.0.0 is the first "general availability" release of BIND
	version 9. It is aimed at early adopters and those who wish to 
	make use of new 9.0 features, such as IPv6 and DNSSEC secure 
	resolution support.
