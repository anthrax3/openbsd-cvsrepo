@Aguri is an aggregation-based traffic profiler targeted for 
near real-time, long-term, and wide-area traffic monitoring. 
Aguri adapts itself to spatial traffic distribution by 
aggregating small volume flows into aggregates, and achieves
temporal aggregation by creating a summary of summaries applying
the same algorithm to its outputs.
A set of scripts are used for archiving and visualizing summaries
in different time scales. Aguri does not need a predefined rule 
set and is capable of detecting an unexpected increase of unknown
protocols or DoS attacks, which considerably simplifies the task
of network monitoring.

Aguri monitors network traffic using libpcap(3), and produces a
summary when it receives a HUP signal. Periodic summaries can be
obtained by sending HUP signals from cron(8) to the running aguri 
program.
