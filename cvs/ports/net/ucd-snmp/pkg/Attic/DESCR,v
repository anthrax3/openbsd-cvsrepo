@This  is UCD SNMP, a derivative of CMU's SNMP package.  From
the README:

    This package contains a port and modified code of the CMU 2.1.2.1
    snmp agent.  It has been modified to allow extensibility quickly
    and easily.  It is far from the best and most configurable systems;
    but hey: its free.

    We use this agent here to monitor known system problems before they
    take the machine over.  The agent can be easily configured to
    monitor the number of a given process running, run external scripts
    to check and report functional status.  Examples: mountd(s) under
    Ultrix 4.3 which tend to fork themselves crazy and eventually fill
    up the process table; On our hp700s, "amd" sometimes stops working,
    HP VUE hangs and fails to start X, etc.
