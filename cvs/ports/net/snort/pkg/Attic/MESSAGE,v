@Update Snort to 2.9.3.1.

Thank you to all who tested: Markus Lude (sparc64), abieber@@ (macppc),
and Adam Jeanguenat (i386); I also tested on amd64 and i386.  Thank you
to Rodolfo Gouveia for help/tests on earlier versions, and brad@@ for
comments on an earlier version.

From Markus Lude (maintainer), and includes changes done based on
feedback from sthen@@ and myself.

OK abieber@@ sthen@@

@An up-to-date set of rules is needed for Snort to be useful as an IDS.
These can be downloaded manually or net/oinkmaster can be used to
download the latest rules from several different sources.

It is recommended that snort be run as an unprivileged chrooted user.
A _snort user/group and a log directory have been created for this
purpose. You should start snort with the following options to take
advantage of this:

  -c /etc/snort/snort.conf -u _snort -g _snort -t /var/snort -l /var/snort/log
