@Update to Snort 2.9.5.3, maintainer timeout

Re-enable support for non Ethernet decoders so that Snort can listen on
our pflog(4) interface again.

Tested on amd64 and i386.  Before the 64-bit time_t change, it was also
tested on amd64 and i386 (by myself and Adam Jeanguenat) and on macppc.

1.6
log
@Update to Snort 2.9.4.0, from Markus Lude (maintainer).

Notable changes:

* Consolidation of IPv6 -- now only a single build supports both
  IPv4 & IPv6, and removal of the IPv4 "only" code paths.
* File API and improvements to file processing for HTTP downloads
  and email attachments via SMTP, POP, and IMAP to facilitate
  broader file support
* Use of address space ID for tracking Frag & Stream connections
  when it is available with the DAQ
* Logging of packet data that triggers PPM for post-analysis via
  Snort event
* Decoding of IPv6 with PPPoE

This commit also includes a patch to snort.conf that was done by myself
with feedback from Markus.  The snort.conf patch ensures that Snort will
load the latest Snort ruleset since the rule files have been reorganized
by upstream.  It also excludes local.rules by default, since rule
managers like Oinkmaster skip that file when downloading rules.

Tested by Markus on i386 and sparc64, Rodolfo Gouveia on 5.2/amd64 with
his own snort.conf, and myself on amd64 and i386.

Thank you to all who tested: Markus Lude (sparc64), abieber@@ (macppc),
and Adam Jeanguenat (i386); I also tested on amd64 and i386.  Thank you
to Rodolfo Gouveia for help/tests on earlier versions, and brad@@ for
comments on an earlier version.
