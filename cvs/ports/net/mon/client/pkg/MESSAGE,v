@First import of mon.

mon is a tool for monitoring the availability of services, and sending alerts
on prescribed events. Services are defined as anything tested by a "monitor"
program, which can be something as simple as pinging a system, or as complex
as analyzing the results of an application-level transaction. Alerts are
actions such as sending emails, making submissions to ticketing systems, or
triggering resource fail-over in a high-availability cluster.
