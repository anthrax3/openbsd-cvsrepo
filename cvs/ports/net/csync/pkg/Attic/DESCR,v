@csync is a lightweight utility to synchronize files between two
directories on a system or between multiple systems.

It synchronizes bidirectionally and allows the user to keep two copies
of files and directories in sync. csync uses widely adopted protocols,
such as smb or sftp, so that there is no need for a server component.
It is a user-level program which means you don't need to be a superuser
or administrator.

NOTE that currently the owncloud module is commented in the PLIST
because there is something wrong with our neon library for webdav which
segfaults. I am working on this -- for now at least local and sftp sync
work fine.
