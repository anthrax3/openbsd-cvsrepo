@MFC SECURITY update to openvpn-2.4.2

Several security fixes after audits by Quarkslabs and Cryptography
Engineering.  At least:

  CVE-2017-7478 Don't assert out on receiving too-large control packets
  CVE-2017-7479 Drop packets instead of assert out if packet id rolls over

More details:

  https://community.openvpn.net/openvpn/wiki/QuarkslabAndCryptographyEngineerAudits
  https://community.openvpn.net/openvpn/wiki/ChangesInOpenvpn24

While here, backport a strict alignement fix from stsp@@.
ok danj@@ pirofti@@.  Also add a missing #include to openvpn-plugin.h, to
unbreak net/openvpn-auth-ldap build.
