for tbit and sting checks (these use an anchor so that scamper can control

@scamper is a program that is able to conduct Internet measurement tasks to
large numbers of IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, in parallel, to fill a specified
packets-per-second rate.

It supports the standard ping and traceroute techniques, but also Paris and
MDA traceroute, radargun, ally, mercator, sting, speedtrap, and parts of tbit.
