Merge two fixes from upstream git repository.

git commit a19567efa969835503823d6f6d193dcc83eb92ef:

Try to find best possible keyword for Kad search.
For example most user will search like this "The oxymoronaccelerator
2", which would ask the node which indexes "the". This causes higher
traffic for such nodes and makes them a viable target to attackers,
while the kad result should be the same or even better if we ask
the node which indexes the rare keyword "oxymoronaccelerator", so
we try to rearrange keywords and generally assume that the longer
keywords are rarer.

git commit 5cf7ef9a7dcff2776d9ebc8bb8337e7e3203e6ab:

Add a routine to set file name conversion for amuled, which is based
on wxAppConsole: fix sharing directories with non-ASCII names with
