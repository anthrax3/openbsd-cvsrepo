@Update for balance to 3.54

* A bug with hash_fold() regarding incoming IPv4 and IPv6 source
  addresses has been fixed. The "hash" group mechanism is now working as
  expected.
* Buffering has been disabled for interactive shell IO. A new
  "assign" command has been added to allow changing of the host:port
  assignment of a channel (only if disabled). A locking bug has been
  fixed.
* A new option -6 has been added to force IPv6 bind.
* Problems with setting IPV6_V6ONLY socket option are now handled
  more nicely with a syslog warning message.
* Balance now compiles also on systems where IPV6_V6ONLY is
  undefined (like some Solaris systems).
* IPv6 support on the listening side has been added. MAXCHANNELS in
  balance.h has been increased to 64.
