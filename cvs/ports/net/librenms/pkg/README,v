+-----------------------------------------------------------------------
| Running ${FULLPKGNAME} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

LibreNMS is primarily PHP-based, however it relies on running a number of
other programs during normal operation. As such it is not suitable for
running in the typical chroot jail used by default on OpenBSD (a chrooted
web server process is OK, provided that PHP is run separately, e.g. via
FastCGI, and PHP itself is not chrooted). 

System loads during SNMP polling can be heavy; beyond initial testing and
evaluation, it is probably happier run on a dedicated system.

Database configuration
======================
If the database will be running on the same host as LibreNMS, install
mariadb-server and follow MariaDB's pkg-readmes documentation to create
and secure an initial database.

On the database server, create a database and user account for LibreNMS:

CREATE DATABASE librenms;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON librenms.*
  TO 'librenms'@@'<ip>'
  IDENTIFIED BY '<password>';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
exit

Webserver configuration
=======================
LibreNMS should be run on a dedicated vhost. Sample configuration sections
for NGINX and Apache httpd 2.x are shown below.

If using php-fpm, disable any "chroot" line from ${SYSCONFDIR}/php-fpm.conf,
or add a new pool for LibreNMS which does not use chroot.

If using Apache mod_php, avoid using chroot.

If you wish to use memcache, install the pecl-memcached package.

Ensure that symbolic links have been created to enable the required
PHP modules; to do this in bulk:

  cd ${SYSCONFDIR}/php-${MODPHP_VERSION}.sample
  for i in *; do ln -fs ../php-${MODPHP_VERSION}.sample/$i ../php-${MODPHP_VERSION}/; done

Reload your web server and/or php_fpm so that changes take effect.

Sample NGINX configuration
--------------------------
server {
  listen	80;
  server_name	librenms.example.com;
  root		${INSTDIR}/html;
  index		index.php;
  location / {
    try_files	$uri $uri/ @@librenms;
  }
  location ~ \.php {
    fastcgi_pass	unix:run/php-fpm.sock;
    fastcgi_index	index.php;
    fastcgi_param	DOCUMENT_ROOT /var/www$document_root;
    fastcgi_param	SCRIPT_FILENAME /var/www$document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
    fastcgi_split_path_info ^(.+\.php)(/.+)$;
    include		fastcgi_params;
  }
  location ~ ^\.ht {
    deny	all;
  }
  location @@librenms {
    rewrite	^api/v0(.*)$ /api_v0.php/$1 last;
    rewrite	^(.+)$ /index.php/$1 last;
  }
}

Sample Apache httpd 2.x configuration
-------------------------------------
<VirtualHost *:80>
  DocumentRoot	${INSTDIR}/html/
  ServerName	librenms.example.com
  CustomLog	${INSTDIR}/logs/access_log combined
  ErrorLog	${INSTDIR}/logs/error_log

  <Directory "${INSTDIR}/html/">
    Require all granted    # for Apache 2.3 or newer
    AllowOverride All
    Options FollowSymLinks MultiViews
  </Directory>
</VirtualHost>

Initial LibreNMS configuration
==============================
After creating the database user account and configuring the web server,
it is time to install the database schema and make an initial configuration
of LibreNMS. This can either be done from the CLI, or by using the web-based
installer which carries out additional checks. Choose *one* of the following:

Option 1: CLI
-------------
cd ${INSTDIR}
$EDITOR config.php   # set database username/password etc.
su -s ${MODPHP_BIN} www ./build-base.php
su -s ${MODPHP_BIN} www ./adduser.php <name> <pass> 10	# 10=admin priv
su -s ${MODPHP_BIN} www ./addhost.php localhost public v2c
su -s ${MODPHP_BIN} www ./discovery.php -h all
su -s ${MODPHP_BIN} www ./poller.php -h all

Option 2: Web-based
-------------------
In order to use the web-based installer, you must first remove the default
configuration file:

rm ${INSTDIR}/config.php
chown www ${INSTDIR}	# allow the installer to write config.php
xdg-open http://localhost/install.php
chown root ${INSTDIR}	# protect again

Periodic tasks
==============
Cron jobs are used to discover and poll hosts, send alerts, and carry out
other housekeeping. Samples are provided in ${INSTDIR}/librenms.nonroot.cron
and should be added to /etc/crontab (creating the file if necessary).
The parameter to poller-wrapper.py sets the number of threads running
SNMP queries in parallel; you may need to adjust this e.g. if you fetch
results from many hosts and the queries do not finish in time, or if
the machine is getting overloaded.

Further configuration
=====================
See ${INSTDIR}/includes/defaults.php for additional lines that can
be added to ${INSTDIR}/config.php.

LibreNMS is capable of auto-discovery based on CDP/LLDP information from
supported devices (this is possible with many switches); if you have such
a switch and plan to use LibreNMS to monitor servers, running an LLDP agent
(such as ladvd or lldpd) as well as snmpd on servers will allow them
to be found.

Rotate LibreNMS' logs in newsyslog.conf, e.g.:

/var/www/librenms/logs/librenms.log     644  7     250  *     Z
/var/www/librenms/logs/daily.log        644  7     250  *     Z

Upstream documentation is present in ${INSTDIR}/doc and also online at
http://docs.librenms.org/.

@Remove use of sudo from pkg READMEs in a few ports as packages and their
instructions are meant to work on a fresh install.

- easy cases: replace some '$ sudo somecommand' with '# somecommand'
(while there I've swapped some "${RCDIR}/foo start" with "rcctl foo start").

- replace some 'sudo -u user somecommand foo bar' with
'su -s /bin/sh user "/path/to/somecommand foo bar"' and similar.
Not pretty with the -s, but many of the uids that need to run
these commands have /sbin/nologin as their usual shell.

@import ports/net/librenms, ok benoit@@ -- still a bit of a WIP, but usable enough.

LibreNMS is an autodiscovering PHP/MySQL/SNMP based network monitoring
which includes support for a wide range of network hardware and
operating systems including Cisco, Linux, FreeBSD, Juniper, Brocade,
Foundry, HP and many more. LibreNMS is a community-based fork of
Observium.

LibreNMS is not intended to replace a Nagios-type up/down monitoring
system, but rather to complement it with an easy to manage, intuitive
representation of historical and current performance statistics,
configuration visualisation and syslog capture.
