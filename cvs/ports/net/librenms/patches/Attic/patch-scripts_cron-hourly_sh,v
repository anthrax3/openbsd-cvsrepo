@update to librenms-1.24

reluctantly add a run dep on bash, it's getting to be a bit of a maintenance
problem to keep patching daily.sh to work with ksh.

@import ports/net/librenms, ok benoit@@ -- still a bit of a WIP, but usable enough.

LibreNMS is an autodiscovering PHP/MySQL/SNMP based network monitoring
which includes support for a wide range of network hardware and
operating systems including Cisco, Linux, FreeBSD, Juniper, Brocade,
Foundry, HP and many more. LibreNMS is a community-based fork of
Observium.

LibreNMS is not intended to replace a Nagios-type up/down monitoring
system, but rather to complement it with an easy to manage, intuitive
representation of historical and current performance statistics,
configuration visualisation and syslog capture.
