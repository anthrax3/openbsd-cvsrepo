@Using openfire in an OpenBSD environment

1) openfire requires a database.  If you intend on using the embedded
   (HSQLDB) database you may skip to step #2.  If you intend on using
   MySQL or PostgreSQL, instructions are available at:

    __PREFIX__/share/doc/openfire/database.html

2) openfire may be started by executing:

   '__PREFIX__/sbin/openfirectl start'

   as root.

3) After starting openfire, you may access the web interface at
   http://[hostname]:9090/

4) openfire's automated setup and plugin installation services require
   several directories to be writable by the _openfire user.  When you
   complete the installation process, you may wish to tighten permissions
   on __PREFIX__/openfire and its subdirectories.

5) openfire's DIGEST-MD5 SASL mechanism does not interoperate very well.
   If you experience issues with client authentication, you may need to
   force the SASL mechanism to PLAIN by adding:

   <sasl><mechs>PLAIN</mechs></sasl>

   to:

   __PREFIX__/openfire/conf/openfire.xml

   Then restart openfire for the changes to take effect.

- if you intend on using postgresql or mysql, see database.html for instructions
  on initializing the database
- sudo /usr/local/bin/openfirectl start
- lynx http://localhost:9090/ and go through the setup process
- login and try adding users, plugins, transports, etc

still needs some extra testing so it won't be connected to the builds just
yet. diffs & good error reports welcome.
