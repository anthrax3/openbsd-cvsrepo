 Pass a long that is a bitmask of options of how to deal with headers. The two
 mutually exclusive options are:
 
-\fBCURLHEADER_UNIFIED\fP - keep working as before. This means
-\fICURLOPT_HTTPHEADER(3)\fP headers will be used in requests both to servers
-and proxies. With this option enabled, \fICURLOPT_PROXYHEADER(3)\fP will not
-have any effect.
+\fBCURLHEADER_UNIFIED\fP - the headers specified in
+\fICURLOPT_HTTPHEADER(3)\fP will be used in requests both to servers and
+proxies. With this option enabled, \fICURLOPT_PROXYHEADER(3)\fP will not have
+any effect.
 
 \fBCURLHEADER_SEPARATE\fP - makes \fICURLOPT_HTTPHEADER(3)\fP headers only get
 sent to a server and not to a proxy. Proxy headers must be set with
@@@@ -44,7 +44,7 @@@@ headers. When doing CONNECT, libcurl will send \fICURL
 headers only to the proxy and then \fICURLOPT_HTTPHEADER(3)\fP headers only to
 the server.
