@Import rsnapshot 1.2.0

rsnapshot is a filesystem snapshot utility. It can take incremental
snapshots of local and remote filesystems for any number of machines.

Local filesystem snapshots are handled with rsync(1). Secure remote
connections are handled with rsync over ssh(1), while anonymous rsync
connections simply use an rsync server. Both remote and local transfers
depend on rsync.
