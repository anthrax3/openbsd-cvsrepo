+Mininet installation (and general) notes for OpenBSD
+----------------------------------------------------
+
+Currently, the only option is native installation.
+
+
+### Prerequisites
+
+This Mininet port relies on the native OpenFlow switch and controller,
+`switch(4)` and `switchd(8)`, respecitvely - meaning that it assumes that you
+are using OpenBSD 6.1. It also makes use of `doas` instead of `sudo`.
+
+
+### Installation
+
+If it hasn't been already, install `git`:
+
+    doas pkg_add git
+
+Fetch the repo and checkout this branch:
+
+    git fetch https://github.com/akoshibe/mininet.git
+
+The install script, `install.sh`, can be used to install the Mininet core
+libraries along with its dependencies. It must be generated first:
+
+    cd mininet
+    ./configure
+    util/install.sh -a #or with flag -n
+
+`install.sh -h` will give you all available options.
+
+To test the installation:
+
+    doas mn --test=pingall
+
+This will create a two-host, one-switch network and ping across the hosts.
+Alternatively, a `pingall` can be run from the CLI for a similar sanity check:
+
+    doas mn
+    mininet> pingall
+
+
+### Removal
+
+The Mininet core files can be uninstalled with the same install script:
+
+    util/install.sh -u
+
+This essentially undoes `install.sh -n` minus the package dependencies,
+which is the same as `doas make uninstall`.
+
+
+### Limitations and Bugs
+
+* The `iperf` CLI command is pretty unstable, and can hang or kill X.
+
+* The number of hosts (or nodes within their own 'namespaces') is limited to 255,
+  the highest ID that can be given to an rdomain.
+
+* Only the basic network elements (Node, Switch, Link, Controller, Host) are
+  supported, i.e. there are no NAT or any resource/bandwidth-limited elements.
+  Additionally, no work has been done to try to support non-native components such
+  as Open vSwitch or the many controllers (NOX, POX, Ryu...)
+
+* The `dpctl` CLI command (mapped to `switchctl`) isn't constrained to one
+  switch, so it will print the same text per switch.

log
@Mininet creates a realistic virtual network, running real kernel, switch
and application code, on a single machine (VM, cloud or native), in
seconds, with a single command

Because you can easily interact with your network using the Mininet CLI
(and API), customize it, share it with others, or deploy it on real
hardware, Mininet is useful for development, teaching, and research.

This port is not connected to the build yet.
