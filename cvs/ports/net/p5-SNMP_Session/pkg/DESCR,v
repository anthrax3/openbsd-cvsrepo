@Contains Perl 5 modules SNMP_Session.pm and BER.pm, which, when used
together, provide rudimentary access to remote SNMP agents.

This module differs from existing SNMP packages in that it is completely
stand-alone, i.e.  you don't need to have another SNMP package such as
CMU SNMP.  It is also written entirely in Perl, so you don't have to
compile any C modules.  It uses the Perl 5 Socket.pm module and should
therefore be very portable, even to non-Unix systems.
