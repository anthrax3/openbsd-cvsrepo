@Install p5-Net-SNMP to use the optional SNMP-based monitors.

Before starting munin-node, you should create symlinks in
${SYSCONFDIR}/munin/plugins as described in the manual (manually or
using the output from munin-node-configure --shell), adapt
${SYSCONFDIR}/munin/munin-node.conf if necessary (e.g. if a remote
server will query this node).

@import ports/net/munin, this was joint work with mk@@ and includes
a couple of his OpenBSD-specific plugins.

Munin the monitoring tool surveys all your computers and
remembers what it saw. It presents all the information in graphs
through a web interface. Its emphasis is on plug and play
capabilities. After completing an installation a high number
of monitoring plugins will be playing with no more effort.

Using Munin you can easily monitor the performance of your
computers, networks, SANs, applications, weather measurements
and whatever comes to mind. It makes it easy to determine
"what's different today" when a performance problem crops up. It
makes it easy to see how you're doing capacity-wise on any
resources.
