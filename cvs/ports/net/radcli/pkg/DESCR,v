@radcli is a library for writing RADIUS Clients. It aims to allow writing
a RADIUS-aware application in less than 50 lines of code. It is based on the
freeradius-client library, but legacy code has been removed; IPv6 support,
pkg-config, TLS/DTLS, and API documentation have been added. It remains
source compatible with radiusclient-ng and freeradius-client.
