@Import of wmnet-1.06.
Submitted by Vladimir Popov <pva48@@mail.ru>.

WMnet polls network statistics and does a few things with the data it gets.
It has small blinking lights for the rx and tx of IP packets, a digital
speedometer of your polled stat's current speed and a bar graph like xload
et. al which has a tx speed graph from bottom-up and rx speed graph from
the top-down.
