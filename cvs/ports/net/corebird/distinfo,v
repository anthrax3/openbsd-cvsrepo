@[UPDATE] net/corebird 1.3.1 => 1.3.3

port changes:
  - upstream now provides proper tarballs so we switch
    from GH_* vars to MASTER_SITES
  - we no longer need autoconf as the upstream rolled
    tarball includes the generated build files
  - devel/libtool & textproc/intltool no longer needed
    (spotted by fcambus@@)
  - simplified license comment (spotted by fcambus@@)

upstream changelog:
---
Version 1.3.3 (2016-10-01)

Changelog:
  - Support longer tweets in a few more places
  - Properly escape ampersand characters in user mentions to fix
    GtkLabel warnings about wrong escape characters in tooltips
  - Fix tweet length calculations for whitespace-only tweets
  - Check for duplicated entries in media arrays. This is apparently a
    problem on Twitter's side but led to crashes in Corebird (see #627)
  - Use the correct nsfw status of a tweet, i.e. the one that can
    actually show images.
  - Fix a crash when sending a tweet with multiple images attached
  - Fix tweet length calculation of quote tweets. This previously led to
    tweets getting rejected by the server even though Corebird claimed
    they were fine. See #628

Version 1.3.2 (2016-09-25)

Changelog:
 - Cope with the tweet length changes introduced by Twitter
 - Fix a problem with malformed media URLs

1.2
log
@Update net/corebird from 1.2 to 1.2.1

Upstream changelog:
  - Fix a11y labelling of several switches in the settings dialog
  - Fix an input window clipping bug in the tweet info page
  - Fix a few cases of overlapping widgets into window borders
  - Remove the "Save as" context menu from inline media. This ha
    not been working in a while but the context menu was still there.
  - Rename the .sidebar style class to .topbar. This was used in corebird
    before gtk+ used it, but now that the sidebar is at the top, the .sidebar
    style from gtk+ themes collides with the horizontal alignment we use,
    so use the more fitting '.topbar'.
  - Show a focus outline in the topbar again. We are setting a custom
    background color here, so we also need to set a fitting outline color.
  - Fix a coloring but in the topbar, where wildcard selectors in themes
    would overrde our foreground color.
