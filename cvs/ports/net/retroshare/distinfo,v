@Import RetroShare.

  RetroShare is an Open Source, cross-platform, Friend-2-Friend, and
  secure decentralised communication platform. It lets you securely chat
  and share files with your friends and family, using a web-of-trust to
  authenticate peers and OpenSSL to encrypt all communication.  RetroShare
  provides filesharing, chat, messages, forums and channels.

For those among us who trust huge C++ behemoths with their privacy,
or have friends and family who need GUIs to contact us.
