@Update to 3.1.0. This has various minor improvements, internal
changes, and now uses the system zlib.
https://rsync.samba.org/ftp/rsync/src/rsync-3.1.0-NEWS

Clean up some cruft:
* Dropped the -T from --with-rsh.  No tty allocation is the default
for ssh, and if somebody sets RequestTTY in .ssh/config, they should
get what they want.
* Removed pointless SECURITY file.
* Replaced the outdated DESCR text with the description from the man page.

@Rsync is a fast and extraordinarily versatile file copying tool.
It can copy locally, to/from another host over any remote shell,
or to/from a remote rsync daemon. It offers a large number of options
that control every aspect of its behavior and permit very flexible
specification of the set of files to be copied. It is famous for
its delta-transfer algorithm, which reduces the amount of data sent
over the network by sending only the differences between the source
files and the existing files in the destination. Rsync is widely
used for backups and mirroring and as an improved copy command for
everyday use.

Flavor: iconv
    extra dependency, for people wanting to bring files from other OSes with
    more versatile filenames.

Rsync is a mirroring tool that uses a brilliant algorithm for figuring
out a small difference set between files and sending only the difference
over the link, typically using a very small bandwidth compared to e.g.,
rdist.

Rsync communicates over a lower-level protocol, such as rsh or ssh,
allowing for secure updating.

On the down side, rsync is not quite as versatile as rdist when it comes to
mirroring only part of a hierarchy, though one can possibly use a perl
wrapper to obtain the same adaptability.

@All fixes actually entered into the main source.
Clean port, no patches.
Similar to rdist, but leaner, and works over ssh.
