@eDonkey2000 allows you to share and trade any type of file.

This is a gtk gui for edonkey. It can attach to a running edonkey
session. For that, you will have to start edonkey with the "-"
parameter to allow remote controlling the edonkey core.

It is strongly recommended to only attach to a running donkey on a secure
network, since the password is sent as clear text, and a donkey core can
be used to transfer more or less any file on that machine.

Due to a bug in the linux code, you will have to start the donkey client
manually first.
