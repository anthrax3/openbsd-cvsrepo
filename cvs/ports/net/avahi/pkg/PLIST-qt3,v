@- make this package use PSEUDO_FLAVORS so that one does not need to
build half of the ports tree just to build the main subpackage; this
change will also allow to fix the cyclic with gtk2-cups and qt-3+4
- move some files from -main to -gtk where they belong
- as a side note, only the -gtk subpackage is SHARED_ONLY now

@Import avahi-0.6.25

Avahi is a free, standards-compliant implementation of the Zeroconf
protocols Multicast DNS and DNS-SD.
It is a system which facilitates service discovery on a local network.
This means that you can plug your laptop or computer into a network and
instantly be able to view other people who you can chat with, find
printers to print to or find files being shared.  This kind of
technology is already found in Apple MacOS X (branded Rendezvous,
Bonjour and sometimes Zeroconf) and is very convenient.

Completely reworked from an old submission from jasper@@
Based on FreeBSD and pkgsrc.

Some successful test from marco@@, thanks ;-)

It will probably need a bit more love in the next few days.
ok landry@@ jasper@@
