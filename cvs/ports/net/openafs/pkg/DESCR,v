@AFS is a distributed filesystem product, pioneered at Carnegie Mellon
University and supported and developed as a product by Transarc Corporation
(now IBM Pittsburgh Labs). It offers a client-server architecture for file
sharing, providing location independence, scalability, security, and
transparent migration capabilities for data.

IBM branched the source of the AFS product, and made a copy of the source
available for community development and maintenance. They called the
release OpenAFS.
