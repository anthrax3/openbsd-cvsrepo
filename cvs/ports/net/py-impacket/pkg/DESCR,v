@Impacket is a collection of Python classes focused on providing access
to network packets. Impacket allows Python developers to craft and
decode network packets in simple and consistent manner. It includes
support for low-level protocols such as IP, UDP and TCP, as well as
higher-level protocols such as NMB and SMB. Impacket is highly
effective when used in conjunction with a packet capture utility or
package such as Pcapy. Packets can be constructed from scratch, as
well as parsed from raw data. Furthermore, the object oriented API
makes it simple to work with deep protocol hierarchies.
