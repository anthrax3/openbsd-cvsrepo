log
@- split pidgin into -main, -finch and -libpurple.
- add a patch that fixing linking with libpurple

this allows the use of libpurple by other IM clients, without the need of having pidgin installed.

some initial input from brad (MAINTAINER), timed out generously on the diff
feedback from ajacoutot@@ and sthen@@ , thanks!
