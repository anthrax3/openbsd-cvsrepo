@Mutella is a terminal-mode Gnutella client with an intuitive and easy to
use interface. Initially written by Max for himself, Mutella has now
been released to the general public for the benefit of all of us in need
of a solid, high-performance client.

Mutella supports all the functionality required to participate as a
full-featured node in the Gnutella network. "Full-featured" implies
support for file search, download and sharing.

Optimized for a high-bandwidth connection, it sets standards for the
server performance and stability. However, Mutella is also happy to run
on a modest-speed line.
