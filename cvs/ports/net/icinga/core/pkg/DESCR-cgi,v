The modern API-based frontend is also available in the icinga-web package.

1.1.1.1
log
@Import ports/net/icinga (with -I !, so the 'core' directory doesn't
become cvs-food). See the README file for information about migrating
from Nagios with minimal config changes.

The icinga-web API-backed user interface is a work in progress
and not yet linked to the build; the core program and classic web
interface are perfectly usable.

Comments/ok from pea@@, thanks for testing!

Icinga monitors network resources such as servers, routers, switches,
applications and services and notifies administrators or responsible
persons. It's a fork of Nagios and supports its extensive pool of
monitoring plug-ins. Current status information, historical logs
and reports can all be accessed via a web browser.
