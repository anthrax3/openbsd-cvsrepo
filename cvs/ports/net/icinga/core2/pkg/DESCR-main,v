@update to Icinga 2 v2.4.0, featuring a new RESTful API using basic auth
or client certificates for:

- filters, types, permissions
- query/create/modify/delete config objects at runtime
- status queries for global stats
- actions (e.g. acknowledge all service problems)
- event streams

@Icinga 2 is an open source monitoring system which checks the
availability of your network resources, notifies users of outages,
and generates performance data for reporting.

Scalable and extensible, Icinga 2 can monitor large, complex
environments across multiple locations.

* object-based, rule-driven configuration format, offering user-friendly
features such as "apply" rules for dynamic object generation.

* native support for Graphite, transmitting performance data directly
via TCP socket connection.

* REST API allowing access to objects and attributes and creation of
objects at runtime (without restart).

* clustering support for high-availability and distributed monitoring.

@Add upstream patches for Icinga2 so that opening a fifo doesn't block
open()s in other threads, fixing an issue where the daemon doesn't start
correctly when the command listener is enabled.

Many thanks to dnsmichi and gunnarbeutner from Icinga for tracking this
down and fixing it.

Icinga monitors network resources such as servers, routers, switches,
applications and services and notifies administrators or responsible
persons.

Icinga 2 is a parallel development branch to Icinga 1. Written from
scratch, it builds on the success of Icinga 1 and deals with shortcomings
inherited from Nagios as a fork.

* Easy to install with soft link activation of functions and packages
* Multithreaded and very fast: Capable of thousands of checks per second
* Intuitive to configure, using new object-based, template-driven format
* Easy to extend with native support for Livestatus and Graphite
* Cluster-enabled for distributed monitoring out of the box

Icinga 2 ships with all the functionality modern monitoring environments
need, while delivering unmatched performance, scalability and interoperability.
From Livestatus and performance data writers to IDO and cluster capabilities,
the above features are currently available in Icinga 2, with API / Agents on
the drawing board.
