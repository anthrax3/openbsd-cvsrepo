+-----------------------------------------------------------------------
| Running ${FULLPKGNAME} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Getting Started
===============

The following information only includes notes specific to use on OpenBSD.
Use them in conjunction with the main Icinga 2 documentation available
in ${PREFIX}/share/doc/icinga2/markdown or online at
http://docs.icinga.org/icinga2/latest/doc.

The included sample configuration carries out some simple checks
on the local machine; these should work as-is.

You may check your configuration file format before starting Icinga:

   # su -m _icinga -c "${PREFIX}/sbin/icinga2 daemon -C"

This will parse all configuration files and warn about any problems
which have been identified.

Enable icinga2 at boot and start it as usual:

   # rcctl enable icinga2
   # rcctl start icinga2

Web User Interface
------------------
The optional Icinga Web 2 user interface can be installed separately,

   # pkg_add icinga-web2

Consult the upstream documentation and the separate pkg-readme for
Icinga Web 2.

It is also possible to use Icinga 2 with the legacy CGI interface,
or with Icinga Web 1, however this has not been tested by the maintainer.

Upgrading from Icinga 1 or Nagios
=================================
Icinga 2 is not a drop-in replacement. Read the "Migration from Icinga 1.x"
and the "Differences between Icinga 1.x and 2" sections in the documentation.

Upgrading from previous versions of Icinga 2
--------------------------------------------
Follow the main documentation in ${PREFIX}/share/doc/icinga2/markdown/.

Upgrading from Icinga 1.x
=========================

Icinga2 is not a drop-in replacement for Icinga (or Nagios)!

Read the "Migration from Icinga 1.x" and the "Differences between Icinga
1.x and 2" sections in the documentation.

A migration script exists (see the "icinga2-migration" package), but it
has several limitations (see the Known Caveats section in the information
at https://github.com/Icinga/icinga2-migration). In most cases it would
be better to write a new configuration based on your existing one, rather
than try to migrate via the script.

documentation and the README for icinga 1.x.

log
@Remove use of sudo from pkg READMEs in a few ports as packages and their
instructions are meant to work on a fresh install.

- easy cases: replace some '$ sudo somecommand' with '# somecommand'
(while there I've swapped some "${RCDIR}/foo start" with "rcctl foo start").

- replace some 'sudo -u user somecommand foo bar' with
'su -s /bin/sh user "/path/to/somecommand foo bar"' and similar.
Not pretty with the -s, but many of the uids that need to run
these commands have /sbin/nologin as their usual shell.

@Update to icinga2-2.2.4. Change rc script to use "icinga2 daemon" and rc_bg to
force running in the background; it was previously using "icinga2 daemon -d",
but since 2.2.2 this has been hanging on OpenBSD.

Disable vfork as was done upstream on MacOS (to stop a hang there) in the
hope it may also stop a runtime hang seen occasionally here.

There are still some odd things going on and I don't think this is production-
ready on OpenBSD yet, so the warning in DESCR-main remains, but I think this
is not worse than 2.2.1.

Chroot Considerations
=====================

If you're using OpenBSD's default chroot environment for nginx, some files
will need to be moved inside the jail and symbolic links created.

   mkdir -p ${PREFIX-cgi}/etc ${PREFIX-cgi}/var/log
   mv ${SYSCONFDIR} ${PREFIX-cgi}/etc/
   ln -s ${PREFIX-cgi}/etc/icinga2 ${BASESYSCONFDIR}
   mv /var/icinga2 ${PREFIX-cgi}/var/
   ln -s ${PREFIX-cgi}/var/icinga /var
   mv /var/log/icinga2 ${PREFIX-cgi}/var/log/
   ln -s ${PREFIX-cgi}/var/log/icinga2 /var/log

To display times in your local timezone, you will also need to provide
a suitable /var/www/etc/localtime; due to the chroot, a symbolic link cannot
be used here, instead the file can be copied:

   cp /usr/share/zoneinfo/Antarctica/South_Pole ${PREFIX-cgi}/etc/localtime
@

A web-based user interface for Icinga2 is in development. Until its release
you can use the classic or the API based user interfaces. They are provided
in their own packages; one or both must be installed separately
("pkg_add icinga-cgi" or "pkg_add icinga-web").

1) icinga-cgi: the classic (but improved) Nagios-style interface

   nginx doesn't support CGI scripts directly; instead the slowcgi(8) wrapper
   must be used. Enable it at startup:

   # echo slowcgi_flags= >> /etc/rc.conf.local
   # /etc/rc.d/slowcgi start

   And add a configuration section like this to /etc/nginx/nginx.conf:

   location /icinga/ {
	alias		/icinga-cgi/;
	satisfy		any;
	allow		127.0.0.1/32;
	allow		::1/128;
	auth_basic	"Icinga Access";
	auth_basic_user_file /etc/icinga/htpasswd.users;
   }
   location /cgi-bin/icinga/ {
	satisfy		any;
	allow		127.0.0.1/32;
	allow		::1/128;
	root		/;
	auth_basic	"Icinga Access";
	auth_basic_user_file /etc/icinga/htpasswd.users;
	try_files	$uri =404;
	fastcgi_pass	unix:run/slowcgi.sock;
	fastcgi_param	REMOTE_USER $remote_user;
	include		fastcgi_params;
   }

   The example above permits access from the local machine without password,
   and requires HTTP basic authentication from other locations. The password
   file can be created as follows:

      # htpasswd ${SYSCONFDIR}/htpasswd.users <username>

   When done, reload the web server:

      # /etc/rc.d/nginx reload

   You should then be able to access the web interface at
   http://localhost/icinga/


2) icinga-web: new API-based interface

** N.B. These icinga-web instructions have not yet been updated for use with
** with nginx; 2.6 and 2.7 below relate to use with the apache-httpd-openbsd
** package. Please contact the port maintainer if you can provide suitable
** configuration sections to use icinga-web with nginx.

   2.1) Setup the icinga database. For details see:
   ${TRUEPREFIX}/share/examples/icinga/db/README

   2.2) Enable the ido2db daemon. Add "ido2db" to the pkg_scripts line
   in /etc/rc.conf.local _before_ icinga.

   Afterwards, you can start it by rebooting, or manually:

      $ sudo ${RCDIR}/ido2db start

   2.3) Enable the "broker_module=${TRUEPREFIX}/lib/idomod.so ..." line in
   ${SYSCONFDIR}/icinga.cfg and restart icinga:

      $ sudo ${RCDIR}/icinga restart

   Now you should see in the icinga logfile, that icinga is storing
   information in the db.

   2.4) Setup the icinga_web database (change the password!):

      mysql -u root -p <<EOF
      CREATE DATABASE icinga_web;
      GRANT USAGE ON *.* TO 'icinga_web'@@'localhost'
         IDENTIFIED BY 'icinga_web_password';
      GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, DROP, ALTER, INDEX
         ON icinga_web.* TO 'icinga_web'@@'localhost';
      FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
      \u icinga_web
      \. /var/www/icinga-web/etc/schema/mysql.sql
      EOF

   2.5) Change the db settings accordingly for both icinga and for
   icinga_web in /var/www/icinga-web/etc/conf.d/databases.xml.

   2.6) To enable icinga-web, link the provided httpd.conf snippet:

      $ sudo ln -s ../modules.sample/icinga-web.conf /var/www/conf/modules

   2.7) Currently, icinga-web is not tested to work in a web server chroot
   environment. You may have success by symlinking /var/www/var/www to
   /var/www (mkdir -p /var/www/var && ln -s ../.. /var/www/var/www).
   This topic will be revisited in a future version of this package.

   You should then be able to access the web interface at

      http://localhost/icinga-web/

   using user 'root' and 'password' as password. Change the default
   password in the preferences as soon as possible!.

   If you want to use the classic interface from within icinga-web
   you have to install the icinga-cgi package. The reporting component
   of icinga-web depends on external software which is not installed
   by default.
