@Remove patches from the icingaweb2 package that were hacking around the
mismatch between chrooted and non-chrooted paths (there are both CLI
scripts and a web app; both need to refer to the same paths and as well
as being complicated, the patches weren't quite working correctly,
as noticed by sebastia@@).

Now you must setup a symlink "/var/www/var/www -> .." instead as
described in the new version of the pkg-readme, allowing icingaweb2 to
always use /var/www paths whether inside or outside the jail.

Note: Existing users of this package will need to create that symlink too.

@$OpenBSD: patch-library_Icinga_Application_Modules_Manager_php,v 1.1 2015/11/16 20:30:34 sthen Exp $

Don't canonicalize /var/www/icinga-web2 as it undoes the work of the local
patch to ApplicationBootstrap.php to strip the chroot path where necessary.
