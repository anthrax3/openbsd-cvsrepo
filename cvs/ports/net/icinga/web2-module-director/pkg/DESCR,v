@add director module (config management/deployment) for icinga-web2
@
text
@Icinga Director has been designed to make Icinga 2 configuration handling easy.
It tries to target two main audiences:

* Users with the desire to completely automate their datacenter
* Sysops willing to grant their "point & click" users a lot of flexibility

It works via the Icinga 2 API, and provides audit logging, backouts and
restrictions, and allows both interactive use and a REST API that can be
used with configuration management tools.
