1.1
log
@Update to mosh-1.2.5

Remove patches committed upstream, and add a note about a regression
regarding JuiceSSH and mosh-1.2.5 (from sthen@@).  A similar update diff
was proposed by "Fred" (openbsd at crowsons dot com).
@
text
@N.B. At the time of writing, JuiceSSH's default server command is
incorrect for use with mosh-1.2.5. To work-around, add -s in
settings/mosh/Server Command.
