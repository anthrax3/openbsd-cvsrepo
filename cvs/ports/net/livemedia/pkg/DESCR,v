@This code forms a set of C++ libraries for multimedia streaming, using
open standard protocols (RTP/RTCP and RTSP). These libraries - which can
be compiled for Unix (including Linux and Mac OS X), Windows, and QNX
(and other POSIX-compliant systems) - can be used to build streaming
applications. The libraries are already being used to implement
applications such as "liveCaster" and "playRTPMPEG" (for streaming MP3
audio using RTP/RTCP). The libraries can also be used to stream,
receive, and process MPEG video, and can easily be extended to support
additional (audio and/or video) codecs. They can also be used to build
basic RTSP clients and servers, and have been used to add streaming
support to existing media player applications, such as "mplayer".
