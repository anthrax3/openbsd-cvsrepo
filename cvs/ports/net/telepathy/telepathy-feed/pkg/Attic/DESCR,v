Feed component for the Telepaty communications framework.
@


1.1.1.1
log
@import basic components of the telepathy framework.

The Telepathy project aims to provide a unified framework for all forms
of real time conversations, including instant messaging, IRC, voice
calls and video calls. It uses the D-Bus messaging system to provide a
simple interface for client applications, allowing them to quickly
benefit from Telepathy's functionality.
