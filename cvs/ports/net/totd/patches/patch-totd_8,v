 To enable 6to4 PTR query translation trick, add the `stf' keyword to your totd config file. 6to4 reverse lookup is based on draft\-moore\-6to4\-dns\-00.txt, section 3.3:
 .IP 
-     When such a resolver received a PTR or NS query for a label that had a [x2002].IP 6.ARPA suffix, it would first attempt to satisfy that query from its cache, or failing that, by forwarding the query to an upstream server.  If that query failed due to a "no such domain" error,the resolver would then attempt to find the server for the {something}.[x2002].IP 6.ARPA label by issuing an NS query for {something}.I N\-ADDR.ARPA.
