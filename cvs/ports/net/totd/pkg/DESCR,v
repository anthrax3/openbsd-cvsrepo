@clean up DESCR; faithd no more, mention af-to, mention DNS64 alternatives.
@
text
@Totd is a small DNS proxy nameserver that supports IPv6 only hosts/networks
that communicate with the IPv4 world using some translation mechanism, for
example application level translators such as the old KAME faithd(8) which
was formerly present in OpenBSD, and PF's af-to feature.

Note that for new configurations, it is generally preferred to use a
DNS64-capable recursive name server, e.g. later versions of BIND 9.

that communicate with the IPv4 world using some translation mechanism. 
Examples of such translation mechanisms currently in use are: 

   * IPv6/IPv4 Network Address and Packet Translation (NAT-PT)
     implemented e.g. by Cisco.
   * Application level translators as the faithd implemented by 
     the KAME project (http://www.kame.net). See faithd(8) on
     *BSD/Kame.
