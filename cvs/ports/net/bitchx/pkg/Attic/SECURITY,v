	Fix a buffer overflow in the DNS resolution code. A buffer overflow
	within the resolver code makes it possible to overwrite stack
	variables by generating a malformed DNS packet. This problem makes
	it possible to create a situation where a malicious user may be
	able to execute code remotely with the UID and GID of the BitchX
	client. It is necessary for an attacker to control their own DNS 
	to exploit this bug.
