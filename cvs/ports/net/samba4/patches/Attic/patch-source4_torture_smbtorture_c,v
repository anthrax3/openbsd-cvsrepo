@Bye bye net/samba4, thanks for all the headaches.

If you need details about how something ended up in net/samba, go look
in the Attic.

This code isn't needed at all because lib/replace/system/readline.h
automatically includes <readline/history.h> if supported, and it
breaks the build when devel/readline is installed.

@Import Samba 4.0.17 WIP port. In openbsd-wip for more than a year.
Most of work by yours truly, with help from kirby@@, ian@@ and others.

Notable change: libtalloc became a part of -util subpackage. Stuff
in this package has circular dependencies (at least, it was so
during beta times), so it's not possible to have libtalloc as
a separate package.

Now that Heimdal leaved base system, we could get rid of dirty, nasty
pool of hacks that renamed almost every symbol of bundled Heimdal.

okay ajacoutot@@, also support from ian@@ and sthen@@ at least.
