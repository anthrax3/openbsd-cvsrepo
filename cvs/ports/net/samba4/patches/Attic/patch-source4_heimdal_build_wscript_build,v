@Bye bye net/samba4, thanks for all the headaches.

If you need details about how something ended up in net/samba, go look

@Update to samba-4.1.18 and make samba4 close to usable

Notes:
- enable the use of -Wl,--as-needed, startup time is now "normal";
  spotted by Ian McWilliam
- ntdb is now enabled but gets merged into the -main subpackage, since
  upstream discusses its removal
- regedit disabled for now, because of a linker failure
- remove pidl Perl patches

1.1.1.1
log
@Import Samba 4.0.17 WIP port. In openbsd-wip for more than a year.
Most of work by yours truly, with help from kirby@@, ian@@ and others.

Notable change: libtalloc became a part of -util subpackage. Stuff
in this package has circular dependencies (at least, it was so
during beta times), so it's not possible to have libtalloc as
a separate package.

Now that Heimdal leaved base system, we could get rid of dirty, nasty
pool of hacks that renamed almost every symbol of bundled Heimdal.

okay ajacoutot@@, also support from ian@@ and sthen@@ at least.
