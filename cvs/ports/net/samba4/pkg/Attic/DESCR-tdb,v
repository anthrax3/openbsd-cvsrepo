@Use libtdb from databases/tdb instead of the bundled copy.

@TDB is a Trivial Database. In concept, it is very much like GDBM, and
BSD's DB except that it allows multiple simultaneous writers and uses
locking internally to keep writers from trampling on each other. TDB is
also extremely small.

@Import Samba 4.0.17 WIP port. In openbsd-wip for more than a year.
Most of work by yours truly, with help from kirby@@, ian@@ and others.

Notable change: libtalloc became a part of -util subpackage. Stuff
in this package has circular dependencies (at least, it was so
during beta times), so it's not possible to have libtalloc as
a separate package.

Now that Heimdal leaved base system, we could get rid of dirty, nasty
pool of hacks that renamed almost every symbol of bundled Heimdal.

okay ajacoutot@@, also support from ian@@ and sthen@@ at least.
