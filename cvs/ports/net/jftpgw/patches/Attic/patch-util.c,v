jftpgw is an FTP proxy/gateway that uses the FTP protocol (unlike those
FTP proxies that fetch an FTP file but work as an http proxy). You can use
it to make servers behind a firewall/NAT server (masquerading server)
accessible or to allow users behind such solutions to transfer files to
and from the outside of the LAN. With the sftp support you can also use
FTP to get files from a machine that is only accessible with an ssh
connection.
