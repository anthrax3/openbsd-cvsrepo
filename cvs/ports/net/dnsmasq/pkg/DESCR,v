@Update to dnsmasq 2.61.
Add rc.d(8) script.

from Brad

text
@Dnsmasq is a lightweight, easy to configure DNS forwarder and DHCP server.
It is designed to provide DNS and, optionally, DHCP, to a small network.
It can serve the names of local machines which are not in the global DNS.
The DHCP server integrates with the DNS server and allows machines with
DHCP-allocated addresses to appear in the DNS with names configured either
in each host or in a central configuration file. Dnsmasq supports static
and dynamic DHCP leases and BOOTP/TFTP/PXE for network booting of diskless
machines.

Dnsmasq is targeted at home networks using NAT and connected to the Internet
via a modem, cable-modem or ADSL connection but would be a good choice for
any smallish network (up to 1000 clients is known to work) where low resource
use and ease of configuration are important.
