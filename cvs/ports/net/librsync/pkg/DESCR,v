@Update to librsync-1.0.0, this switches default hash from md4 which is
susceptible to hash collisions. Tidy Makefile while there. tweak/ok jca@@

@librsync implements the rolling-checksum algorithm of remote file
synchronization that was popularized by the rsync utility. This algorithm
transfers the differences between 2 files without needing both files on
the same system.

librsync is for building other programs that transfer files as efficiently
as rsync. You can use librsync in a program you write to do backups,
distribute binary patches to programs, or sync directories to a server
or between peers.

librsync does not implement the rsync wire protocol or network functions.

This tree also produces the rdiff command-line tool that exposes the key
operations of librsync: generating file signatures, generating the delta
from a signature to a new file, and applying the delta to regenerate the
new file given the old file.

librsync is a free software library that implements the rsync
remote-delta algorithm. This algorithm allows efficient remote updates
of a file, without requiring the old and new versions to both be present
at the sending end. The library uses a streaming design similar to that
of zlib with the aim of allowing it to be embedded into many different
applications.
