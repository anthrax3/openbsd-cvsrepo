@Update to centericq-4.2.1

As Mirabilis servers have problems w/ v7 protocol, all the Unix ICQ
clients work very unstable nowadays - some messages never arrive, or
get delivered over an incredible amount of time, etc.  Until there is
a good free library for icq2000 protocol, the centericq author
implemented other IM protocols in the client.  With this version, Yahoo
and MSN protocol support are introduced.

@MAINTAINER=     Peter Valchev <pvalchev@@toxiclinux.org>

A curses-based textmode ICQ client implementation. It is a
fully featured client, can do things like file transfer. Has
the ability to associate sounds with different actions/evens
and play them through a sound card, as well as the standart
beeping.
 
Things like colors are not hard-coded in the program itself,
but can be set in the corresponding config files
