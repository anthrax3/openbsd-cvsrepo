controlled in the ~/.centericq/actions file.
o Cancelled messages are now being postponed for later editing.
o Substring search in history is implemented.

1.1.1.1
log
@MAINTAINER=     Peter Valchev <pvalchev@@toxiclinux.org>

A curses-based textmode ICQ client implementation. It is a
fully featured client, can do things like file transfer. Has
the ability to associate sounds with different actions/evens
and play them through a sound card, as well as the standart
beeping.
 
Things like colors are not hard-coded in the program itself,
but can be set in the corresponding config files
