@Update to centericq-4.5.0

This release adds a very important improvement. ICQ communications were
moved to the library of ickle client, written by Barnaby Gray
<barnaby@@beedesign.co.uk>. Since the library supports the icq2000
protocol, this version centericq doesn't loose messages unlike previous
ones. Also it's now possible to send SMSes. Though, the library is not
complete yet, so features such as finding users, updating details,
sending contacts and files are now gone. Temporary.
