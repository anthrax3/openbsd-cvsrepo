OpenVMPS is a substitute implementation of Cisco Virtual Membership
Policy Server (on Catalyst [65]500 family of switches).
It is used on Cisco LAN switches to dynamically assign ports to VLANs
according to Ethernet Address.
Because it was developed solely on infomation obtained by observing the
network traffic between switches it is probably not complete but it is a
working subset of the protocol.

Note that it includes a patch from openvpms CVS that fixes a logging
function format string Vulnerability.
