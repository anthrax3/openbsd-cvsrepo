NmapFE is a frontend for the much loved scanner Nmap. 
Nmap is a portscanner that is able to do remote OS
detection via TCP/IP fingerprinting as well. You can
use Nmap to scan a large network, or a single host.
This frontend provides a simple GUI interface to the
complexity of Nmap. The GUI supports color coding for
various services, and enables you to append one scan
to the end of others, to create somewhat of a database
of scans.
