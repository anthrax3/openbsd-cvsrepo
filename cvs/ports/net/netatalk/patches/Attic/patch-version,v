@patch-etcafpd-authc
more syslogging of login failures so we have have more info on why.

patch-etcafpd-volumec
Update to partially resolve the current problem with afpd not behaving
correctly with permisions on /etc/netatalk.

Log correctly to /var/log/daemon when we can't access configuration files.
Put in place proper error checking when reading them. Would be nice if the
origional programmers actually checked for failure for anything.
People can now see just why things are not working as they like.

/etc/netatalk/AppleVolumes.system: Permission denied
Mar 29 18:08:40 kashmir afpd[6210]: done

Pass the CORRECT arguments to creatvol. from "Benninghoff, John"
<JABenninghoff@@dainrauscher.com>

Return AFPERR_PARAM when we can't access configuration files to
the appleshare client requesting access. This stops possible DOS under
MacOS. In it's current form the Appleshare client has to be killed on the
MAC side by killing the "CHOOSER" Application. By returning proper errors
the appleshare client exits gracefully with error: "An Appleshare system
error occured."

patch-etcpapd-lpc
cosmetic change: remove an unused variable.

patch-version
changes made bump version.
