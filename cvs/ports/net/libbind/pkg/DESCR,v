@step up the warning about only using libbind for special use cases.

@This package provides the ISC libbind DNS resolver.

This port is not for general purpose use and has known issues; it is
intended *only* for special cases where software relies on resolver
internals and cannot be adapted to the standard resolver in libc
or use an alternative library. There are symbol conflicts; expect
crashes and corruption in some cases.

ISC's libbind provides the standard resolver library, along with header
files and documentation, for communicating with domain name servers,
retrieving network host entries from /etc/hosts or via DNS, converting
CIDR network addresses, performing Hesiod information lookups,
retrieving network entries from /etc/networks, implementing TSIG
transaction/request security of DNS messages, performing name-to-address
and address-to-name translations, and utilizing /etc/resolv.conf for
resolver configuration.
