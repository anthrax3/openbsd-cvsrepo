@The portable SDK for UPnP Devices (libupnp) provides developers with an
API and open source code for building control points, devices, and
bridges that are compliant with Version 1.0 of the Universal Plug and
Play Device Architecture Specification.

UPnP is an architecture that enables discovery, event notification, and
control of devices on a network, independent of operating system,
programming language, or physical network connection. UPnP is based on
common Internet standards and specifications such as TCP/IP, HTTP, and
XML.
