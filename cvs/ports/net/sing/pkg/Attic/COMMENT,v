@import of sing 1.0

Sing is a little tool that sends ICMP packets fully customized from 
command line.  The main purpose is to replace/complement the niceful
ping command with certain enhancements as:

 o Send fragmented packets.
 o Send monster packets > 65534.
 o Send/read spoofed packets.
 o Send	many ICMP Information types in addition to the ECHO REQUEST
   type sent by default as Address Mask Request, Timestamp, Information
   Request, Router Solicitation and Router Advertisement.
 o Send many ICMP error types: Redirect, Source Quench, Time Exceeded, 
   Destination Unreach and Parameter Problem.
 o Send to host with Loose or Strict Source Routing.
 o Use little fingerprinting techniques to discover Window$ or Solaris
   boxes.
 o Send ICMP packets emulating certain OS: Cisco, Solaris, Linux, Shiva,
   Unix and Window$ at the moment.
