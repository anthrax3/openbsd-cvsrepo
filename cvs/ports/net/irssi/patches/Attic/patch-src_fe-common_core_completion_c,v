@Various tweaks to the irssi port, from Brad. Tested by a few people,
viq (maintainer) doesn't have time to look at it properly but is
generally ok with this.

- Remove USE_GROFF
- Remove --enable-ipv6 from CONFIGURE_ARGS since its enabled by default
- Backport fixes from SVN repo..
  - Replace deprecated glib functions
  - Do not go beyond the end of the string when processing an octal escape
  - glib iochannel fixes
  - Fix segfault generated by SSL disconnections
  - Do not use SSLv2 protocol
  - When sending a signal to an /exec'd command, send it to the process
    group id instead of the process id.
