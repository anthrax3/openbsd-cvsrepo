@update to irssi-0.8.17, diff came from maintainer some time ago, but there
were problems with irssi-icb (will be fixed in following commit). I made some
small changes from the earlier diff: add PKGSPEC so that plugins pick up the
correct version of irssi, use a better license marker, and install the
irssi-config script that irssi-icb looks for.
