@Irssi is a modular IRC client that currently has only text mode
user interface, but 80-90% of the code isn't text mode specific,
so other UIs could be created pretty easily. Also, Irssi isn't
really even IRC specific anymore, there's already a working SILC
module available at net/irssi-silc. Support for other protocols
like ICQ could be created some day too.

Flavor:	socks support for dante socks firewall implementation

@Update irssi to version 0.8.9
--
This release fixes a bug that could lead to a remote crash.
Users using irssi on non x86 arches are urged to upgrade.
Also fixes a bug in window layout restoring queries that could
also cause a crash in all arches.

Based on submission from Robert Nagy <thuglife@@bsd.hu> with mods
from me.
