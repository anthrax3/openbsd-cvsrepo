@Poezio is a console Jabber/XMPP client. Its goal is to use anonymous connections
to simply let the user join MultiUserChats. This way, the user doesn’t have to
create a Jabber account, exactly like people are using IRC. Poezio’s commands
are designed to be (if possible) like commonly used IRC clients (weechat, irssi,
etc).
