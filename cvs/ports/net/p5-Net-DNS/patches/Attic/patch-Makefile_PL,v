@update to p5-Net-DNS-0.26
+ Fixed warning in Net::DNS::RR::AUTOLOAD with perl 5.005.
+ Implemented autoloading of the RR subclasses.  This provides a
  good sized speed bump, particually for applications that are not
  persisant.
+ Cleaned up a few things with CERT RRs.
+ Removed use of $' from RR.pm for effciency reasons.  As a result,
  for all RRs text following a ';' is considered a comment.  This
  was originally only done in RR/SOA.pm.
+ Added method caching to AUTOLOAD subroutines.  This should provide
  a modest speed bump.
+ The test suite has been greatly improved, though there is still
  more to be done in this regard.
+ Added support for DNAME resource records.
+ Fixed edge case for queries that have no name.
+ Tighted up the regular expression used in Net::DNS::Resolver::cname_addr()
