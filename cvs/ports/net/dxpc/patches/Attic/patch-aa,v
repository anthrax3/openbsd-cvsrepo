@Update dxpc to 3.8.0.

This is needed for inter-operability with other systems, as 3.7.0 and
3.8.0 don't talk together.

Also, 3.8.0 fixes some important bugs, and it compresses bitmaps, which
means it can be used in various situations where it was completely useless
before.

@Fix up brain-damaged test for accept third argument.

This makes that port require autoconf, until the dxpc people mend their
ways.
