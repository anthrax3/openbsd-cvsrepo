@websocketd is a small command-line tool that will wrap an existing command-line
interface program, and allow it to be accessed via a WebSocket.

WebSocket-capable applications can now be built very easily in any language. As
long as you can write an executable program that reads `STDIN` and writes to
`STDOUT`, you can build a WebSocket server.
