1.3
log
@Update to 0.24.9.  Changes since the previous release include:

* cvsup2cvsync, which is a utility to convert a CVSup(R) scanfile into
  a cvsync counterpart, has been added.  When the upstream server
  is using CVSup and you want to redistribute the contents using CVSync,
  this tool is your friend.

* Support poll() instead of select() if available (server/client).

* cvsync(1) now supports "refuse" file.  Using the refuse file,
  you can prevent files/directories in a collection from
  adding/updating/removing on the client side.
