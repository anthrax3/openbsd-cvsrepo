1.1.1.1
log
@Angst is an active sniffer, based on libpcap and libnet.
Angst provides methods for aggressive sniffing on switched
local area network environments.

It dumps the payload of all the TCP packets received on the
specified ports.  Moreover, it implements methods for active
sniffing.  Angst currently provides two active sniffing methods.
The first monitors ARP requests, and after enabling IP
forwarding on the local host, sends ARP replies mapping all IPs
to the local MAC address.  The second method floods the local
network with random MAC addresses (like macof v1.1 by Ian Vitek),
causing switches to send packets to all ports.  Made just for
testing purposes and fun.  If you compile it on any other
platform except the ones listed below, please contact me at the
above email address.  As always, published under a BSD style
license, see the included LICENSE file.
