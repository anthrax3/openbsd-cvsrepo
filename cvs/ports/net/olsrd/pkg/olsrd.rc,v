1.1
log
@Update our very much outdated net/olsrd port to current release 0.9.0.3.
Add patches for rdomain support and a few bug fixes.
Roll the -plugins subpackage into -main, and add an rc.d script.

Lightly tested in Berlin's Freifunk OLSR mesh over ral(4) in IBSS mode.

martin@@ has rescinded maintainership which I am taking over.
