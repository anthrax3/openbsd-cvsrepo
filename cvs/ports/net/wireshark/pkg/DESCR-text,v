@Import wireshark 1.10.8, mostly from nigel@@
Has been in -wip for years, tested by lots of ppl there.

Wireshark is a network capture tool and protocol analyzer, including
decoders for very many common and less-common protocols.

Packet dissectors (here in Wireshark, and in other programs such as tcpdump)
have a long history of security problems (but so do other programs in the
portstree..). In wireshark, these are isolated from the packet capture
code (which must have root privileges) by using a separate program,
dumpcap, to run the capture. It is installed setuid root, with
read/execute access granted only to users in the _wireshark group.

Wireshark itself doesn't need privileges if you only plan to analyse
traces produced by tcpdump.

DO NOT RUN WIRESHARK AS ROOT.
