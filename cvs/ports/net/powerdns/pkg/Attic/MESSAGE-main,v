@From Brad:

- Update the autoconf script now that our gcc properly obeys -rdynamic
- Improve patch for dns.hh header

From me:

- Add an rc script

@To start the powerdns server at boot time, add the following to
/etc/rc.local:

if [ -x ${PREFIX}/sbin/pdns_server ]; then
        echo -n ' pdns_server';       ${PREFIX}/sbin/pdns_server \
		--daemon=yes --guardian=no --control-console --loglevel=9

An autogenerated configuration file has been installed into:
${PREFIX}/share/examples/pdns/pdns.conf-dist

For a quick-start ${SYSCONFDIR}/pdns/pdns.conf has been provided.

@import powerdns 2.9.21.1

pdnsd is a proxy dns server with permanent caching (the cache
contents are written to hard disk on exit) that is designed to cope
with unreachable or down dns servers (for example in dial-in
networking).

original port by dlg@@ and robert@@, banged into shape by me.
not hooked to the builds as this needs further testing/tweaking
