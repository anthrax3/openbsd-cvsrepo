@roll sqlite3 into the main PowerDNS package, remove sqlite2 support, from Brad.

@The PowerDNS daemon is a versatile nameserver which supports
a large number of backends. These backends can either be plain
zonefiles or be more dynamic in nature. Additionally, through
use of clever programming techniques, PowerDNS offers very high
domain resolution performance.

This package contains the SQLite backend.

pdnsd is a proxy dns server with permanent caching (the cache
contents are written to hard disk on exit) that is designed to cope
with unreachable or down dns servers (for example in dial-in
networking).

pdnsd is configurable via a file and supports run-time configuration
using the program pdnsd-ctl that comes with pdnsd.

original port by dlg@@ and robert@@, banged into shape by me.
not hooked to the builds as this needs further testing/tweaking
