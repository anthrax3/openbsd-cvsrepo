1.1
log
@- update to 2.9.22, enable ldap.

- unbreak modules; when any module was enabled pdns_server was failing
to start up(!). Brad traced this to a LINK_SPEC problem and came up
with the workaround in patch-configure_in, thanks very much!

- set SHARED_ONLY and merge PFRAG.shared into PLISTs; PowerDNS itself
can work static-only, but you need to compile-in the relevant modules,
which doesn't mix well with MULTI_PACKAGES.

mysql backend is tested; other backends not yet, but this is a big
improvement on what's there at the moment.

text
@The PowerDNS daemon is a versatile nameserver which supports
a large number of backends. These backends can either be plain
zonefiles or be more dynamic in nature. Additionally, through
use of clever programming techniques, PowerDNS offers very high
domain resolution performance.

This package contains the LDAP backend.
