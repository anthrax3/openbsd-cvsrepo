https://doc.powerdns.com/md/authoritative/upgrading/ for upgrading
instructions.
testing by me and weerd@@

@The PowerDNS daemon is a versatile nameserver which supports a large number
of backends. These backends can either be plain zonefiles or be more dynamic
in nature. Additionally, through use of clever programming techniques,
PowerDNS offers very high domain resolution performance.

Backends for SQLite databases, BIND files and geographical load-balancing
are including in the main package. MySQL, PostgreSQL and LDAP back-ends are
packaged separately.

Prime examples of backends include relational databases,
but also (geographical) loadbalancing and failover algorithms.

pdnsd is a proxy dns server with permanent caching (the cache
contents are written to hard disk on exit) that is designed to cope
with unreachable or down dns servers (for example in dial-in
networking).

pdnsd is configurable via a file and supports run-time configuration
using the program pdnsd-ctl that comes with pdnsd.

Wonder why you should use it instead of BIND?

* permanent disk cache (useful for frequent power-offs/reboots)
* usually smaller memory footprint (depends on cache size)
* offline-detection prevents hangs (e.g. the typical hang on startup
  of some Netscape Navigator versions if not dialed in)
* better control about timeouts (also to prevent hangs)
* better control over the cache
* better run-time control
* strict RFC 2181 matching
* negative caching

original port by dlg@@ and robert@@, banged into shape by me.
not hooked to the builds as this needs further testing/tweaking
