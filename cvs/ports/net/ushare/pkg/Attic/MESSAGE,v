@USHARE_IFACE (listening interface) and USHARE_DIR (shared directories)
need to be set in ${SYSCONFDIR}/ushare.conf before starting ushare.

UPnP multicast discovery on the listening interface needs to be enabled.
Add this line to the matching hostname.if(5) and restart the network
(a.b.c.d being the interface IP address).

uShare is a UPnP (TM) A/V & DLNA Media Server. It implements the server
component that provides UPnP media devices with information on available
multimedia files. uShare uses the built-in http server of libupnp to
stream the files to clients.

GeeXboX uShare is able to provide access to both images, videos, music
or playlists files (see below for a complete file format support list
It does not act as an UPnP Media Adaptor and thus, can't transcode
streams to fit the client requirements.

Note that DLNA support is not enabled on OpenBSD.
