@update and subpackage GeoIP's geolite databases and add some new ones (city and asn)
@
text
@GeoIP includes a C library and command-line tools to look up information in
MaxMind's IP geolocation databases.

The distributed package includes a snapshot of the free GeoLite country-level
databases under CC BY-SA 3.0 license, "This product includes GeoLite data
created by MaxMind, available from http://www.maxmind.com."

Free-of-charge city and AS number databases and updated country databases are
available from http://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/legacy/geolite/, commercial
databases and automatic update services from http://www.maxmind.com/.

@Update to GeoIP 1.6.0, and bundle an up-to-date geolite database
(along with a maintainer Makefile target to ease updates).
Handled properly with @@sample to allow user updates.

Note that upstream no longer bundles the geoipupdate tool in the main
GeoIP software distribution (thus making this package LGPL only rather
than having any GPL components). geoipupdate could be provided as a
separate port if there's interest (it's only useful for paid subs
though).

GeoIP is a C library that enables the user to find the country that any IP
address or hostname originates from. It uses a file based database that is
accurate as of October 2004. This database simply contains IP blocks as keys,
and countries as values. This database should be more complete and accurate
than using reverse DNS lookups. Commercial databases and automatic update
services are available from http://www.maxmind.com/. Updated free databases
are available from http://geolite.maxmind.com/download/geoip/database/.

This module can be used to automatically select the geographically closest
mirror, to analyze your web server logs to determine the countries of your
visitors, for credit card fraud detection, and for software export controls.
