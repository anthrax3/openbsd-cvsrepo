1.3
log
@Update nmap to 6.40, and build with their bundled libpcap for now, bpf_timeval
patches are questionable and there's a timing-related problem to track down.
From giovanni@@ (maintainer) a while ago. Add a fix from jca@@ to fix a floating-
point related assertion failure seen on i386, reminded by zhuk@@. Committing the
update rather than the minimal assertion-fix diff as it has been more
extensively tested in the past (then slipped through the cracks), jasper@@
agrees. OK jasper@@ giovanni@@
