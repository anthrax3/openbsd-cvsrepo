@- update to 4.53 from Giovanni Bechis (MAINTAINER)
- re-work port from FLAVORS to MULTI_PACKAGES (-main, -zenmap)

lots of feedback and help from kili@@, merdely@@ and Giovanni

@Nmap is a utility for port scanning large networks, although it works
fine for single hosts.  The guiding philosophy for the creation of nmap
was TMTOWTDI (There's More Than One Way To Do It).  This is the Perl
slogan, but it is equally applicable to scanners.  Sometimes you need
speed, other times you may need stealth.  In some cases, bypassing
firewalls may be required.  Not to mention the fact that you may want to
scan different protocols (UDP, TCP, ICMP, etc.).  You just can't do all
this with one scanning mode.  And you don't want to have 10 different
scanners around, all with different interfaces and capabilities.  Thus I
incorporated virtually every scanning technique I know into nmap.
Specifically, nmap supports:

     Vanilla TCP connect() scanning, 
     TCP SYN (half open) scanning, 
     TCP FIN, Xmas, or NULL (stealth) scanning, 
     TCP ftp proxy (bounce attack) scanning,
     SYN/FIN scanning using IP fragments (bypasses packet filters), 
     UDP raw ICMP port unreachable scanning, 
     ICMP scanning (ping-sweep),
     TCP Ping scanning,
     Remote OS Identification by TCP/IP Fingerprinting, and 
     Reverse-ident scanning. 

Nmap also supports a number of performance and reliability features such
as dynamic delay time calculations, packet timeout and retransmission,
parallel port scanning, detection of down hosts via parallel pings.
Nmap also offers flexible target and port specification, decoy scanning,
determination of TCP sequence predictability characteristics, and output
to machine parseable or human readable log files.
