@Zonemaster is a software package to check the quality of DNS
delegations.
It checks the delegation from the parent nameservers including glue
records if necessary, consistency of all authoritative nameservers
and DNSSEC chains, among other things.
It can also check undelegated domains by providing the list of
authoritative nameservers and DS records.
This is a joint project from .SE and AFNIC implementing a major
rewrite of their erlier DNS validation projects DNSCheck and
Zonecheck.

This package contains the command-line user interface.
