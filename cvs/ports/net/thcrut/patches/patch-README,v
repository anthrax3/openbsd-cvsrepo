-[0x01] What is THC-RUT:
-    RUT (pronouced as 'root') mean 'aRe yoU There'.
-    It was developed to brute force its way into
-    wvlan (IEEE 802.11b) access points which use 
-    mac authentification.
-    It offers a wide range of _local_ network discovery
-    features like arp lookup on all hosts on a network
-    with vendor-string, spoofed DHCP request, RARP, BOOTP,
-    ICMP-ping and address mask request and some other features.
-
-This tool should be 'your first knife' on a foreign network.
-
-[0x02] How to compile:
-
-    # ./configure --help
-    # ./configure
-    # make
-    optional
-    # make install
-
-    that's it.
-
-    THC-RUT is known to compile on:
-    - Linux 2.2.17 #19 SMP i686 unknown
-    - Linux 2.4.3 #3 i686 unknown
-    - SunOS 5.8 Generic_108528-05 sun4u sparc
-    - NetBSD 1.5 (GENERIC) #1: Sun Nov 19 21:42:11 MET 2000 GENERIC i386
-    - OpenBSD 2.8 GENERIC#399 i386
-    - FreeBSD 4.2-RELEASE #0: Mon Nov 20 13:02:55 GMT 2000 GENERIC i386
-    - HP-UX 11.00 A 9000/715 unknown
-
-[0x03] Examples:
-
-    - 192.168.66.66 is an unused ip on the network
-      [try 255.255.255.255 or 0.0.0.0 for fun. Solaris loves it!]
-    - sourceIP is 0.0.0.0 by default
-    - source mac is 00:00:02:00:00:01 by default (lucent wvlan).
-    - destination mac is always ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff.
-      (Keep in mind: A few OSes [e.g. win2k] refuse to answer on ICMP packets
-      with unicast-dst-ip but broadcast-dst-mac. Use arp-whohas first).
-
-    ARP-request the local network (-m):
-    ./thc-rut -s 192.168.66.66 -m 192.168.0.1-192.168.255.254
-    [some hosts do not answer on arp request from src ip 0.0.0.0, use -s]
-
-    DHCP-request (-d):
-    ./thc-rut -d 255.255.255.255 (use ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:255.255.255.255
-    on networks with portsecurity enabled switches).
-
-    ICMP-mask request (-a):
-    ./thc-rut -s 192.168.66.66 -a 192.168.1.2
-
-    ICMP-ping each /24 host with different source-mac-adresses (-p):
-    ./thc-rut -s 192.168.66.66 -p \\ 
-                00:00:02:00:00:01-00:00:02:00:ff:ff:192.168.0.1-192.168.0.255
-    (this takes some time...)
-
-    DHCP-request with different source-mac-adresses and 50 packets /second (-d):
-    ./thc-rut -l 50 -d 00:00:02:00:00:01-00:00:02:00:ff:ff:255.255.255.255
