Configuring honeyd for use on OpenBSD
-------------------------------------

Honeyd requires an arp daemon to (falsely) answer arp queries. rarpd(8)
in base or arpd from ports can both be used for this. See honeyd(8) for
more detailed information on setting up honeyd.

To launch honeyd as a daemon, you can use the following command:
honeyd -u 546 -g 546 -f ${SYSCONFDIR}/honeyd.conf

The location to the honeyd configuration file must be specified via the
-f switch.  Also, honeyd requires an arp daemon to (falsely) answer arp
queries.  rarpd(8) in base or arpd from ports can both be used for this.
See honeyd(8) for more detailed information on setting up honeyd.

@import of honeyd-0.6:

Honeyd is a small daemon that creates virtual hosts on a network.  The
hosts can be configured to run arbitrary services, and their personality
can be adapted so that they appear to be running certain operating
systems.  Honeyd enables a single host to claim multiple addresses on a
LAN for network simulation.
