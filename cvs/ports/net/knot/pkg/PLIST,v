@Major update to knot-2.4.2

Upstream stopped supporting LTS 1.6.* releases.  Let's move to the 2.x
branch which only supports LMDB (patched to use MDB_WRITEMAP) and
uses __thread (thus, needs clang or lang/gcc).

The config format changed a bit, /usr/local/libexec/knot1to2 might help.

Most work done by Alexis Vachette, ok fcambus@@

@More fixes before import.

- --without-stuff -> --disable-stuff where needed
- replace /var and /etc with LOCALSTATEDIR and SYSCONFDIR
- add "OpenBSD" cvs tag to knot.rc

The two latter nits were pointed out by portcheck(1).
