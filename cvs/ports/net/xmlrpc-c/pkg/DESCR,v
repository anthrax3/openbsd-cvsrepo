@XML-RPC is a quick-and-easy way to make procedure calls over the
Internet. It converts the procedure call into XML document, sends
it to a remote server using HTTP, and gets back the response as
XML.   Due to the complexity of XML, this invariably leads to buggy
code. XML-RPC should never be used without total trust on both sides
of the connection. XML-RPC should never be used on non-authentified
channels.

This library provides a modular implementation of XML-RPC for
C and C++.  XML-RPC For C and C++ is designed for Unix and is most
tested on unix. The authors of the software thinks it works on any
standard unix, but the code is rather sloppy and needs quite a few
patches to run correctly on OpenBSD. Do not trust it for anything
important.

This package mostly exist to facilitate running code that 
occasionally wants xmlrpc, such as cmake.

@xmlrpc C/C++ library, prereq for newer cmake.
Also, makes sense to take this code out, as some other stuff is bound
to want this at some point.

This library is incredibly sloppy engineering. Reasonably readable
code, looks sensible, but incredible lack of testing (doesn't even pass
its own testsuite on a stable release... and does a lot of things that
can't work outside of linux... makes you wonder who is actually using
this...)
