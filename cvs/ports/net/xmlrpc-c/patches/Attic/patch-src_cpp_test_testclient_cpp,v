@xmlrpc C/C++ library, prereq for newer cmake.
Also, makes sense to take this code out, as some other stuff is bound
to want this at some point.

This library is incredibly sloppy engineering. Reasonably readable
code, looks sensible, but incredible lack of testing (doesn't even pass
its own testsuite on a stable release... and does a lot of things that
can't work outside of linux... makes you wonder who is actually using
this...)
