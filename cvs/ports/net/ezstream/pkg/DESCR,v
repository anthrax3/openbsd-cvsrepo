@- Update to latest release w/ many bugfixes and a few more features.
- Remove USE_GROFF, ezstream has mandoc manuals written on OpenBSD.
- Drop official port maintainership. Upstream, this is still maintained
  by me. Btw, being both upstream and port maintainer is bad ...

@Ezstream is a command line source client for Icecast media streaming servers.

In its basic mode of operation, it streams media files or data from standard
input without reencoding and thus requires only very little CPU resources. It
can also use various external decoders and encoders to reencode from one
format to another, and stream the result to an Icecast server. Additional
features include scriptable playlist and metadata handling. All of its
features make ezstream a very flexible source client.

Supported media formats for streaming are MP3, Ogg Vorbis and Ogg Theora.
Metadata is supported through TagLib, which can read information from many
media file formats.

Ezstream is a command line utility which allows streaming media files to
an Icecast server. By default, ezstream does not do any reencoding by
itself and thus requires very little CPU. Through the use of external
en- and decoders, virtually any format can be streamed.

Ezstream can also read from stdin. ID3v1 tags are supported in MP3 files
and all Ogg Vorbis tags are propagated as metadata as well.
