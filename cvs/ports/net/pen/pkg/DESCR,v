@Allows several servers to appear as one to the outside and automatically
detects servers that are down and distributes clients among the
available servers. This gives high availability and scalable
performance.

The load balancing algorithm keeps track of clients and will try to send
them back to the server they visited the last time. The client table has
a number of slots (2048 by default). When the table is full, the least
recently used one will be thrown out to make room for the new one. When
pen detects that a server is unavailable, it scans for another starting
with the server after the most recently used one. That way we get load
balancing and "fair" failover for free.

A side-effect of the load-balancing is that several logfiles are
produced, and all accesses seem to come from the load balancer. The
program mergelogs solves this problem by merging pen's log file with the
ones produced by the web servers.
