@update Smokeping to 2.6.8 and add an rc.d script

- note that the script file location has changed, it's probably simplest
to use the new sample httpd config.

@SmokePing is a latency logging and interactive graphing system, for
ICMP pings and many other protocols (DNS, SSH, SIP, HTTP and more).
The main daemon process organizes latency measurements, records them
in an RRDtool database, and optionally sends email alerts based on
various criteria. The CGI/FastCGI program presents the graphs and
optionally allows remote control via a master/slave protocol (allowing
aggregation of data from multiple test locations in a single server).

SmokePing is a latency logging and graphing system. It consists of a
daemon process which organizes the latency measurements and a CGI which
presents the graphs.

 * quite fast because it uses FPing todo the actual pinging

 * easy to customize through a webtemplate and an extensive
   configuration file.

 * written in perl and should readily port to any unix system

 * extensible through plug-in modules

 * an RRDtool frontend

 * able to deal with DYNAMIC IP addresses as used with Cable
   and ADSL internet.
