@Move samba4 to samba, and tweak the ports tree to use it.

ok ajacoutot@@

Upcoming commits will add additional tweaks.

Many thanks to Vadim Zhukov (who did most of the work), Ian McWilliam
(co-maintainer), Stuart Henderson who provided lots of support and
feedback, Antoine Jacoutot who patiently dealt with my broken diffs,
and more generally all the people involved.  Most of the recent work was
done during p2k15 and c2k15.
