1.2
log
@Update to Samba 3.0.30; bug fixes and a security issue fixed,
CVE-2008-1105.

Specifically crafted SMB responses can result in a heap overflow
in the Samba client code. Because the server process, smbd, can
itself act as a client during operations such as printer
notification and domain authentication, this issue affects both
Samba client and server installations.
