@update Samba to 3.5.2, most of the work done by Ian McWilliam

Note that the default passdb backend has been changed to 'tdbsam'.
See /usr/local/share/doc/samba/README.OpenBSD (or files/README.OpenBSD)
for more information and instructions for people who wish to convert an
existing smbpasswd-based installation.

@Update to Samba 3.0.30; bug fixes and a security issue fixed,
CVE-2008-1105.

Specifically crafted SMB responses can result in a heap overflow
in the Samba client code. Because the server process, smbd, can
itself act as a client during operations such as printer
notification and domain authentication, this issue affects both
Samba client and server installations.

1.1
log
@Update Samba to version 3.0.28 and add two patches from FreeBSD to allow
for non FFS filesystems (e.g. CD-ROMs) to be shared with Samba again.

This fixes CVE-2007-6015 and several other security problems.
