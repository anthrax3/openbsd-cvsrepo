@Move samba4 to samba, and tweak the ports tree to use it.

ok ajacoutot@@

Upcoming commits will add additional tweaks.

Many thanks to Vadim Zhukov (who did most of the work), Ian McWilliam
(co-maintainer), Stuart Henderson who provided lots of support and
feedback, Antoine Jacoutot who patiently dealt with my broken diffs,
and more generally all the people involved.  Most of the recent work was
done during p2k15 and c2k15.

@ldb is a LDAP-like embedded database. It is not at all LDAP standards
compliant, so if you want a standards compliant database then please
see the openldap package.

What ldb does is provide a fast database with an LDAP-like API
designed to be used within an application. In some ways it can be seen
as a intermediate solution between key-value pair databases and a real
LDAP database.

ldb is the database engine used in Samba4.
