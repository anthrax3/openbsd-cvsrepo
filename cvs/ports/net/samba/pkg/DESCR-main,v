@Move samba4 to samba, and tweak the ports tree to use it.

ok ajacoutot@@

Upcoming commits will add additional tweaks.

Many thanks to Vadim Zhukov (who did most of the work), Ian McWilliam
(co-maintainer), Stuart Henderson who provided lots of support and
feedback, Antoine Jacoutot who patiently dealt with my broken diffs,
and more generally all the people involved.  Most of the recent work was
done during p2k15 and c2k15.

Windows file- and printer-sharing protocols (SMB/CIFS).

Samba allows Windows clients to use filesystem space and printers of
your OpenBSD system as if they were local drives or printers.

While configuration for larger sites can be quite complex, the default
installation of this package allows for immediate use of your OpenBSD
machine as a server for Windows clients.

Available flavors:

ldap	Enable LDAP support

Available subpackage:

docs	Documentation in HTML and PDF (man pages are part of the base package)
