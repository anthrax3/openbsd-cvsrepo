@The Samba suite is a set of programs that implement a server for the
Windows file- and printer-sharing protocols (SMB/CIFS).

Samba allows Windows clients to use filesystem space and printers of
your OpenBSD system as if they were local drives or printers.

While configuration for larger sites can be quite complex, the default
installation of this package allows for immediate use of your OpenBSD
machine as a server for Windows clients.

Available flavors:

cups	Enable CUPS support
ldap	Enable LDAP support

Available subpackage:

docs	Documentation in HTML and PDF (man pages are part of the base package)

The Samba suite is a set of programs which run under most UNIX and
UNIX-like operating systems. These programs deliver most of the important
functionality of a Microsoft Lan Manager server. That is, they support
remote access to UNIX filespace and UNIX printers from Lan Manager
compatible clients. In practical terms, this means that such clients
can connect to and use UNIX filespace as if it was a local disk drive,
or UNIX printers as if they were local printers.

Some of the most popular Lan Manager compatible clients include Lan
Manager itself, Windows for Workgroups, OS/2 and Windows NT.
