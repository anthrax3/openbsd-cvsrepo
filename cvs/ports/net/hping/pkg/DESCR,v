@Update to hping3

- drop privs to a dedicated user
- in case of error, print a message regarding pf blocking pf blocking
  outgoing packets
- do not activate Tcl support (for now?)

@hping is a command-line oriented TCP/IP packet assembler/analyzer. The
interface is inspired by the ping(8) unix command, but hping isn't just
for sending ICMP echo requests. It supports TCP, UDP, ICMP and RAW-IP
protocols, has a traceroute mode, the ability to send files in a covert
channel, and many other features. While hping was mainly used as a
security tool in the past, it can be used in many ways by people that
don't care about security to test networks and hosts. A subset of the
stuff you can do using hping:

- Firewall testing Advanced port scanning
- Network testing, using different protocols, TOS, fragmentation
- Manual path MTU discovery
- Advanced traceroute, under all the supported protocols
- Remote OS fingerprinting
- Remote uptime guessing
- TCP/IP stacks auditing

N.B. the message "[send_ip] sendto: No route to host" often indicates
that sending a packet has been blocked by PF on the local machine.

@hping was b0rked -- interfaced weren't actually recognized.  This updates
hping to 2.0.0rc1 (which fixes that problem), and also cleans up the port
a bit.

Hping is a software to do TCP/IP stack auditing, to uncover firewall
policy, to scan TCP port in a lot of different modes, to transfer
files accross a firewall and many other stuff. Using hping you are
able to do a lot of not security-regarding stuff. For example you
can test networks performance, check if a host is up, check if TOS
is handled et cetera.
