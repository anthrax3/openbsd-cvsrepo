@- remove obsolete micq, as prompted by jiri b. on ports@@
it's been superseded by climm, but nobody even said there were using it anymore.
alternatives would be irssi/bitlbee or pidgin,-finch

@mICQ is a very portable text-mode ICQ clone - it is known to compile
under Linux, BSD, AIX, HPUX, Windows, AmigaOS and with restrictions
BeOS. Originally written by Matthew D. Smith, a great part of mICQ has
been rewritten by Ruediger Kuhlmann, in particular the support for the
new version 8 of the ICQ protocol that became necessary, the
internationalization, the file transfer and some restructuring of the
code.

A text-based implementation of ICQ, independant of Mirabilis.
Currently does not offer chat.  Still appears rough:  There's no
command-line editing, and ANSI color codes are hardcoded in the
program.
