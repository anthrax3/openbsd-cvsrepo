@- remove a patch to zap contents of a file which is already not being
built due to a Makefile patch. From Brad, ok stsp@@ (maintainer).

- don't use a header which is only needed because of the unused file,
from/commit req'd by stsp@@.

shouldn't affect the package, but bumped for safety.

-Design discussion.
-
-The primary task of this module is to add a host route to the PPTP
-server so that the kernel continues to deliver PPTP control and data
-connection packets to the server despite the new PPP interface that is
-created.  The flag --no-host-route is to disable this (not yet implemented).
-
-A secondary task may be to implement all-to-tunnel routing if the
-appropriate flag is specified on the command line.  The flag
---route-all is to implement this (not yet implemented).
-
-Caveat.
-
-It is not possible from the "ip route" command to determine if a host
-route already exists, so it isn't practical to put the routing table
-back exactly as it was.
-
-We have a choice of either leaving our route lying around, or
-destroying a route that the user had pre-arranged.  Both are
-unfortunate.  The flag --remove-host-route is to remove the route
-regardless (not yet implemented).

log
@Fix build with gcc-2.95 (tested on sparc, simh-vax was too slow).

Remove some useless linux-specific code which tried to modify
the routing table by running "/bin/ip". Because this code has
no error checking and failed silently, no one noticed it.
Noticed it now because it didn't compile with gcc-2.95.

Don't install useless documentation.
Install useful notes on protocol insecurity instead.

Tweak the man page a little. Dunno if anyone is still using
Bezeq ADSL modems that need the --quirks option, but move
the information here just in case.

Clean up MESSAGE; don't shout at everybody about security holes
in a particular kind of modem that's almost 10 years old.
