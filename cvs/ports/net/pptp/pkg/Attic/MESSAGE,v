@Remove SECURITY files. They have served their purpose in the past but
have become pretty useless nowadays (and the pkg tools do not display

@Fix build with gcc-2.95 (tested on sparc, simh-vax was too slow).

Remove some useless linux-specific code which tried to modify
the routing table by running "/bin/ip". Because this code has
no error checking and failed silently, no one noticed it.
Noticed it now because it didn't compile with gcc-2.95.

Don't install useless documentation.
Install useful notes on protocol insecurity instead.

Tweak the man page a little. Dunno if anyone is still using
Bezeq ADSL modems that need the --quirks option, but move
the information here just in case.

Clean up MESSAGE; don't shout at everybody about security holes
in a particular kind of modem that's almost 10 years old.

You will need to allow gre traffic for pptp to work:
	sysctl net.inet.gre.allow=1
pptp will automatically try to set this sysctl before opening a gre socket.

See http://www.schneier.com/pptp-faq.html for a list of security flaws.
==========================================================================
ATTENTION:
Alcatel ADSL modems contain default logins with easily computed passwords.
See http://security.sdsc.edu/self-help/alcatel/ for more information.
==========================================================================
You may want to use TCP/IP packet filter rules to prevent unauthorized 
access to your modem (from internal net or spoofed/bounced TCP/IP packets).

@Update to version 1.7.1, from new maintainer Stefan Sperling.
He also fixed wrong facts in the port's man page, updated MESSAGE accordingly,
removed an obsolete script, and improved the example configuration.

Thanks go to former maintainer Benoit LECOCQ, for having cared about the
port the time before.

A reconnect-script has been installed as ${PREFIX}/sbin/pptp-reconnect,
edit it to reflect your environment.

Next, setup /etc/ppp/{options,chap-secrets,pap-secrets} with

You can enable or disable GRE with sysctl -w net.inet.gre.allow=1.
It needs to be enabled for some situations.
