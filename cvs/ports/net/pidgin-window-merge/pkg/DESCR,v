@Window Merge is a Pidgin plugin that merges a conversation window with the Buddy
List window. It can be used to achieve a rudimentary "single window mode" for
Pidgin. Both Window Merge and Pidgin itself should be kept updated for the most
stable experience.

This project was not written and is not maintained by Pidgin developers. The
nature of this project can potentially destabilize Pidgin or its other plugins,
so use it at your own risk.
