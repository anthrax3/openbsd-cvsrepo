@- swap order of ioctls so SIOCSIFADDR comes before SIOCSIFNETMASK
- remove unneeded MESSAGE
- don't use tbl to format manpages, it's no longer needed
- mark as NOT_FOR_ARCHS=${LP64_ARCHS}, it's broken there
(uses wrong MAC address)

@You may need to add these entries to your /etc/services file 
to register the dhcp services:

dhcps	67/udp    # dhcp server
dhcpc	68/udp	  # dhcp client

Also, ensure that BPF support is compiled into the kernel.

Examples and documentation are in:
 ${PREFIX}/share/doc/wide-dhcp , and
 ${PREFIX}/share/examples/wide-dhcp

@commit this three-month old patch that was posted to ports@@ with no
response.  Does anyone out there use this port at all?  It was broken,
this unbreaks it by FAKEing it, but there's noone using it to test
it out....
