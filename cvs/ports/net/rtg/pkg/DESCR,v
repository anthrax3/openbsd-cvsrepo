@RTG is a flexible, scalable, high-performance SNMP statistics
monitoring system. It is designed for enterprises and service
providers who need to collect time-series SNMP data from a large
number of targets quickly. All collected data is inserted into a
relational database that provides a common interface for applications
to generate complex queries and reports. RTG includes utilities
that generate configuration and target files, traffic reports, 95th
percentile reports and graphical data plots. These utilities may
be used to produce a web-based interface to the data.

    * Runs as a daemon, incurring no cron or kernel startup overhead
    * Written entirely in C for speed, incurring no interpreter overhead
    * Multi-threaded for asynchronous polling and database insertion
    * Inserts data into a relational database where complex queries
      and reports may be generated
    * Performs no data averaging in order to support billing, etc.
    * Can poll at sub-one-minute intervals
