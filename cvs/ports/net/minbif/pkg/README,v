| Running ${FULLPKGNAME} on OpenBSD

First, edit ${SYSCONFDIR}/minbif/minbif.conf to suit your needs.
Then, either start it in daemon fork mode (will fork for every client)
using the provided rc.d(8) script, or start it through inetd, adding a
line like the following to /etc/inetd.conf:

127.0.0.1:6667    stream  tcp     nowait _minbif ${TRUEPREFIX}/bin/minbif minbif ${SYSCONFDIR}/minbif/minbif.conf

inetd(8) must be reloaded (or started). To enable it at boot, the
following line needs to be added to rc.conf.local(8):
inetd_flags=

log
@Update to minbif 1.0.5.

- Remove now useless patches
- Add an rc script for daemon mode
- move MESSAGE to README
- set @@mode 750 for minbif's datadir

Seems to work fine against a pair of xmpp servers here.
