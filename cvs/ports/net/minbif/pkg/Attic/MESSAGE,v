@Update to minbif 1.0.5.

- Remove now useless patches
- Add an rc script for daemon mode
- move MESSAGE to README
- set @@mode 750 for minbif's datadir

Seems to work fine against a pair of xmpp servers here.

@First, edit ${SYSCONFDIR}/minbif/minbif.conf to suit your needs.
Then, either start it in daemon fork mode (will fork for every client):

	sudo -u _minbif ${TRUEPREFIX}/bin/minbif

Or start it through inetd, adding a line like the following to
/etc/inetd.conf:

127.0.0.1:6667    stream  tcp     nowait _minbif ${TRUEPREFIX}/bin/minbif minbif ${SYSCONFDIR}/minbif/minbif.conf

inetd(8) must be reloaded (or started). To enable it at boot, the
following line needs to be added to rc.conf.local(5):
inetd_flags=

@Tweak MESSAGEs/READMEs now that inetd(8) is off by default.

@Import minbif 1.0.3:
Minbif aims to use the libpurple library from the Pidgin project to
provide an IRC-friendly instant messaging client. It also maps
everything to pure IRC commands, giving it an intuitive, natural
feeling. Joining a conversation is a simple /join, banning an user is a
real IRC ban, sending files by a simple DCC, etc.

Comment out the full-bloat-video-audio flavor atm, until someone tests it..
with feedback and ok jasper@@
