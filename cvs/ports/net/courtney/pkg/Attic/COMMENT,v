1.1.1.1
log
@Monitors the network and identifies the source machines of SATAN
probes/attacks. Courtney receives input from tcpdump counting the
number of new services a machine originates within a certain time
window. If one machine connects to numerous services within that
time window, courtney identifies that machine as a potential SATAN
host.
