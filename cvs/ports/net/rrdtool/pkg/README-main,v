Use within a chroot jail
========================

Under OpenBSD, the default web server runs chrooted under /var/www.
To use the rrdtool(1) binary from within this chroot (for example, as
needed by some CGI/PHP scripts), rrdtool itself and several libraries
and configuration files must be copied in. The follow command has
been provided to do this for you:

    # ${TRUEPREFIX}/share/examples/rrdtool/rrdtool-chroot enable

Note that you will have to run this command again when the rrdtool
package is updated.

@Update to rrdtool 1.4.8. Merge p5-RRD into the main package.

Note that this now uses cairo for graphics generation and pango/fontconfig
for text rendering; if you are using this in a chroot jail (for cgi/php
scripts, etc) you will need to take additional steps to install the relevant
files. A script is provided to copy the relevant libraries and support files;
see /usr/local/share/doc/pkg-readmes/rrdtool-1.4.8 for more details.
