1.1
log
@Update to rrdtool 1.4.8. Merge p5-RRD into the main package.

Note that this now uses cairo for graphics generation and pango/fontconfig
for text rendering; if you are using this in a chroot jail (for cgi/php
scripts, etc) you will need to take additional steps to install the relevant
files. A script is provided to copy the relevant libraries and support files;
see /usr/local/share/doc/pkg-readmes/rrdtool-1.4.8 for more details.

text
@RRDtool is a high performance data logging and graphing system for time
series data (i.e. network bandwidth, machine-room temperature, server
load average, etc). RRDtool can be easily integrated in shell scripts,
perl, python, ruby, lua or tcl applications. It stores the data in a
very compact way that will not expand over time, and it presents useful
graphs by processing the data to enforce a certain data density.

This package includes the standalone rrdupdate/rrdinfo/rrdcreate tools,
which are packaged separately for those only needing to update RRDs
(but not draw graphs) without pulling in a big dependency chain.
