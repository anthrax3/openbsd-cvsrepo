@The Net::Inspect module allows to inspect data on various network
layers.

The idea of Net::Inspect is to plug various layers of network
inspection together to analyze data.  This is kind of what wireshark
or IDS do, exept this is in perl and therefore slower to execute
but faster to develop and maybe more flexibel too.
