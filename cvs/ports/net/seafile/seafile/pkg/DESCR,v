@Seafile is a next-generation open source cloud storage system, with
advanced support for file syncing, privacy protection and teamwork.

Collections of files are called libraries, and each library can be
synced separately. A library can be encrypted with a user chosen
password. This password is not stored on the server, so even the server
admin can't view your file contents.

Seafile lets you create groups with file syncing, wiki, and discussion
- enabling easy collaboration around documents within a team.
