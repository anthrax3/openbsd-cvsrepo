| Running ${FULLPKGNAME} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Please note, it is common for scripts using this package to use the
softlimit application to restrict the datasize limit of tcpclient/tcpserver;
in some cases the suggested limits are too small for successful use with
OpenBSD and may cause process termination.
