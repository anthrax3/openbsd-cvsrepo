@maradns is a DNS server written with security, simplicity,
and performance in mind.

Features:
* Security-aware programming.
  A DNS server needs to be secure.
  There's a number of security features in the code, including:
         1. The code uses a special string library which is
            resistant to buffer overflows.
         2. The code, if started as root, mandates running as 
            an unprivileged user in a chroot() jail.
* Open-Source.
  This DNS server is BSD licensed code.
  There are no restrictions attached to this code.
* Simplicity.
  This DNS server has the minimum number of features needed
  to correctly act as an authoritative and/or recursive 
  name server.
