tcptrace is a TCP dump file analysis tool written by Shawn Ostermann
at Ohio University. It is NOT a packet capture program. It reads
output dump files in the formats of several popular packet capturing
programs: tcpdump, snoop, etherpeek, and netm

For each connection, it keeps track of elapsed time, bytes/segments
sent and received, retransmissions, round trip times, window
advertisements, throughput, etc.  Its output format ranges from
Simple to Long to Very Detailed.
