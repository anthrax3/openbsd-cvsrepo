@Remove netdude/libnetdude, as proposed on ports@@ about a week ago
with no objections. It relies on a GUI toolkit which hasn't been updated
in 10 years, needs to run as root in order to get tcpdump to parse
capture files, and even then it still doesn't work.

- OpenBSD does not have net/ethernet.h, use netinet/if_ether.h instead.

- The "read-write filtering (growing trace)" test should be checking the
  res_filters_3 variable for test results.

- Exit with exit code 1 if any tests fail.

@Make the test suite actually build and run:

- Set REGRESS_DEPENDS = ${FULLPKGPATH} because the test suite needs the
  libnetdude package itself to be installed in order to build and run.

- Make the "check" target in test/Makefile actually execute the test
  suite, instead of just building the test programs and exiting.

- Change the test suite program (test/lnd-test.c) to include
  netinet/if_ether.h instead of net/ethernet.h which does not exist on
  OpenBSD.

- Fix the last test to report the correct result.

- Let lnd-test exit with exit code 1 if any tests fail (previously it
  would always exit with exit code 0 even if tests fail).

The test suite still fails due to the failure of one test, but at least
it builds and runs now. :)
