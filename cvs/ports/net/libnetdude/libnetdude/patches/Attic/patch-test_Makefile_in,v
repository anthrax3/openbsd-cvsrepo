@Remove netdude/libnetdude, as proposed on ports@@ about a week ago
with no objections. It relies on a GUI toolkit which hasn't been updated
in 10 years, needs to run as root in order to get tcpdump to parse
capture files, and even then it still doesn't work.

Actually run the test suite when "make check" is executed.

@Make the test suite actually build and run:

- Set REGRESS_DEPENDS = ${FULLPKGPATH} because the test suite needs the
  libnetdude package itself to be installed in order to build and run.

- Make the "check" target in test/Makefile actually execute the test
  suite, instead of just building the test programs and exiting.

- Change the test suite program (test/lnd-test.c) to include
  netinet/if_ether.h instead of net/ethernet.h which does not exist on
  OpenBSD.

- Fix the last test to report the correct result.

- Let lnd-test exit with exit code 1 if any tests fail (previously it
  would always exit with exit code 0 even if tests fail).

The test suite still fails due to the failure of one test, but at least
it builds and runs now. :)
