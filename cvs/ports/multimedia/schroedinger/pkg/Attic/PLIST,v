@Drop multimedia/schroedinger.

It is broken with an issue with mutexes, long unmaintained upstream and such a
niche format that it's of no use as an encoder.

@Update to schroedinger-1.0.11.

- Added 10-bit and 16-bit support to both the encoder and decoder.
Only works in intra mode. Tested formats are 16-bit 4:4:4 and
10-bit 4:2:2.

Dependencies are still happy.

Schroedinger is a high-speed Dirac codec being developed by Fluendo
