@Update to libmms-0.6.2.

from Amit Kulkarni with tweaks from Brad
@
text
@LibMMS is common library for parsing mms:// and mmsh:// type network
streams. These are commonly used to stream Windows Media Video content
over the web. LibMMS itself is only for receiving MMS stream, it
doesn't handle sending at all. If you need streaming functionality,
look for other protocol, such as RT(S)P. MMS is legacy thing, being
closed with no specs and abandoned even by its creator, the Microsoft
Corp.
