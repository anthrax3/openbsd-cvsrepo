@Revert upstream commit 457492e97dd1435021cff15d4fbb8f1fd7be9b24, it breaks
due to changing "-I/usr/local/include/kde4" to
"-isystem /usr/local/include/kde4". Still investigating, who to blame:
CMake, Phonon or maybe someone else... not me, right?

(note for myself: there is no such thing as extra build for KDE stuff)

Breakage noticed by naddy@@: thanks and sorry.
