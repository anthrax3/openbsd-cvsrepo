log
@Another meaningful update from KDE land: Phonon 4.7.2 and friends.
Main change is that VLC backend becames the default (and really performs
better than GStreamer one).

(now please get your children out of display)

Another change is that due the fact that Phonon now supports library
renaming upstream, libphononexperimental.so becomes
libphonon_sexperimental.so. This doesn't affect any ports imported as of now.

REVISION bumps for the dependant ports to follow.

@Update Phonon to 4.6.0. Major changes:
  * Main library renamed from "phonon" to "phonon_s", to avoid clashing
    with Qt4's one.
  * Backends now live in multimedia/phonon-backend port (committed earlier).
  * The multimedia/phonon module added, to avoid adding complicated
    RDEP strings to ports of Phonon users.
