1.3
log
@Switch Qt5-based Phonon to a separate port, with a separate version.

The phonon.port.mk stays where it is (at least until KDE4 dies).

This gives a chance for various KF5 things to build again.
@
text
@Phonon is the multimedia framework for KDE4.

Phonon uses backend plugins to access different providers, see
ports in multimedia/phonon-backend. At least one of the backend
plugins should be installed.

This is the Qt4-based version.
@


1.2
log
@Update Phonon to 4.6.0. Major changes:
  * Main library renamed from "phonon" to "phonon_s", to avoid clashing
    with Qt4's one.
  * Backends now live in multimedia/phonon-backend port (committed earlier).
  * The multimedia/phonon module added, to avoid adding complicated
    RDEP strings to ports of Phonon users.

phonon is the chosen multimedia backend for kde4.
A version of phonon ships with qt4. Unfortunately, it's not quite enough
for kde4, so there is a more recent version provided as an external package.

@integrated phonon (from qt4) is not enough for kde4.
to be linked to the build once I figure out the consequences.
