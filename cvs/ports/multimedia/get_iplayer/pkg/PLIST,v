@Switch to devel version of get_iplayer which has a minimal workaround to
reinstate --pid/--url downloading following removal of the old XML data
sources that it was using.

@- add the manpage back in (generated from the script itself, so a
couple of RUN_DEPENDS move to BUILD_DEPENDS).

- cherrypick a couple of diffs from git (notably, automatically add
the correct swfVfy url to rtmpdump; if you've set this manually in
/etc/get_iplayer/options you can remove it).

- improve COMMENT, update HOMEPAGE.

@update to 1.85; hulu and channel4 were removed, too much work keeping on

1.1.1.1
log
@import get_iplayer, port from David Cathcart with a few tweaks by myself:

This tool allows you to search, index and download/stream:

    * BBC iPlayer TV - H.264 / Quicktime / mov and Flash / AVI
    * BBC iPlayer Radio (Local and National) - 128+ kbps MP3 / AAC and 
       Realaudio
    * BBC Podcasts - 128 kb/s MP3 / AAC
    * BBC iPlayer TV subtitles - SubRip / srt
    * ITV player Catch-up or classic TV - WMV / ASF
    * Hulu.com* TV - MP4
    * Hulu.com* Closed-captions / subtitles - SubRip / srt

get_iplayer has PVR-like capabilities (like Sky+ / TiVo / Series-Link);
You can save lists of programme searches which are automatically
downloaded when they become available.
