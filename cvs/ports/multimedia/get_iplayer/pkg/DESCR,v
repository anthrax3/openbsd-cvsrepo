@This tool allows you to search, index and record/stream:

    * BBC iPlayer TV - up to 3200 kbps HD 720p H.264 / Quicktime / MP4
    * BBC Live TV - 500 kbps H.264 / MP4
    * BBC iPlayer Radio - up to 192 kbps MP3 / AAC and Realaudio
    * BBC Live Radio - up to 192 kbps MP3 / AAC, WMA and Realaudio
    * BBC Podcasts - up to 192 kbps MP3 / AAC
    * BBC iPlayer TV subtitles - SubRip / srt

Some content is only available to users connecting from UK addresses.

get_iplayer has PVR-like capabilities (like Sky+ / TiVo / Series-Link);
you can save lists of programme searches which are automatically
recorded when they become available so that you can watch them when
you choose and on devices that cannot run Adobe Flash Player - even
if you don't have adequate broadband speeds or if your broadband
streams too slowly at peak hours when you want to watch a programme.

which is not included.  bump PKGNAME.
