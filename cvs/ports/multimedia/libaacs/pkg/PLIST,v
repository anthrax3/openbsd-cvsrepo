@libaacs is a research project to implement the Advanced Access Content
System specification.

This research project provides, through an open-source library, a way to
understand how the AACS works.

This research project is mainly developed by an international team of
developers from Doom9.

NB: this project doesn't offer any key or certificate that could be used
to decode encrypted copyrighted material.

Reviewed and a few fixes by Brad
