@iplayer-dl used the BBC's iPhone streams to download programmes; however
BBC changed things in Dec 2010 to require a TLS connection with an Apple-
signed client certificate present in Apple iOS devices. As a result
iplayer-dl is no longer useful, so remove the port.

(get_iplayer is an alternative which uses the RTMP streams intended
for the Flash player instead).

@The BBC launched an iPhone-specific version of the streaming iPlayer
service in March 2008. As the iPhone does not support Flash video,
this variant of the service uses browser sniffing to serve h.264
(`MP4') video to clients.

By pretending to be an iPhone, it's possible to download the MP4
files for offline viewing. You can find out more about the history
of this, and of the BBC's repeated attempts to prevent this, on the
Beebhack Wiki, http://beebhack.wikia.com/wiki/IPhone_H.264_version.
