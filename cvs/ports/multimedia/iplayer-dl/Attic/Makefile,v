@iplayer-dl used the BBC's iPhone streams to download programmes; however
BBC changed things in Dec 2010 to require a TLS connection with an Apple-
signed client certificate present in Apple iOS devices. As a result
iplayer-dl is no longer useful, so remove the port.

(get_iplayer is an alternative which uses the RTMP streams intended
for the Flash player instead).

@REVISION bump all ruby ports due to a change in the pkgspec.
Previously, we were using ruby->=1.8,<=1.9, instead of
ruby->=1.8,<1.9.  While this wouldn't cause an issue, since
our ruby-1.9.2 package isn't included in ruby->=1.8,<=1.9,
it's still wrong and should be fixed.  This also fixes the
following minor issues:

Switch from using FLAVOR to MODRUBY_FLAVOR for *_DEPENDS.
Currently we don't have a ruby port that uses FLAVORs that
would differ from MODRUBY_FLAVOR, but it's possible we will
in the future.

Switch from BASE_PKGPATH to BUILD_PKGPATH in a few cases in
REGRESS_DEPENDS.  This probably is not strictly necessary, but
BUILD_PKGPATH is used in more cases, so it is good for
consistency.

Switch to new style *_DEPENDS, with the version specification
at the end.  The remaining cases where this is not done is
because a specific version is used.

Some FULLPKGNAME added to REGRESS_DEPENDS, to make sure that if
the old version is installed when you run a regress test, it
will install the new version first.

Some conversion of spaces to tabs for consistency.

OK landry@@

@import iplayer-dl, N.B. this is for UK-based users, others don't have
access to the service it uses.  ok bernd@@

The BBC launched an iPhone-specific version of the streaming iPlayer
service in March 2008. As the iPhone does not support Flash video,
this variant of the service uses browser sniffing to serve h.264
(`MP4') video to clients.

By pretending to be an iPhone, it's possible to download the MP4
files for offline viewing. You can find out more about the history
of this, and of the BBC's repeated attempts to prevent this, on the
Beebhack Wiki, http://beebhack.wikia.com/wiki/IPhone_H.264_version.
