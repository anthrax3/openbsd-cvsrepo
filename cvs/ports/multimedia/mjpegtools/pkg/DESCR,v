@The MJPEG-tools are a basic set of utilities for editing, playing back,
filtering and encoding video under UNIX-like operating systems.

Flavors:

  quicktime - Builds the package with support for reading and writing
              QuickTime ".MOV" files.

  optimized - Builds the package with SSE instructions. Packages built
              with this FLAVOR might not run on systems that are not SSE
	      capable.

The mjpegtools are a set of programs that can do recording, playback,
editing and eventual MPEG compression of audio and video under Linux.

a4 4
Although primarily intended for use with capture / playback boards
based on the Zoran ZR36067 MJPEG codec chip, the mjpegtools can easily
be used to process and compress MJPEG video streams captured using
xawtv using simple frame-buffer devices.

There are two FLAVORs for this port:
d10 3
a12 6
  optimized - This FLAVOR turns on processor specific compiler
    optimizations.  Without this FLAVOR, these optimizations are
    turned off.

  quicktime - This FLAVOR allows the mjpegtools to read and write
    Quicktime files.
