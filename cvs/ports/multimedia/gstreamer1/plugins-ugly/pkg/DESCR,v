@Update to gstreamer1-plugins-ugly-1.2.0.
@
text
@This is GStreamer, a framework for streaming media.
This package contains the "ugly" elements for gstreamer-${API}.

    "When you have to shoot, shoot.  Don't talk."

There are times when the world needs a color between black and white.
Quality code to match the good's, but two-timing, backstabbing and ready
to sell your freedom down the river.  These plug-ins might have a patent
noose around their neck, or a lock-up license, or any other problem that
makes you think twice about shipping them.
