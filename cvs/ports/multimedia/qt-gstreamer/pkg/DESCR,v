@QtGStreamer is a set of libraries providing C++ bindings for GStreamer

integrating GStreamer better in Qt applications. The goal of this
module is to allow easy use of GStreamer for applications targetting
MeeGo Mobile or the KDE desktop.

This will be used by KDE4 soon. Note that (sadly) the ported version uses
GStreamer 0.10 still because KDE4 Phonon GStreamer backend still relies on
it, too. Things would change at the next KDE major release, hopefully.
