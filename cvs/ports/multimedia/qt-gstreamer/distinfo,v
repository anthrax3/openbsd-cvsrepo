1.2
log
@Update qt-gstreamer to 1.2, effectively switching to GStreamer 1.x as well.

This could break build of graphics/digikam and x11/kde4/artikulate, this
will be addressed quiet soon.

1.1.1.1
log
@QtGStreamer is a set of libraries providing C++ bindings for GStreamer
with a Qt-style API, plus some helper classes and elements for
integrating GStreamer better in Qt applications. The goal of this
module is to allow easy use of GStreamer for applications targetting
MeeGo Mobile or the KDE desktop.

This will be used by KDE4 soon. Note that (sadly) the ported version uses
GStreamer 0.10 still because KDE4 Phonon GStreamer backend still relies on
it, too. Things would change at the next KDE major release, hopefully.
