@Argh, another 'cvs rm' that I missed; these files should be removed
with the update to xine-lib 1.1.17 (sndio support is now included
upstream). Reminded by Brad.

@update to Xine-lib 1.1.15

This release contains some security fixes, notably a DoS via
corrupted Ogg files (CVS-2008-3231), some related fixes, and
fixes for a few possible buffer overflows.

1.1
log
@- fix win32-codecs support.  libtool won't allow linking static libs
  (libi386.a) into shared objects, so we use the source file for
  i386_set_ldt() from libi386.
- no need for OSS audio support.
- use the right CFLAGS for pthread linkage.
