@Remove multimedia/moovida.

Even if i spent most of p2k9 working on it, the opensource version died
5+ years ago, and even the .NET successor disappeared from the
interwebs... those days, people should try to port XBMC/Kodi :)

@Import Moovida (formerly known as Elisa) 1.0.7 :

Moovida is an open source cross-platform media center solution designed
to be simple for people not particularly familiar with computers. With
Moovida you can enjoy:
- Watch your pictures with previews and nicely animated slideshows.
- Watch your movies and video clips as well as online ones.
- Manage your music collection by artists or albums covers.
- Moovida finds automatically medias on your network, from network
  drives, Windows Mediaplayer, using Coherence uPNP framework.

Work done entirely at p2k9, horray for Budapest!
