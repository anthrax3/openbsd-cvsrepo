@Remove multimedia/moovida.

Even if i spent most of p2k9 working on it, the opensource version died
5+ years ago, and even the .NET successor disappeared from the
interwebs... those days, people should try to port XBMC/Kodi :)

@To have a good user experience with Moovida media center, install
moovida-plugins-good, moovida-plugins-ugly and moovida-plugins-bad
packages.
Note that it heavily depends on GL effects, so you'll need harware
acceleration for Moovida to work fine.
If performance is poor, you can try setting vblank_mode=0 in
environment before launching it.
After a first launch to make it create its default configuration file
you have to edit ~/.moovida/moovida.conf to teach where to find your
media files.

@Teach users that they _have_ to give Moovida the paths to their media
files to properly work. It can't detect files all alone, and scanning
the entire filesystem would be stupid anyway.
