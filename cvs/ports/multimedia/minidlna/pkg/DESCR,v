@Add comment to minidlna config file suggesting use of uuid, based on part of
a diff from LEVAI Daniel.

Mention the name ReadyMedia in COMMENT/DESCR (the project name has changed
upstream; possibly this was done to avoid using the letters d l n and a in
the name; I have not changed PKGNAME at this time).
