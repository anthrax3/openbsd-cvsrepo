log
@Forgot to run update-patches, noticed by naddy@@.

Went unnoticed in "dpb x11/kde4142" build because gstreamer backend doesn't
get picked up by dependency, since it's not default backend now.

@Update Phonon to 4.8.1.

This also updates its backends, due to some API changes it's easier to this
in a single batch. The biggest news here are that phonon-gstreamer switches
to GStreamer 1.0, finally.

log
@Import Phonon backends, separated since Phonon 4.6.0.
Phonon update will follow shortly.

VLC backend has limited functionality, so default is GStreamer one.
