@LiVES is a Video Editing System. It is designed to be simple to use, yet
powerful. It is small in size, yet it has many advanced features.

LiVES mixes realtime video performance and non-linear editing in one
professional quality application. It will let you start editing and
making video right away, without having to worry about formats, frame
sizes, or framerates. It is a very flexible tool which is used by both
professional VJ's and video editors - mix and switch clips from the
keyboard, use dozens of realtime effects, trim and edit your clips in
the clip editor, and bring them together using the multitrack timeline.
You can even record your performance in real time, and then edit it
further or render it straight away.

For the more technically minded, the application is frame and sample
accurate, and it can be controlled remotely or scripted for use as a
video server. And it supports all of the latest free standards.
