@- Pull in some bits to deal with newer FFmpeg API. While testing I found
transcode was already broken as is due to it relying on certain functionality
with presets which is no longer relevant for more modern FFmpeg. Searching
via Google showed the same bug being reported with Debian, Gentoo and Arch.
They have eliminted the use of presets but that just exposed another bug.
So this builds with newer FFmpeg but it is essentially just as broken as
before. If anyone wants to take a look at this and figure out why it is
crashing go ahead.
- Merge the quicktime FLAVOR into the main port / package. IMO it doesn't
make sense to have an app like this that cannot work with the MP4 container

FFmpeg bits taken from FreeBSD and Debian packages.

@transcode is a text console video-stream processing tool. 
It supports elementary video and audio frame transformations. 
Some example modules are included to enable import of MPEG-1/2, 
Digital Video, and other formats. It also includes export 
modules for writing to AVI files with DivX, OpenDivX, XviD,
Digital Video or other codecs. Direct DVD transcoding is also 
supported. A set of tools is available to extract and decode 
the sources into raw video/audio streams for import and to 
enable post-processing of AVI files.

There are a few FLAVORS that add functionality to transcode:

    lzo: adds the ability to import and export AVI files
        that use LZO compression for video.
    mjpegtools: adds video encoding with mpeg2enc and audio
        encoding with mp2enc from the mjpegtools package.
        also adds the ability to import YUV4MPEG streams.
    altivec: uses altivec vector unit for a huge speed-up.
        Only works on powerpc platform with altivec hardware support.
        Altivec is present on all PowerPC G4 processors.
        Altivec is not present on G3 or earlier (60x) processors.

    quicktime: adds the ability to import and export using
        the libquicktime API, thus it adds the ability to
        import and export QuickTime-compatible .mov files.

@Reimport into new category (ok jolan@@, xsa@@, robert@@).

Update to 0.6.14; from new maintainer Jacob Meuser <jakemsr@@jakemsr.com>.

Notable changes:
- new import module for bktr(4) devices, import_bktr
- new import module for audio(4) devices, import_sunau
- export profiles
- better error checking
- uses YV12/I420 colorspace by default instead of RGB
- uses external ffmpeg/libavcodec
- optimized memcpy on i386
- many small bugs fixed
