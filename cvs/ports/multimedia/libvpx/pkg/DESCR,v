@VP8 delivers high quality video while efficiently adapting to the varying
processing and bandwidth conditions found on today's broad range of
web-connected devices. VP8's efficient bandwidth usage will mean lower
serving costs for content publishers and high quality video for end-users.
The codec's relative simplicity makes it easy to integrate into existing
environments and requires less manual tuning to produce high quality
results.
