@remove recordmydesktop which is unmaintained, doesn't quite work 100% of the time

@Recordmydesktop produces a file(default out.ogg) that contains a video
and audio recording of a desktop session. The default behavior of
recording is to mark areas that have changed(through libxdamage) and
update the frame.

Under OpenBSD, the OSS audio backend will not be usable because it needs
exclusive access to the audio hardware.
