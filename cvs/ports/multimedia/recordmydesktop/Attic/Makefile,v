@remove recordmydesktop which is unmaintained, doesn't quite work 100% of the time
and gnome-shell-recorder does a much better job.

log
@SUBDIR += is wrong: it means the makefile will pick up SUBDIR from env, thus
breaking cd /usr/ports && SUBDIR=some/path make something for
category makefiles. While there, also put spaces around += uniformously.

log
@import Record My Desktop (and gtk-frontend)

Recordmydesktop produces a file(default out.ogg) that contains a video
and audio recording of a desktop session. The default behavior of
recording is to mark areas that have changed(through libxdamage) and
update the frame.

with patch from bernd@@ to make sound recording work.
