@Update MLT to 6.0.0.

The tests statistics improved in four times (twice more tests, twice less
failings). Remember to remove old mlt packages before build, this port
is one of those who'll pick up old libs from system when present.

From Rafael Sadowski with patience, thanks!

log
@MLT is an open source multimedia framework, designed and developed
for television broadcasting. It provides a toolkit for broadcasters,
video editors, media players, transcoders, web streamers and many
more types of applications. The functionality of the system is
provided via an assortment of ready to use tools, XML authoring
components, and an extensible plug-in based API.

GPL2 (not LGPL) licensed plugins are separated in an individual
subpackage. GPL3 plugins aren't built; feel free to ask if you
really need them.
