@MLT is an open source multimedia framework, designed and developed

more types of applications. The functionality of the system is
provided via an assortment of ready to use tools, XML authoring

GPL2 (not LGPL) licensed plugins are separated in an individual
subpackage. GPL3 plugins aren't built; feel free to ask if you
really need them.
