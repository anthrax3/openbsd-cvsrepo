@Streamlink is a command-line utility that pipes video streams from
various services into a video player, such as VLC. The main purpose of
Streamlink is to allow the user to avoid buggy and CPU heavy flash
plugins but still be able to enjoy various streamed content. There is
also an API available for developers who want access to the video stream
data. This project was forked from Livestreamer, which is no longer
maintained.

Streamlink is built upon a plugin system which allows support for new
services to be easily added. Currently most of the big streaming
services are supported, such as:

* Dailymotion
* Livestream
* Twitch
* UStream
* YouTube Live

and many more.
