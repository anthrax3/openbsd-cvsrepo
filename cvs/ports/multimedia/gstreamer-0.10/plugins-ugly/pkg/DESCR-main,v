@HUGE cleanup to be in synced with upcoming gstreamer1.
Add DIST_SUBDIR, req. by jasper@@
Merge -cdda into -main for plugins-base.

@This is GStreamer, a framework for streaming media.
This package contains the "ugly" elements for gstreamer-${VERSION}.

    "When you have to shoot, shoot.  Don't talk."

There are times when the world needs a color between black and white.
Quality code to match the good's, but two-timing, backstabbing and ready
to sell your freedom down the river.  These plug-ins might have a patent
noose around their neck, or a lock-up license, or any other problem that
makes you think twice about shipping them.

@Major update to GStreamer plugins-ugly 0.10.13.

Simplify DESCR.

tested on a bulk by jasper@@

This package contains "ugly" elements for gstreamer-${VERSION}.
GStreamer plugins are splitted into:
- an essential exemplary set of elements (plugins-base)
- a set of good-quality plug-ins under LGPL (plugins-good)
- a set of good-quality plug-ins that might pose distribution problems (plugins-ugly)
- a set of plug-ins that need more quality (plugins-bad)

@Merge several (most usefull) plugins into -main.
This will help with getting good functionnality working without hunting
for dependencies.
