ffmpeg based plugins for gstreamer.

The OpenBSD devs. are VERY BAD persons.
We don't believe the ffmpeg people make ANY SENSE by refusing to
distribute shared libraries, so we distribute shared libraries,
and we build the gstreamer plugin against those libraries.

This is GPL code! We can do that!

Users who really wish to BLOAT their system and use ten UNMAINTAINED,
UNADAPTED VERSIONS OF FFMPEG on their box can compile with the included
ffmpeg source, and hope that stuff, that's mostly ever tested on 
i386-linux, works on anything as weird as (shock, horror) an OpenBSD machine.

So there...

@yeah, the gstreamer people finally made it possible to use the system
ffmpeg.

Note that their fuzzy warnings don't apply to us. This is so stupid.
Between the ffmpeg people, who only care for performance to the exclusion
of any sense (like, good luck making it work elsewhere), and the gstreamer
people, who don't care that stuff won't work elsewhere.
