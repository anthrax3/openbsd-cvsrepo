@HUGE cleanup to be in synced with upcoming gstreamer1.
Add DIST_SUBDIR, req. by jasper@@
Merge -cdda into -main for plugins-base.
@
text
@This is GStreamer, a framework for streaming media.
This package contains the "bad" elements for gstreamer-${VERSION}.

    "That an accusation?"

No perfectly groomed moustache or any amount of fine clothing is going
to cover up the truth - these plug-ins are Bad with a capital B.
They look fine on the outside, and might even appear to get the job
done, but at the end of the day they're a black sheep. Without a
golden-haired angel to watch over them, they'll probably land in an
unmarked grave at the final showdown.

log
@Major update to GStreamer plugins-bad 0.10.17.
Months (years?) of changes, refer to the source for changelog.

Simplify DESCR.
-mplex subpackage renamed to -mjpeg.

This package contains "bad" elements for gstreamer-${VERSION}.
GStreamer plugins are splitted into:
- an essential exemplary set of elements (plugins-base)
- a set of good-quality plug-ins under LGPL (plugins-good)
- a set of good-quality plug-ins that might pose distribution problems (plugins-ugly)
- a set of plug-ins that need more quality (plugins-bad)

@Enable libmms support in gstreamer-plugins-bad, yet another dependency
of Moovida/Elisa.. tweak DESCR accordingly.

This package contains "bad" plugins for gstreamer-${VERSION}.
The gstreamer people split plugins into:
- base plugins (plugins-base)
- plugins with good code and a good licence (plugins-good)
- plugins with licence issues (plugins-ugly)
- plugins with relatively bad code (plugins-bad)

* cdxaparse      parse a .dat file (VCD) into raw mpeg1
* filter         IIR, lpwsinc and bpwsinc audio filter elements
* freeze         makes a stream from buffers of data
* gsm            GSM encoder/decoder
* h264parse      parse raw h264 streams
* mms            access mms:// and mmsh:// streams
* modplug        various .mod audio decoding
* nsfdec         decode .nsf files
* replaygain     ReplayGain analysis
* rfbsrc         connect to vnc
* speed          set speed/pitch on audio/raw streams (resampler)
* tta            TTA lossless audio format handling
* videocrop      crops video into a user-defined region
* y4menc         yuv4mpeg video encoder

The following plugins are in specific packages because of dependencies:

* mplex
* neon
* real

The following plugins are not built:

* alsaspdif (no alsa on OpenBSD)
* dfbvideosink (no directFB on OpenBSD)
* dtsdec (no dts library)
* glimagesink (no accelerated GL support)
* mpeg2enc (depends on internals of mjpegtools)
* musicbrainz (not ported yet)
* soundtouch (no libsoundtouch)
* spcdec (no library)
* swfdec (library is out-of-date)

@Merge several (most usefull) plugins into -main.
This will help with getting good functionnality working without hunting
for dependencies.

feedback from Brad, sthen@@, jasper@@ and landry@@, thanks!
looks good to landry@@, ok jasper@@

Those plugins for gstreamer-${VERSION} are deemed low quality for now.
