@- merge -main and -frontend subpackages ; gstreamer-0.8 is long gone and
there is no point in splitting gstreamer anymore

@GStreamer is a streaming-media framework, based on graphs of filters which
operate on media data.  Applications using this library can do anything
from real-time sound processing to playing videos, and just about anything
else media-related.  Its plugin-based architecture means that new data
types or processing capabilities can be added simply by installing new 
plugins.

Some command-line utilities have been moved into gstreamer-frontend
to facilitate the transition to gstreamer-0.10
