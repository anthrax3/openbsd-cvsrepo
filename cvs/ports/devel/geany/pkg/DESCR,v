@Geany is a small and lightweight integrated development environment.
It was developed to provide a small and fast IDE, which has only
a few dependencies from other packages.

Basic features of Geany:
    * project management
    * plugins support
    * syntax highlighting
    * code folding
    * code completion
    * auto completion of often used constructs like if, for and while
    * auto completion of XML and HTML tags
    * call tips
    * many supported filetypes like C, Java, PHP, HTML, Python, Perl, etc.
    * symbol lists
