@With apipkg you can control the exported namespace of a python package
and greatly reduce the number of imports for your users. It is a small
pure python module that works on virtually all Python versions,
including CPython2.3 to Python3.1, Jython and PyPy. It co-operates well
with Python's help() system, custom importers (PEP302) and common
command line completion tools.
