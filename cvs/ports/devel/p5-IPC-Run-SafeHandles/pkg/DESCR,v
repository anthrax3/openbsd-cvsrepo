@IPC::Run and IPC::Run3 are both very upset when you try to use them
under environments where you have STDOUT and/or STDERR tied to something
else, such as under fastcgi.

The module adds safe-guarding code when you call IPC::Run or IPC::Run3
under such environment to make sure it always works.

If you intend to release your code to work under normal environment as
well as under fastcgi, simply use this module *after* the "IPC" modules
are loaded in your code.
