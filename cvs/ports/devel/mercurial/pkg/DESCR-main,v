@Mercurial is a distributed version control system which features:

- High-performance delta-compressed storage scheme.
- Optimized for disk layout and access efficiency.
- Complete cross-indexing of files and changesets.
- Bandwidth and CPU efficient HTTP and SSH sync protocols.
- Distributed development model supports unlimited numbers of
  developers.
- Allows arbitrary merging between developer branches.
- No waiting for locks.
- Integrity checking on repository data.
- Append-only storage model with transaction journalling.
- Fast full-repository verification.

@Several tweaks to the mercurial port:

 * Make graphical tooling for mercurial a subpackage (like the git port).
 * Bump all RUN/LIB dependants of mercurial to reflect new pkgpath.
 * Make 'hg view' work without custom paths in hgrc.
 * Substitute some shebangs in the example mercurial scripts.
