@You might want to append Smarty directory to `include_path' found in
PHP configuration file ${PREFIX}/conf/php.ini. It may look like this:

include_path = ".:/pear/lib:/var/www/pear/lib:/smarty:/var/www/smarty"

Note: First entry (`/smarty') is necessary because on OpenBSD Apache runs
      in chroot by default.

@Import Smarty 2.6.5

Although Smarty is known as a "Template Engine", it would be more
accurately described as a "Template/Presentation Framework." That is, it
provides the programmer and template designer with a wealth of tools to
automate tasks commonly dealt with at the presentation layer of an
application.
