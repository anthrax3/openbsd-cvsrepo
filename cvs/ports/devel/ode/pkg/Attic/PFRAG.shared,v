@Upstream rerolled the tar.gz and broke it by adding a root dir, switch to bz2.
Update my email, update depends, use new style and bump using REVISION.

Feedback from Kirill Bychkov.

@import ode 0.11.1

ODE is an open source, high performance library for simulating rigid
body dynamics. It is fully featured, stable, mature and platform
independent with an easy to use C/C++ API. It has advanced joint types
and integrated collision detection with friction. ODE is useful for
simulating vehicles, objects in virtual reality environments and virtual
creatures. It is currently used in many computer games, 3D authoring
tools and simulation tools.

original port by jonathan armani, with tweaks by me
