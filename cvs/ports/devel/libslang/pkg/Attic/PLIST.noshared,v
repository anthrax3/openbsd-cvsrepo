@Update slang to version 1.3.7
WARNING: You MUST pkg_delete your old version before installing this one.
Why?  because I was too lazy to teach slang about OpenBSD shared libs
(It only knows Linux shared libs) and thus only built the static lib.

This probably has broken some other ports that depend upon slang.
I'll find and fix them next
