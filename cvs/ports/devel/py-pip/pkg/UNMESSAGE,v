@Update py-pip to version 1.5.6.

We also agreed that it should be pip${MODPY_VERSION} instead of
pip-${MODPY_VERSION}, so as to fall in line with the convention we use
for other Python tools.

From Seth Jackson, OK benoit@@. Thanks.

log
@Import py-pip 1.0, from maintainer Wen Heping.

pip is a replacement for easy_install. It uses mostly the
same techniques for finding packages, so packages that were
made easy_installable should be pip-installable as well.
