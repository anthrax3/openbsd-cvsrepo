@Set MODGHC_PACKAGE_KEY and adjust plist.

Also, fix the base dependency in the .cabal file.
Upstream infrastructure "fixes" dependencies in some magic
database (or whatever) without releasing new releases, so
what you see in the .cabal file contained in the distfile
is not what you *should* see.

Hackage infrastructure fuckup: according to
http://hackage.haskell.org/package/split, this needs base<4.9, but
the included cabal file still is bound to base<4.8. So from now on,
you can't rely on .cabal files shipped with distfiles but have to
check the web pages manually.
