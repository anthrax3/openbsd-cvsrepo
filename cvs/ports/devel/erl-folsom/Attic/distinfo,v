Folsom is an Erlang based metrics system inspired by Coda Hale's
metrics. The metrics API's purpose is to collect realtime metrics from
your Erlang applications and publish them via Erlang APIs and output
plugins. folsom is not a persistent store. There are 6 types of metrics:
counters, gauges, histograms (and timers), histories, meter_readers and
meters. Metrics can be created, read and updated via the folsom_metrics
module.
