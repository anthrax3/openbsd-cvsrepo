@This package comes "Batteries Included" with many useful lenses
for the types commonly used from the Haskell Platform, and with
tools for automatically generating lenses and isomorphisms for
user-supplied data types.
The combinators in Control.Lens provide a highly generic toolbox
for composing families of getters, folds, isomorphisms, traversals,
setters and lenses and their indexed variants.
