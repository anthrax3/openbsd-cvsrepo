1.2
log
@Update to 1.6.5.
Also:
* Native make now works fine so don't use gmake.
* Disable storing of plaintext passwords for all servers in the system-wide
  'servers' config file, instead of disabling storage of all kinds of
  passwords in the system-wide 'config' config file.
  The new store-plaintext-passwords=no option, which has existed since 1.6.0,
  overrides a yes/no prompt which subversion now usually presents before
  storing passwords in plaintext. gnome-keyring stores passwords encrypted.
* Update the main DESCR to reflect current reality.
* Add a patch which fixes a broken regression test in the ruby bindings
  which accidentally slipped into 1.6.5 release.
* Put the gnome-keyring subpackage into REGRESS_DEPENDS to make
  auth-test pass (it loads DSOs at runtime and can't find them if
  the gnome-keyring subpackage isn't installed).

Tested on i386 by me and alek@@, on i386/amd64 by steven@@,
and on sparc64 by Edd Barrett.

1.1
log
@by default subversion caches passwords in cleartext under ~/.subversion.
the doco claims this is safe cos the directory has extremely restricted
permissions, but noone i know agrees with this or feels safe. this change
installs a config under /etc/subversion/config that disables this
behaviour.
