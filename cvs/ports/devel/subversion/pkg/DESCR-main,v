@Fix gnome-keyring description in DESCR-main, and other various DESCR tweaks.

@Apache Subversion exists to be universally recognized and adopted as an
open-source, centralized version control system characterized by its
reliability as a safe haven for valuable data; the simplicity of its
model and usage; and its ability to support the needs of a wide variety
of users and projects, from individuals to large-scale enterprise
operations.

Note that you need to install the following subpackages to gain the
appropriate functionality:
        -perl           Perl bindings to Subversion
        -python         Python bindings to Subversion
        -ruby           Ruby bindings to Subversion
        -ap2            Apache httpd 2 modules for Subversion
        -gnome-keyring  Store Subversion passwords in gnome-keyring

Also note that plaintext-password caching is disabled by default by
setting "store-plaintext-passwords" to "no" in ${SYSCONFDIR}/subversion/servers.
This is a different default behaviour to a standard Subversion install,
which would ask the user before storing passwords in plaintext.

@- convert gnome-shared-keyring to a true FLAVOR rather than a
pseudo-flavour, it affects the -main package by building with pthread
(we don't want that by default, it affects e.g. svn diff | less).

- roll various PFRAG.shared-foo for the subpackages into PLIST-foo

- add a comment noting that autoconf should be 2.63

- bump PKGNAMEs

Subversion is a free/open-source version control system. That is,
Subversion manages files and directories over time. A tree of files
is placed into a central repository. The repository is much like an
ordinary file server, except that it remembers every change ever made
to your files and directories. This allows you to recover older versions
of your data, or examine the history of how your data changed.
In this regard, many people think of a version control system as a
sort of time machine.

@Update to 1.6.5.
Also:
* Native make now works fine so don't use gmake.
* Disable storing of plaintext passwords for all servers in the system-wide
  'servers' config file, instead of disabling storage of all kinds of
  passwords in the system-wide 'config' config file.
  The new store-plaintext-passwords=no option, which has existed since 1.6.0,
  overrides a yes/no prompt which subversion now usually presents before
  storing passwords in plaintext. gnome-keyring stores passwords encrypted.
* Update the main DESCR to reflect current reality.
* Add a patch which fixes a broken regression test in the ruby bindings
  which accidentally slipped into 1.6.5 release.
* Put the gnome-keyring subpackage into REGRESS_DEPENDS to make
  auth-test pass (it loads DSOs at runtime and can't find them if
  the gnome-keyring subpackage isn't installed).

Tested on i386 by me and alek@@, on i386/amd64 by steven@@,
and on sparc64 by Edd Barrett.

Due to known problems with Berkeley db on macppc you can only create
filesystem (fsfs) based repositories. No problems exist when subversion
is only used as a client, however.

@note that we're changing the default for auth credential caching in our
package.

steven requested i add ruby to the list of subpackages while im here.
