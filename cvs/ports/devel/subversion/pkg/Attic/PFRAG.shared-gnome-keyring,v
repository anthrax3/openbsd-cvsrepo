1.2
log
@- convert gnome-shared-keyring to a true FLAVOR rather than a
pseudo-flavour, it affects the -main package by building with pthread
(we don't want that by default, it affects e.g. svn diff | less).

- roll various PFRAG.shared-foo for the subpackages into PLIST-foo

- add a comment noting that autoconf should be 2.63

- bump PKGNAMEs

ok stsp (maintainer).
