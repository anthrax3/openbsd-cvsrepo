@Remove libavl -- it's outdated and according to the doc:

libavl is not intended to be installed as a shared library.  Instead,
its source files are meant to be included in programs directly.
<...>
As a result, there is no real "installation procedure" for libavl.
<...> hard to imagine a practical use for them other than as tests and
demonstrations.
