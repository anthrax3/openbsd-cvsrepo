1.3
log
@These Perl modules come with OpenBSD as of 3.3.
@
text
@The Storable package brings you persistency for your perl
data structures containing SCALAR, ARRAY, HASH or REF
objects, i.e. anything that can be conveniently stored to
disk and retrieved at a later time.

It can be used in the regular procedural way by calling
store with a reference to the object to store, and
providing a file name. The routine returns undef for I/O
problems or other internal error, a true value otherwise.
Serious errors are propagated as a die exception.
