@Tox as is a generic virtualenv management and test command line tool
you can use for:

* checking your package installs correctly with different Python
versions and interpreters

* running your tests in each of the environments, configuring your
test tool of choice

* acting as a frontend to Continuous Integration servers, greatly
reducing boilerplate and merging CI and shell-based testing.
