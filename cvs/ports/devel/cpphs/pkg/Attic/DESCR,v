@Use cabal and build the library on archs with ghc (i386 and amd64),
because jasper@@ wants the cpphs library.
Put the library into a separate subpackage (hs-cpphs).
Shorten DESCR-main (formerly DESCR).

Tested with both ghc and nhc98 (the latter on armish).

@Rightly or wrongly, the C pre-processor is widely used in Haskell
source code. It enables conditional compilation for different
compilers, different versions of the same compiler, and different OS
platforms. It is also occasionally used for its macro language, which
can enable certain forms of platform-specific detail-filling, such as
the tedious boilerplate generation of instance definitions and FFI
declarations. However, there are two problems with cpp, aside from the
obvious aesthetic ones:

  * For some Haskell systems, notably Hugs on Windows, a true cpp is
    not available by default.
  * Even for the other Haskell systems, the common cpp provided by the
    gcc 3.x and 4.x series has changed subtly in ways that are
    incompatible with Haskell's syntax. There have always been
    problems with, for instance, string gaps, and prime characters
    in identifiers. These problems are only going to get worse.

So, it seemed right to provide an alternative to cpp, both more
compatible with Haskell, and itself written in Haskell so that it
can be distributed with compilers. This version of the C pre-processor
is pretty-much feature-complete, and compatible with the -traditional
style.

Update to 1.4.
Tweak WANTLIB (gmp only required when built with ghc).
Take maintainership.

Not that some regression tests fail. This will be fixed in the next
release.
