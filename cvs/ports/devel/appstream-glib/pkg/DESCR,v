@This library provides GObjects and helper methods to make it easy to
read and write AppStream metadata. It also provides a simple DOM
implementation that makes it easy to edit nodes and convert to and from
the standardized XML representation.

What this library allows you to do:

 * Read and write compressed AppStream XML files
 * Add and search for applications in an application store
 * Get screenshot image data and release announcements
 * Easily retrieve the best application data for the current locale
 * Efficiently interface with more heavy-weight parsers like expat
