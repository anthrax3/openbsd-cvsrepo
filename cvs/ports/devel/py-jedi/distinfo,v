Jedi is a static analysis tool for Python that can be used in IDEs/editors.
Its historic focus is autocompletion, but does static analysis for now as
well. Jedi is fast and is very well tested. It understands Python on a deeper
level than all other static analysis frameworks for Python.

Jedi has support for two different goto functions. Jedi understands
docstrings and you can use Jedi autocompletion in your REPL as well.
