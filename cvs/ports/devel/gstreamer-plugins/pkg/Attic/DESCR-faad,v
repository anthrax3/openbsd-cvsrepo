1.1
log
@big clean-up of gstreamer-plugins, allows a lot more plugins to compile
correctly, fix build in lots of cases, since there is a HUGE number of
things gst will try to pick up.

fix the framework for MULTI_PACKAGES to not do insane stuff, and simplify
the main Makefile greatly.

Set up SHARED_ONLY.

Some more clean-up to do.
Someone will have to come up with descriptions and comments more accurate,
and do more plugins testing...
