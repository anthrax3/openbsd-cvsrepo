@The GNU Binutils are a collection of binary tools. The main ones are:
  * ld - the GNU linker.
  * as - the GNU assembler.
    
But they also include:
  * addr2line - Converts addresses into filenames and line numbers.
  * ar - A utility for creating, modifying and extracting from
    archives.
  * c++filt - Filter to demangle encoded C++ symbols.
  * gprof - Displays profiling information.
  * nlmconv - Converts object code into an NLM.
  * nm - Lists symbols from object files.
  * objcopy - Copys and translates object files.
  * objdump - Displays information from object files.
  * ranlib - Generates an index to the contents of an archive.
  * readelf - Displays information from any ELF format object file.
  * size - Lists the section sizes of an object or archive file.
  * strings - Lists printable strings from files.
  * strip - Discards symbols.
  * windres - A compiler for Windows resource files.
    
Most of these programs use BFD, the Binary File Descriptor library, to
do low-level manipulation. Many of them also use the opcodes library
to assemble and disassemble machine instructions.
