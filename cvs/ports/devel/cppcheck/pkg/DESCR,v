@Cppcheck is a command-line tool that tries to detect bugs that your
C/C++ compiler doesn't see. It is versatile, and can check non-standard
code including various compiler extensions, inline assembly code, etc.
Its internal preprocessor can handle includes, macros, and several
preprocessor commands. While Cppcheck is highly configurable, you can
start using it just by giving it a path to the source code.

Cppcheck is an analysis tool for C/C++ code. Unlike C/C++ compilers and
many other analysis tools, we don't detect syntax errors. Cppcheck only
detects the types of bugs that the compilers normally fail to detect.
The goal is no false positives.
