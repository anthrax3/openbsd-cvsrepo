@This library offers an alternative parallel programming API to that
provided by the parallel package.

The 'Par' monad allows the simple description of parallel computations,
and can be used to add parallelism to pure Haskell code.  The basic
API is straightforward: the monad supports forking and simple
communication in terms of 'IVar's.

The library comes with an efficient work-stealing implementation,
but the internals are also exposed so that you can build your own
scheduler if necessary.
