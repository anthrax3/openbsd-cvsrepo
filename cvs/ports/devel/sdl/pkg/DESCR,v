@Simple DirectMedia Layer is a cross-platform multimedia
library designed to provide fast access to the graphics
framebuffer and audio device. It is used by MPEG playback
software, emulators, and many popular games.

Packages can be built with additional FLAVORs:

  aa:   SDL built with ASCII art support.
	This FLAVOR requires the aalib package.

  no_x11: Built without X11.

@remove arts and esd backends

from Brad, thanks

  caca:	SDL built with colour ASCII art support.

log
@- remove the sun FLAVOR and add sunaudio support by default

note: people running with non-default FLAVOR(s) will need to update their
package manually as "pkg_add -u" won't be able to cope with this change

discussed with and ok steven@@, "theorical ok" from pvalchev@@

@Drop oss flavor.
Note: If you use the esd flavor you'll still be using ossaudio, due to
esound itself linking with it.  So, we can't completely get rid of it yet.

@- Implement a native audio driver by <vedge2@@vedge.com.ar> as a "sun"

"sun" or "oss" is possible.
