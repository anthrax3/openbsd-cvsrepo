@Upgrade to SDL-1.2.1
Various improvements, including OpenBSD native audio.

* Fix audio device path.  This has caused audio not to work without the
esd flavor before, many people (including me) had link to /dev/dsp because
of linux emulation programs and haven't noticed the problem.
* Fix OSS audio.
* Sync libtool patches
* Properly include @@SYSTEM_LIBS@@ in sdl-config to ensure proper linking
of SDL applications.
