1.2
log
@cleanup sndio backend
- rename from "libsndio" to "sndio"
- remove support for "frame tick" synchronization; nothing uses it
- as with many other sndio backends, the audio device block size is the
  buffer-write-size the application wants and there are 2 blocks per
  device buffer
- if SDL will resample, increase the audio block and buffer size by
  the same ratio, so that device latency (or how much *time* the
  application has between write()s to not let the buffer underrun) does
  not change
- allow applications to disable conversions

tested with almost every port that uses this code (exceptions being some
games that require non-free game data) on a device most likely to be
affected by the changes (azalia(4) that only does 44.1 or 48 kHz s16)

unoverriding conversion disabling exposes brokenness in a few other
ports, those will be fixed soon
