1.1
log
@Nobody loves you, qt-creator, except three people: Caspar Schutijser,
Rafael Sadowski and me.

So lets move on and put it in. Nowadays there is no point in having
a separate qt-creator with support for older Qt's, and 4.1.0 works
with egdb at least.

Most of the work was done by Caspar, last rollup from Rafael, commit by me.
