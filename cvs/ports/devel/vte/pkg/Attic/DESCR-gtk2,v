@VTE is a library (libvte) implementing a terminal emulator widget for
GTK+, and a minimal sample application (vte) using that.  Vte is
mainly used in gnome-terminal, but can also be used to embed a
console/terminal in games, editors, IDEs, etc.

This package provides vte with gtk+2 support.

@Make this port use real FLAVORS, not PSEUDO_FLAVORS, prodded by espie@@
While here, remove the gtk3 FLAVOR (we build with gtk+3 support by
default) and add a gtk2 FLAVOR.
Quite some plumbing, hopefully I got this right...

ok jasper@@
