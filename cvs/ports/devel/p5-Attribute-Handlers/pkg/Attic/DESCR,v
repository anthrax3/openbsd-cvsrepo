1.2
log
@These Perl modules come with OpenBSD as of 3.3.
@
text
@This module, when inherited by a package, allows that package's
class to define attribute handler subroutines for specific attributes.

Variables and subroutines subsequently defined in that package, or
in packages derived from that package may be given attributes with
the same names as the attribute handler subroutines, which will
then be called at the end of the compilation phase (i.e. in a `CHECK'
block).
