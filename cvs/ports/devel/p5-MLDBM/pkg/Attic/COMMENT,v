This module can be used to store multidimensional hash structures
in tied hashes (including DBM files).

Optionally, you can also switch to other serializing packages such
as FreezeThaw and Storable.  Storable provides much greater speeds,
and the performance of FreezeThaw is comparable to Data::Dumper.
