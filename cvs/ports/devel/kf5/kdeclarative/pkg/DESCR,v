@KDeclarative provides integration of QML and KDE work spaces.
It's comprises two parts: a library used by the C++ part of your application
to intergrate QML with KDE Frameworks specific features, and a series of
QML imports that offer bindings to some of the Frameworks.

@Import KDE Frameworks 5.21.0. Somewhat outdated, but we need to move on.

This does not include NetworkManager and ModemManager bindings, for obvious
reasons. But there is the Bluez-Qt binding included, which acts as a stub,
allowing KDE stuff relying on it to compile.

Also, we ship outdated version of Baloo, because newer versions rely on
the MDB library which we don't have - and won't have until UBC is fixed.

Input from many, tested by kirby@@ and awolk@@, final okay awolk@@ - thanks!
