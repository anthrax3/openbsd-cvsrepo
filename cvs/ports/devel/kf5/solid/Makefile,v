@Change directory for QML files from ${PREFIX}/lib/qml/ to ${MODQT_LIBDIR}/qml.

This way QML-based KDE5 apps could pick up their dependencies automatically.

Based on discussion with rsadowski@@ and czarkoff@@.

1.1.1.1
log
@Import KDE Frameworks 5.21.0. Somewhat outdated, but we need to move on.

This does not include NetworkManager and ModemManager bindings, for obvious
reasons. But there is the Bluez-Qt binding included, which acts as a stub,
allowing KDE stuff relying on it to compile.

Also, we ship outdated version of Baloo, because newer versions rely on
the MDB library which we don't have - and won't have until UBC is fixed.

Input from many, tested by kirby@@ and awolk@@, final okay awolk@@ - thanks!
