@This library contains simple XML-RPC Client support. It is a complete
client and is quite easy to use. Only one interface is exposed to the
world, kxmlrpcclient/client.h and of that interface, you only need to
use 3 methods: setUrl, setUserAgent and call.

A small note on authentication. If you will be accessing an XML-RPC server
which uses HTTP-AUTH, simply set the user and pass in the URL. To use
Digest authentication, call setDigestAuthEnabled(true).

@Import KDE Frameworks 5.21.0. Somewhat outdated, but we need to move on.

This does not include NetworkManager and ModemManager bindings, for obvious
reasons. But there is the Bluez-Qt binding included, which acts as a stub,
allowing KDE stuff relying on it to compile.

Also, we ship outdated version of Baloo, because newer versions rely on
the MDB library which we don't have - and won't have until UBC is fixed.

Input from many, tested by kirby@@ and awolk@@, final okay awolk@@ - thanks!
