@When a user is interacting with a computer, there are three main areas of
contextual information that may affect the behaviour of the system: who the user
is, where they are, and what they are doing.

Activities deal with the last one. An activity might be "developing a KDE
application", "studying 19th century art", "composing music" or "watching funny
videos". Each of these activites may involve multiple applications, and a single
application may be used in multiple activities (for example, most activities are
likely to involve using a web browser, but different activities will probably
involve different websites).

This package contains a library for accessing the usage data collected by
the activities system.

@Import KDE Frameworks 5.21.0. Somewhat outdated, but we need to move on.

This does not include NetworkManager and ModemManager bindings, for obvious
reasons. But there is the Bluez-Qt binding included, which acts as a stub,
allowing KDE stuff relying on it to compile.

Also, we ship outdated version of Baloo, because newer versions rely on
the MDB library which we don't have - and won't have until UBC is fixed.

Input from many, tested by kirby@@ and awolk@@, final okay awolk@@ - thanks!
