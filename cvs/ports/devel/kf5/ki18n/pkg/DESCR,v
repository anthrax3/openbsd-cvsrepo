@KI18n provides functionality for internationalizing user interface text
in applications, based on the GNU Gettext translation system.
It wraps the standard Gettext functionality, so that the programmers
and translators can use the familiar Gettext tools and workflows.

KI18n provides additional functionality as well, for both programmers
and translators, which can help to achieve a higher overall quality
of source and translated text. This includes argument capturing,
customizable markup, and translation scripting.

1.1.1.1
log
@Import KDE Frameworks 5.21.0. Somewhat outdated, but we need to move on.

This does not include NetworkManager and ModemManager bindings, for obvious
reasons. But there is the Bluez-Qt binding included, which acts as a stub,
allowing KDE stuff relying on it to compile.

Also, we ship outdated version of Baloo, because newer versions rely on
the MDB library which we don't have - and won't have until UBC is fixed.

Input from many, tested by kirby@@ and awolk@@, final okay awolk@@ - thanks!
