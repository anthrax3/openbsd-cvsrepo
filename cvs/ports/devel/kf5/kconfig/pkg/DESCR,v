@KConfig provides an advanced configuration system. It is made of two parts:
KConfigCore and KConfigGui.

KConfigCore provides access to the configuration files themselves. It features:

- Code generation: describe your configuration in an XML file, and use
  `kconfig_compiler to generate classes that read and write configuration
  entries.
- Cascading configuration files (global settings overridden by local settings).
- Optional shell expansion support (see [docs/options.md](@@ref options)).
- The ability to lock down configuration options (see
  [docs/options.md](@@ref options)).

KConfigGui provides a way to hook widgets to the configuration so that they are
automatically initialized from the configuration and automatically propagate
their changes to their respective configuration files.

@Import KDE Frameworks 5.21.0. Somewhat outdated, but we need to move on.

This does not include NetworkManager and ModemManager bindings, for obvious
reasons. But there is the Bluez-Qt binding included, which acts as a stub,
allowing KDE stuff relying on it to compile.

Also, we ship outdated version of Baloo, because newer versions rely on
the MDB library which we don't have - and won't have until UBC is fixed.

Input from many, tested by kirby@@ and awolk@@, final okay awolk@@ - thanks!
