@Attica is a Qt library that implements the Open Collaboration Services API
version 1.6.  The REST API is defined here:
http://freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/open-collaboration-services/

It grants easy access to the services such as querying information about
persons and contents.  The library is used in KNewStuff3 as content provider.
In order to integrate with KDE's Plasma Desktop, a platform plugin exists
in kdebase.

@Import KDE Frameworks 5.21.0. Somewhat outdated, but we need to move on.

This does not include NetworkManager and ModemManager bindings, for obvious
reasons. But there is the Bluez-Qt binding included, which acts as a stub,
allowing KDE stuff relying on it to compile.

Also, we ship outdated version of Baloo, because newer versions rely on
the MDB library which we don't have - and won't have until UBC is fixed.

Input from many, tested by kirby@@ and awolk@@, final okay awolk@@ - thanks!
