@KTextEditor provides a powerful text editor component that you can embed in your
application, either as a KPart or using the KF5::TextEditor library (if you need
more control).

The text editor component contains many useful features, from syntax
highlighting and automatic indentation to advanced scripting support, making it
suitable for everything from a simple embedded text-file editor to an advanced
IDE.

@Import KDE Frameworks 5.21.0. Somewhat outdated, but we need to move on.

This does not include NetworkManager and ModemManager bindings, for obvious
reasons. But there is the Bluez-Qt binding included, which acts as a stub,
allowing KDE stuff relying on it to compile.

Also, we ship outdated version of Baloo, because newer versions rely on
the MDB library which we don't have - and won't have until UBC is fixed.

Input from many, tested by kirby@@ and awolk@@, final okay awolk@@ - thanks!
