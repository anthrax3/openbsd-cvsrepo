@This library contains classes to improve the handling of icons
in applications using the KDE Frameworks. Provided are:

- KIconDialog: Dialog class to let the user select an icon
    from the list of installed icons.
- KIconButton: Custom button class that displays an icon.
    When clicking it, the user can change it using the icon dialog.
- KIconEffect: Applies various colorization effects to icons,
    which can be used to create selected/disabled icon images.

Other classes in this repository are used internally by the icon
theme configuration dialogs, and should not be used by applications.

@Import KDE Frameworks 5.21.0. Somewhat outdated, but we need to move on.

This does not include NetworkManager and ModemManager bindings, for obvious
reasons. But there is the Bluez-Qt binding included, which acts as a stub,
allowing KDE stuff relying on it to compile.

Also, we ship outdated version of Baloo, because newer versions rely on
the MDB library which we don't have - and won't have until UBC is fixed.

Input from many, tested by kirby@@ and awolk@@, final okay awolk@@ - thanks!
