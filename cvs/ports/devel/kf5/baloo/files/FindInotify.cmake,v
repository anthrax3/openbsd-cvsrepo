@# - Find inotify implementation
# Checks if OS supports inotify mechanism.
# This module defines the following variables:
#  Inotify_INCLUDE_DIRS - The include directories needed to use libinotify.
#  Inotify_LIBRARY_DIRS - The link directories needed to use libinotify.
#  Inotify_LIBRARIES    - The libraries (linker flags) needed to use libinotify, if any.
#  Inotify_FOUND        - Is set if and only if libinotify was detected.
#
# The following cache variables are also available to set or use:
#   Inotify_LIBRARY     - The external library providing inotify_*(), if any.
#   Inotify_INCLUDE_DIR - The directory holding the libinotify header.
#   Inotify_LIBRARY_DIR - The directory holding the libinotify library.

@Import KDE Frameworks 5.21.0. Somewhat outdated, but we need to move on.

This does not include NetworkManager and ModemManager bindings, for obvious
reasons. But there is the Bluez-Qt binding included, which acts as a stub,
allowing KDE stuff relying on it to compile.

Also, we ship outdated version of Baloo, because newer versions rely on
the MDB library which we don't have - and won't have until UBC is fixed.

Input from many, tested by kirby@@ and awolk@@, final okay awolk@@ - thanks!
