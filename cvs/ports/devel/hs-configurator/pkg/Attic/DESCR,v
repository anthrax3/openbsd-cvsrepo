@Configuration management library for programs and daemons.
Features include:
* Automatic, dynamic reloading in response to modifications to
  configuration files.
* A simple, but flexible, configuration language, supporting several
  of the most commonly needed types of data, along with
  interpolation of strings from the configuration or the system
  environment (e.g. @@$(HOME)@@).
* Subscription-based notification of changes to configuration
  properties.
* An @@import@@ directive allows the configuration of a complex
  application to be split across several smaller files, or common
  configuration data to be shared across several applications.
