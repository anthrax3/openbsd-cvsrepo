@Remove duplicate version of ruby-rack-test.  It was originally imported
under devel, and then later imported by me under www.  Since stuff
depends on the www version and it is more up to date, keep that version.

Add goo to update automatically from devel version to www version.

Discovered by claudio@@.  OK sthen@@.

@Rack::Test is a small, simple testing API for Rack apps.
It can be used on its own or as a reusable starting point
for Web frameworks and testing libraries to build on.
Most of its initial functionality is an extraction of
Merb 1.0's request helpers feature.
