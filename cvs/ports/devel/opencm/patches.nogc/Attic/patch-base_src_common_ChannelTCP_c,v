@update to 0.1.2alpha5pl2 from 0.1.0alpha18

see http://www.opencm.org/news.html for hilights of this update, major
noteworthy changes include:

- sxd has gone away, gzfs is 'interim' while 'sxd2' is almost ready
- if you have an old sxd repository, read the mailing list archives for
  how to update (use an interum version)
- an incompatible update to the server/client protocol requires that you
  update both at the same time

(as a reminder, this is 'alpha' and as such is subject to incompatible changes
 like the above.  expect more to come when sxd2 emerges)

Also, add a 'nogc' flavor that removes the dependency on boehm-gc, at the
cost of not free()'ing all memory allocated (read: at the moment, most).
