@update to 0.1.2alpha5pl2 from 0.1.0alpha18

see http://www.opencm.org/news.html for hilights of this update, major
noteworthy changes include:

- sxd has gone away, gzfs is 'interim' while 'sxd2' is almost ready
- if you have an old sxd repository, read the mailing list archives for
  how to update (use an interum version)
- an incompatible update to the server/client protocol requires that you
  update both at the same time

(as a reminder, this is 'alpha' and as such is subject to incompatible changes
 like the above.  expect more to come when sxd2 emerges)

Also, add a 'nogc' flavor that removes the dependency on boehm-gc, at the
cost of not free()'ing all memory allocated (read: at the moment, most).

1.1.1.1

@OpenCM alpha16

OpenCM is designed as a secure, high-integrity replacement for CVS. A list of
the key features can be found on the features page. While not as ``feature
rich'' as CVS, it supports some useful things that CVS lacks. Briefly, OpenCM
provides first-class support for renames and configuration, cryptographic
authentication and access control, and first-class branches. 

The OpenCM project was originally started because we needed a secure,
high-integrity configuration management system for the EROS project.
Alternatives, such as BitKeeper, Subversion, and PerForce, either did not
meet our requirements or were not available at the time the work started. We
had previously used CVS, but it's absence of real branches and configurations
finally drove us to build a better tool.
