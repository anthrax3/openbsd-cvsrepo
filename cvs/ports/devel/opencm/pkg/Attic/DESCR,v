@OpenCM is designed as a secure, high-integrity replacement for CVS. A
list of the key features can be found on the features page. While not as
``feature rich'' as CVS, it supports some useful things that CVS lacks.
Briefly, OpenCM provides first-class support for renames and
configuration, cryptographic authentication and access control, and
first-class branches. 

The OpenCM project was originally started because we needed a secure,
high-integrity configuration management system for the EROS project.
Alternatives, such as BitKeeper, Subversion, and PerForce, either did
not meet our requirements or were not available at the time the work
started. We had previously used CVS, but it's absence of real branches
and configurations finally drove us to build a better tool.
