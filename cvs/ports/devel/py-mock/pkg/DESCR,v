@Update to py-mock 1.3.0

@mock is a Python module that provides a core Mock class. It removes
the need to create a host of stubs throughout your test suite. After
performing an action, you can make assertions about which methods /
attributes were used and arguments they were called with. You can also
specify return values and set needed attributes in the normal way.

The mock module also provides utility functions / objects to assist
with testing, particularly monkey patching.
