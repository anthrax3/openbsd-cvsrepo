@GStreamer is a streaming-media framework, based on graphs of filters which
operate on media data.   This package contains front-ends to the other
programs.

These binaries were split out so that people can install both gstreamer-0.8
and gstreamer-0.10. The front-end know about version numbers, so you can
install whatever version is most convenient, and have it use the correct
gstreamer subsystem by saying e.g., gst-launch --gst-mm=0.8

log
@split off frontends into their own packages, and mark that there will
be no conflict at all with gstreamer-0.10.
