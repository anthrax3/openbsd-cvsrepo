@dconf is a simple key/value storage system that is heavily optimised for
reading.  This makes it an ideal system for storing user preferences
(which are read 1000s of times for each time the user changes one).  It
was created with this usecase in mind.

dconf is a low-level configuration system. Its main purpose is to
