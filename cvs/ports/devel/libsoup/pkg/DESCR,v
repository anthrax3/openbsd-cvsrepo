@tweak description for libsoup; it's now a general HTTP library as well
as handling SOAP. ok ajacoutot@@
@
text
@libsoup is an HTTP client/server library for GNOME. It uses GObjects and
the glib main loop, to integrate well with GNOME applications, and also
has a synchronous API, for use in threaded applications.

Features include:

    Both asynchronous (GMainLoop and callback-based) and synchronous APIs
    Automatically caches connections
    SSL Support using GnuTLS
    Proxy support, including authentication and SSL tunneling
    Client support for Digest, NTLM, and Basic authentication
    Server support for Digest and Basic authentication
    Client and server support for XML-RPC

@There is no need for a -gnome subpackage anymore; -main has exactly the

Soup is a SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) implementation in C.

It provides an queued asynchronous callback-based mechanism for sending
and servicing SOAP requests, and a WSDL (Web Service Definition
Language) to C compiler which generates client stubs and server
skeletons for easily calling and implementing SOAP methods.

@Update to libsoup 2.26.0, needed by the upcoming webkit update.
Split it into -main and -gnome, the latter providing gnome-specific
libsoup library. While here, prettify Makefile and set HOMEPAGE.
