@Update devel/spidermonkey to 17.0, matching the JS engine from firefox 17

- adjust PKGSPEC to match the new versions.
- gnome 3.10 will soon start relying on it, depending ports will be
  fixed in a short moment.
- library is now mosjs-17.0.
- remove lots of patches merged upstream (see bug #735599)
- only remaining patch to jsval.h backported from #618485 for sparc64.
- tested on i386/macppc/amd64/sparc64, alpha/mips64* & hppa will be
  tested soon.

@Import devel/spidermonkey 1.8.5

- built from the official upstream release
- needed for upcoming gnome/js update
- this is not an update to lang/spidermonkey, as that new version was
  built upon Ffx 4 js engine and probably only works on amd64/i386/ppc.
It builds on sparc64 but is broken at runtime. Not marking BROKEN-* to
allow depending ports to build. Other archs untested.
- special care was taken to ensure it doesnt conflict with
  lang/spidermonkey (install versionned binaries/headers..)
- ports wanting to use it should use devel/spidermonkey>=1.8,<1.9 to
  ensure the correct version is picked up

Tested in an amd64 bulk build.
