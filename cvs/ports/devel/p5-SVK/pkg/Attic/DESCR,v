@Svk is a decentralized version control system. While Subversion (svn) 
aims to take over the CVS user base, svk attempts to take over the user 
base of the other version control systems, including people who have 
already switched to another version control system, as well as people 
who have not yet started using a version control system. It is written 
in Perl and uses Subversion's underlying filesystem.
