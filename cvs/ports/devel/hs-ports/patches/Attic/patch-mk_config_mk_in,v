This isn't maintained any longer, and, according to Don Stewart, should
be removed. (And it doesn't build with recent Haskell compilers).

@Import hs-ports-0.4.1, a library for concurrent and distributed Haskell

	The Haskell Ports Library (HPL) supports concurrent and distributed
	computing in the IO monad _without_ relying on mutable variables.
	Instead, it supplies monotone single-assignment variables and ports
	abstractions. Ports are an abstraction for modelling variables whose
	values evolve over time without the need to resort to mutable
	variable, such as IORefs. More precisely, a port represents all values
	that a time-dependent variable successively takes as a stream, where
	each element of the stream corresponds to a state change.

	Ports are ideally suited for purely functional GUI interfaces that
	completely avoid the use of mutable variables. It is planned to extend
	the library to interaction between different processes possibly
	located on distinct processing nodes.
