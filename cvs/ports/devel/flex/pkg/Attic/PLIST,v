1.1.1.1
log
@Import devel/flex. This is flex v2.5.35, which uses m4 to generate the
scanners and is a required dependency to update a number of ports.

Following analysis of bulk build and base build logs with this done as
an update to /usr/src/usr.bin/lex mostly over p2k9 it's clear this has
incompatibilities with existing scanners (including minor SUS breakage)
so at this time it's being imported as a port rather than updating base.

Port originally from Brad with some changes by myself (executable
file now named gflex, and use base m4 not GNU m4 - requires /usr/bin/m4
with -P support; 2009/10/14 or newer).

Discussed with and requested by many. ok ajacoutot, jasper, Brad.
