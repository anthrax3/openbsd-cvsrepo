@Update to 1.15.
Some stuff went upstream.
Instead of doing all that ridiculous work in the Makefile,
I've moved it all to Tcllib's installer itself.
This should make future updates a lot less painful.

Thanks to Steve Havelka for distfile hosting.

@A collection of pure-Tcl utility modules for Tcl that provide a wide
variety of functionality, from implementations of standard data
structures to implementations of common networking protocols.
The intent is to collect commonly used functions into a single
library which users can rely on to be available and stable.
