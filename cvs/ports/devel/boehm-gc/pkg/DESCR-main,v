log
@Split boehm-gc into -main and -atomic subpackages.
The latter contains libatomic_ops-1.2, which is developed inside boehm-gc,
as stated on libatomic_ops homepage. No change on -main subpackage.
libatomic_ops may be used by a future eventual pulseaudio port, which is
being worked on.

@The Boehm-Weiser garbage collection package, for C and C++ -
garbage collection and memory leak detection libraries.

A garbage collector is something which automatically frees malloc'd
memory for you by working out what parts of memory your program
no longer has pointers to. As a result, garbage collectors can also
inform you of memory leaks (if they find memory they can free, it means
you have lost all of your pointers to it, but you didn't free it).

C programs should run without change. C++ programs must include a header
to use garbage collection. See the man page and header files.
