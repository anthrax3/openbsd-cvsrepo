@- use __data_start symbol to find the beginning of the data sections
and adjust boehm-gc to deal with any number of holes that may appear
between __data_start and _end. (requires -current binutils)
- work-around libpthread bugs that prevent sigsuspend() from working
in a signal handler by using pthread_suspend_np() + an arch/libpthread
specific offset to obtain the suspended thread's stack pointer.

thanks to sthen@@ and jasper@@ for access to other arches. discussed
with todd@@

Update to 7.0.

Most work done by kurt@@, who got bleeding eyes and has been trapped
into pthread issues because some of us (me and Stuart Henderson)
were slopyy and applied some patches only partial. A big sorry to
kurt@@ for this waste of time!

Tested by many. Intermediate ok's (IIRC) from kurt@@, naddy@@ and todd@@.
