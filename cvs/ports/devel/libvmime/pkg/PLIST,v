@Import libvmime-0.8.1

VMime is a powerful C++ class library for working with MIME messages and
Internet messaging services like IMAP, POP or SMTP.  With VMime you can
parse, generate and modify messages, and also connect to store and
transport services to receive or send messages over the Internet.  The
library offers all the features to build a complete mail client.
