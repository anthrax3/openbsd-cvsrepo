@import p5-List-MoreUtils-XS 0.418
p5-List-MoreUtils has been split in two modules upstream.
Better use the software in our ports tree as build dependency, patch 
away the included modules.
OK sthen@@

Comment:
provide compiled List::MoreUtils functions

Description:
All of the functions are implementable in only a couple of lines
of Perl code.  Using the functions from this module however should
give slightly better performance as everything is implemented in
C.  The pure-Perl implementation of these functions only serves as
a fallback in case the C portions of this module couldn't be compiled
on this machine.
