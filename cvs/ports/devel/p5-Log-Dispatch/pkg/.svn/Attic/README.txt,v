@Initial import of Log-Dispatch-2.10

Log::Dispatch is a suite of OO modules for logging messages to
multiple outputs, each of which can have a minimum and maximum log
level.  It is designed to be easily subclassed, both for creating a
new dispatcher object and particularly for creating new outputs.

It also allows both global (dispatcher level) and local (logging
object) message formatting callbacks which allows greater flexibility
and should reduce the need for subclassing.
