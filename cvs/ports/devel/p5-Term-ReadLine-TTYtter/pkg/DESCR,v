@This is Term::ReadLine::TTYtter. It is a modified version of T::RL:Perl
with several new nonstandard features specific to TTYtter, but may be
useful for other applications.

It also allows UTF-8 charaters to be entered without crashing, and adds
a counter so you can see how many characters you've entered (which is a
big deal for Twitter and other microblogging platforms).

These methods are additionally defined, which are non-standard:

* removereadline method: erases the current prompt from the screen
* redisplay method: repaints the current prompt from the screen
* hook_background_control method: connects the interactive readline
       prompt to a PID specified by $main::child. The PID is then sent
       signal SIGUSR1 when a character is beginning processing (i.e.,
       the process needs to NOT write to the screen), and SIGUSR2 when
       done (i.e., the process can write again).
* hook_use_ansi: same, but connects to $main::dont_use_counter (1 =
       disable_counter). Useful for prompts where this is irrelevant.
* hook_no_tco: this is Twitter specific. See code.

(The use of hooks into $main:: was so that the calling convention of
&readline would not have to be disturbed to pass additional options.)
