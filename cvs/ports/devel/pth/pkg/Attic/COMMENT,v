Pth is a very portable POSIX/ANSI-C based library for Unix platforms
which provides non-preemptive priority-based scheduling for multiple
threads of execution ("multithreading") inside server applications. All
threads run in the same address space of the server application, but
each thread has it's own individual program-counter, run-time stack,
signal mask and errno variable.
