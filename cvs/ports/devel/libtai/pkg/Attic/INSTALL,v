@initial import of libtai-0.60:
--
libtai is a library for storing and manipulating dates and times.
 
libtai supports two time scales: (1) TAI64, covering a few hundred
billion years with 1-second precision; (2) TAI64NA, covering the
same period with 1-attosecond precision. Both scales are defined
in terms of TAI, the current international real time standard.
