@The Liblouis software suite provides an open-source braille translator,
back-translator and formatter for a large number of languages and
braille codes. It is a set of libraries designed for use in any of a
number of applications, both free and commercial. It is written in C so
that it does not require a runtime environment and hence can be used in
applications written in high-level languages such as Java and Python.
