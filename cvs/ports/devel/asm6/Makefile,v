@import ports/devel/asm6, from Anthony J. Bentley, ok landry@@

Asm6 is another 6502 assembler. It was built to do NES development, but
you can probably use it for just about anything. It was written because
the author thought most other assemblers either were too finicky, had
weird syntax, took too much work to set up, or were too bug-ridden to be
useful.
