@GIT is a "directory content manager" designed to handle absolutely
massive projects with speed and efficiency, and the release of the
2.6.12 (and later) versions of the Linux kernel as well as more and
more other projects switching to it would indicate that it does this
task well.

GIT falls in the category of distributed source code management tools,
similar to e.g. GNU Arch or Monotone (or, in the commercial world,
BitKeeper). Every GIT working directory is a full-fledged repository
with full revision tracking capabilities, not dependent on network
access to a central server.
