1.3
log
@Remove SECURITY files. They have served their purpose in the past but
have become pretty useless nowadays (and the pkg tools do not display
them anyway).
Some which contained valuable information have been turned into READMEs.

Temporary file handling has improved in this version, but still needs
work. It now uses mkstemp(), but because there is no way to create an
ofstream object from a file descriptor there are still race conditions.
Similarly for passing temp file names to gnuplot.

@Fix tmpnam() holes in ddd.
Quick and dirty patches that do the job, a cleaner version
to contribute back to ddd's authors will appear shortly.

There are lots of tmpnam() warnings in ddd.
Most are temporary files that are used locally.
A few are passed off to an external gnuplot process.
Fortunately, gnuplot has no compunction about writing over 
an existing file, so those can be fixed.
