log
@Add ocamlbuild and cppo ports in preparation for Ocaml 4.3.0.

Ocaml 4.3.0 does not supply an internal ocamlbuild, and cppo is
needed by the utop update related to 4.3.0.

Not hooked into build yet.

ok anil@@ sthen@@ so final 4.3.0 polishing can be done in-tree.

text
@Cppo is an equivalent of the C preprocessor targeted at the
OCaml language and its variants.

The main purpose of cppo is to provide a lightweight tool
for simple macro substitution (#define) and file inclusion
(#include) for the occasional case when this is useful in
OCaml. Processing specific sections of files by calling
external programs is also possible via #ext directives.

The implementation of cppo relies on the standard library of
OCaml and on the standard parsing tools Ocamllex and
Ocamlyacc, which contribute to the robustness of cppo across
OCaml versions.
