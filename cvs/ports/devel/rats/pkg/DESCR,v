@This is RATS, a rough auditing tool for security, developed by Secure
Software Solutions. It is a tool for scanning source code (C, C++, Perl,
PHP, Ruby and Python) and flagging common security related programming
errors such as buffer overflows and TOCTOU (Time Of Check, Time Of Use)
race conditions.

As its name implies, the tool performs only a rough analysis of source
code. It will not find every error and will also find things that are
not errors. Manual inspection of your code is still necessary, but
greatly aided with this tool.
