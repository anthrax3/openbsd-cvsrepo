@SDLmm is a C++ glue for SDL, or the Simple DirectMedia
Layer, which is a generic API that provides low level access
to audio, keyboard, mouse, joystick, 3D hardware via OpenGL,
and 2D framebuffer across multiple platforms.

SDLmm aims to stay as close as possible to the C API while
taking advantage of native C++ features like object
orientation.  It also aims at being platform independent
as much as possible.
