log
@Relax some cabal dependency restrictions for hs packages where the
dependencies have been update "online" (i.e. on hackage.haskell.org)
without releaseing a new version of the package. If this sounds
confusing, just compare the .cabal files contained in the distfiles
with the .cabal file you get from hackage.haskell.org.

Dependency changed in the "online" version of the package description,
but not in the dist file.
