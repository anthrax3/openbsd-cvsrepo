@Set IGNORE.  Those modules now come stock with perl-5.8.0 which is part
of -current since a few days ago thanks to millert@@

NOTE: If you are not tracking -current and are using the -current ports
tree this where you will run into trouble as dependencies on these ports
are removed.  For -current users, make sure your system is up-to-date

@Import Perl module Locale::Maketext 1.03.
Submitted by Nikolay Sturm <sturm@@sec.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de>.

Locale::Maketext is a base class providing a framework for localization 
and inheritance-based lexicons, as described in an article in The Perl 
Journal #13.

@Initial import of Locale-Maketext-2.09

It is a common feature of applications (whether run directly, or via the
Web) for them to be "localized" -- i.e., for them to a present an
English interface to an English-speaker, a German interface to a
German-speaker, and so on for all languages it's programmed with.
Locale::Maketext is a framework for software localization; it provides
you with the tools for organizing and accessing the bits of text and
text-processing code that you need for producing localized applications.
