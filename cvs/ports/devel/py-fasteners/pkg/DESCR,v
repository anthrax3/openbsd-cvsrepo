@The fasteners module includes the following:

Locking decorator

    Helpful locked decorator (that acquires instance objects lock(s) and
    acquires on method entry and releases on method exit).

Reader-writer locks

    Multiple readers (at the same time).  Single writers (blocking any
    readers).  Helpful read_locked and write_locked decorators.

Inter-process locks

    Single writer using file based locking (these automatically release
    on process exit, even if __release__ or __exit__ is never called).
    Helpful interprocess_locked decorator.

Generic helpers

    A try_lock helper context manager that will attempt to acquire a
    given lock and provide back whether the attempt passed or failed (if
    it passes, then further code in the context manager will be ran with
    the lock acquired).
