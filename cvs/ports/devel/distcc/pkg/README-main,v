distcc
======
To spawn compilation jobs on remote hosts, a minimal configuration
such as the following can be used as `~/.distcc/hosts`:

    localhost 192.168.178.13

or `/etc/distcc/hosts` for a system-wide configuration.
For SSH connections prefix hosts with `@@` in the host specification.
distcc will run the jobs as the user invoking distcc.

Then set `$CC` to `distcc` to distribute compilation jobs across the
configured nodes.

References
==========
For more information on using distcc and setting up a build cluster, please
refer to the Gentoo and Arch Linux wikis. While containing information
specific to their build systems, they do provide good general information:

USE_DISTCC
==========
To allow building ports with distcc, set `USE_DISTCC=Yes` either in the
environment or in `/etc/mk.conf`. When using `USE_DISTCC` the the `DISTCC_DIR`
is set to ${WRKOBJDIR}/.distcc.

Note that it's currently not (yet) possible to enable both `USE_DISTCC` and
`USE_CCACHE`. Also pumping mode is not setup/enabled at this moment.

To monitor a build be sure to point DISTCC_DIR to the correct directory.

1.1.1.1
log
@import distcc-3.1 (git head)

distcc is a program to distribute compilation of C or C++ code across
several machines on a network. distcc should always generate the same
results as a local compile, is simple to install and use, and is often
two or more times faster than a local compile.
