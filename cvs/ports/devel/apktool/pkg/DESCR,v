@apktool is a tool for reverse engineering 3rd party, closed, binary Android
apps. It can decode resources to nearly original form and rebuild them after
making some modifications; it makes it possible to debug small code step
by step. Also it makes working with apps easier because of a project-like
file structure and automation of some repetitive tasks like building APKs,
etc.
