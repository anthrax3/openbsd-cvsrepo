1.1
log
@Fixes for clang:

Add -fbracket-depth=512 because the preprocessed source exceeds the suggested
implementation limit of 256 for nesting levels of parenthesized expressions
within a full-expression as given in Annex B of the C++ standard.

Add a missing <sys/select.h> that previously must have been pulled in by
another header.
