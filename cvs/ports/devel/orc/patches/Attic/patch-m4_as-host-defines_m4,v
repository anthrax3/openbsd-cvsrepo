@$OpenBSD: patch-m4_as-host-defines_m4,v 1.1 2010/03/25 10:23:26 sthen Exp $

orc's arm support is broken; avoid testing for this so the
generic code is used instead.

@Import devel/orc, from Brad with a patch from me to drop ARM machines
back to the generic support rather than trying to use the asm backend
which appears to be broken upstream.

Orc is a library and set of tools for compiling and executing
very simple programs that operate on arrays of data.  The "language"
is a generic assembly language that represents many of the features
available in SIMD architectures, including saturated addition and
subtraction, and many arithmetic operations.
