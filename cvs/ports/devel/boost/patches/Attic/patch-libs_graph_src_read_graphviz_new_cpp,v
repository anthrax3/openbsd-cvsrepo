1.2
log
@Update to boost 1.42, fixes regressions in gzip module introduced in
1.41. Tested without fallout in a bulk build by stephan@@, thanks!
Endianess fixes from kili@@, mark as NO_REGRESS as regression suite
changed a lot since old previous 1.34 version.
Remove deanna@@ from MAINTAINER has she agreed not having time for it atm.
This port doesn't honour CFLAGS but this will be dealt separately.
