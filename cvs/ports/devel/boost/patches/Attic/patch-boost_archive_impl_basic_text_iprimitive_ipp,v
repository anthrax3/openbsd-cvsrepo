log
@- Remove the now unnecessary patches now the that wide character
  support has been integrated
  - Move the endian setting bits within endian.hpp header up above
    Boost's own set of checks to try and guess the endianness of
      the architecture so that the OpenBSD endian header is actually
	used
	- Sync the Boost.Math patch for enabling the long double support
	  on OpenBSD/hppa with what was submitted upstream and commited.

tested by aja@@ and naddy@@

@Update to boost 1.42, fixes regressions in gzip module introduced in
1.41. Tested without fallout in a bulk build by stephan@@, thanks!
Endianess fixes from kili@@, mark as NO_REGRESS as regression suite
changed a lot since old previous 1.34 version.
Remove deanna@@ from MAINTAINER has she agreed not having time for it atm.
This port doesn't honour CFLAGS but this will be dealt separately.
