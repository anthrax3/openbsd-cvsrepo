@LIBNFS is a client library for accessing NFS shares over a network.

LIBNFS offers three different APIs, for different use :

1, RAW : A fully async low level RPC library for NFS protocols This API is
described in include/libnfs-raw.h it offers a fully async interface to raw XDR
encoded blobs.  This API provides very flexible and precise control of the RPC
issued.

2, NFS ASYNC : A fully asynchronous library for high level vfs functions This
API is described by the *_async() functions in include/libnfs.h.  This API
provides a fully async access to posix vfs like functions such as stat(),
read(), ...

3, NFS SYNC : A synchronous library for high level vfs functions This API is
described by the *_sync() functions in include/libnfs.h.  This API provides
access to posix vfs like functions such as stat(), read(), ...
