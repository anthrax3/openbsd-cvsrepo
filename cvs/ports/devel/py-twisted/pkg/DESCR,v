log
@Belated update to Twisted 17.1.0.

All the hard work by Pavel Korovin (thanks!), who takes maintainership
from eric@@.  The different sub-parts of twisted were all merged in the
same project, ports using it will be adapted shortly.

text
@Twisted is a framework, written in Python, for writing networked applications.
It includes implementations of a number of commonly used network services such
as a web server, an IRC chat server, a mail server, a relational database
interface and an object broker. Developers can build applications using all of
these services as well as custom services that they write themselves. Twisted
also includes a user authentication system that controls access to services
and provides services with user context information to implement their own
security models.
