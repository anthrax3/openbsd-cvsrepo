@Remove www/ruby-rails and dependencies.  The current version is
out of date and subject to serious security vulnerabilities, updating
it causes a lot of ports churn for little benefit, and nobody has
offered to maintain it.

1.1.1.1
log
@PaperTrail lets you track changes to your models' data.  It's good for auditing
or versioning.  You can see how a model looked at any stage in its lifecycle,
revert it to any version, and even undelete it after it's been destroyed.
