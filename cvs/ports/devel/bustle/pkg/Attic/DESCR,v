@Remove devel/bustle. While there actually is a newer version
available that might be buildable with ghc-7.10 and newer
gtk2hs-buildtools, I want to get rid of the latter, and
people could still build it with cabal-install.

@Bustle draws sequence diagrams of D-Bus activity, showing signal
emissions, method calls and their corresponding returns, with timestamps
for each individual event and the duration of each method call. This can
help you check for unwanted D-Bus traffic, and pinpoint why your
D-Bus-based application isn't performing as well as you like.

There are also command-line tools for generating statistics from D-Bus
traces.
