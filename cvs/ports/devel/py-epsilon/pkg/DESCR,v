@Epsilon is a set of utility modules, commonly used by all Divmod projects.

This is intended mainly as a support package for code used by Divmod projects,
and not as an external library.  However, it contains many useful modules and
you can feel free to use them!

Currently included:

  * A powerful date/time formatting and import/export class
    (ExtimeDotTime), for exchanging date and time information between all
    Python's various ways to interpret objects as times or time
    deltas. 
  * Tools for managing concurrent asynchronous processes within
    Twisted. 
  * A metaclass which helps you define classes with explicit states. 
  * A featureful Version class. 
  * A formal system for application of monkey-patches.
