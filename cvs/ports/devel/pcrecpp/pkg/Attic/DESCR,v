@The PCRE library is a set of functions that implement regular expression
pattern matching using the same syntax and semantics as Perl 5. PCRE has
its own native API, as well as a set of wrapper functions that correspond
to the POSIX regular expression API. The PCRE library is free, even for
building commercial software.

This package contains the C++ library.
