1.1
log
@Split gettext into a small runtime component and a separate large
set of development tools as recommended by upstream.

Ports will continue to depend on devel/gettext for libintl.  The
gettext module also provides an automatic build dependency on
devel/gettext-tools for msgfmt etc.

A few ports that require a library provided by gettext-tools get a
corresponding dependency.

Also update gettext to 0.19.5.1.

COMMENT and DESCR from FreeBSD.  Bulk build testing by sthen@@.
