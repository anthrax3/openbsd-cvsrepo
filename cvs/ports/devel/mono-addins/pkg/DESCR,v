@Mono.Addins is a framework for creating extensible applications, and for
creating libraries which extend those applications.  Mono.Addins has
been designed to be easy to use and useful for a wide range of
applications: from simple applications with small extensibility needs,
to complex applications which need support for large add-in structures.

This new framework intends to set an standard for building extensible
applications and add-ins in Mono.
