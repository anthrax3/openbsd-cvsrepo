@The 1.2pre-v2 release of the Blackdown JDK is based on Sun's JDK
1.2.  (As of 29 December 2000, Sun is distributing JDK 1.2.2.)  As
such, it is subject to several security vulnerabilities that we
cannot correct.  More information on those as well as other known
Java vulnerabilities can be found at
