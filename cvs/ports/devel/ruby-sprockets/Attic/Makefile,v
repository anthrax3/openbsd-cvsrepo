@Import ruby-sprockets 2.0.3, a Rails 3.1 dependency

Sprockets is a Ruby library for compiling and serving web assets. It
features declarative dependency management for JavaScript and CSS
assets, as well as a powerful preprocessor pipeline that allows you to
write assets in languages like CoffeeScript, Sass, SCSS and LESS.
