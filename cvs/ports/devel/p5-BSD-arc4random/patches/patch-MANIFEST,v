1.1
log
@The p5-BSD-arc4random port in OpenBSD should keep the API of the
BSD::arc4random Perl module, but use our libc functions internally.
This has been done with arc4random() already, but arc4random_bytes()
and arc4random_uniform() were still using a pure Perl implementation.
Replace that with an XS wrapper to our arc4random_buf(3) and
arc4random_uniform(3) functions in libc.
Take maintainer, most remaining code is in my patches.

The file arc4random.c is removed in post-extract as everything is
implemented in OpenBSD libc.  Avoid a build warning about manifest.
