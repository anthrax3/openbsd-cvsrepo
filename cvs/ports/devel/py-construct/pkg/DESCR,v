@A powerful declarative parser/builder for binary data Construct is a
powerful declarative parser (and builder) for binary data.  Instead of
writing imperative code to parse a piece of data, you declaratively
define a data structure that describes your data. As this data structure
is not code, you can use it in one direction to parse data into Pythonic
objects, and in the other direction, convert (build) objects into
binary data.
