@Set IGNORE.  Those modules now come stock with perl-5.8.0 which is part
of -current since a few days ago thanks to millert@@

NOTE: If you are not tracking -current and are using the -current ports
tree this where you will run into trouble as dependencies on these ports
are removed.  For -current users, make sure your system is up-to-date

perl module replacement for the builtin Scalar
---
This package contains a selection of subroutines that people have
expressed would be nice to have in the perl core, but the usage
would not really be high enough to warrant the use of a keyword,
and the size so small such that being individual extensions would
be wasteful.
