@import p5-Parse-CPAN-Meta

Parse::CPAN::Meta is a parser for META.yml files, based on the parser
half of YAML::Tiny.
It supports a basic subset of the full YAML specification, enough to
implement parsing of typical META.yml files, and other similarly simple
YAML files.
If you need something with more power, move up to a full YAML parser
such as YAML, YAML::Syck or YAML::LibYAML.
