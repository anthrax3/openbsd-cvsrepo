@import devel/kyua-testers, from Sergey Bronnikov, ok shadchin@@ pre-lock, only
minor changes since.

This module, kyua-testers, provides scriptable interfaces to interact
with test programs of various kinds.  The interface of such testers
allows the caller to execute a single test case of a single test program
in a controlled and homogeneous manner.
