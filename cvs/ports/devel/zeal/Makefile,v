0.3.0
=====
This releases contains a lot of bug fixes, as well as improvements to the UI and
application performance. See the link above for the complete list of changes.
The most interesting changes are listed below.

New Features:

    Dedicated docset management UI available via Tools -> Docsets.... (#354)
    Added portable mode support. (#486)

    Added support for system style icons (FreeDesktop) if available.
    A new tab can set to open after currently selected one.

Improvements:

    Added tooltips for elided texts across the app (tabs, search results).
    Page Up/Page Down now work when search text box is focused.
    Splitters and tool bars do not override system styling.
    Splitters cannot be collapsed anymore.
    Updated symbol type icons and definitions.
    Main menu updated to be more browser-like.
    Show current page title in the window title.

    Fixed filename corruption on Windows with non-Latin locale. (#508)
    Fixed docset list not updating on storage change. (#475)

Known Issues:

    Under some circumstances Zeal crashes on exit or start. (#595 and #605 )

    relevant. (#603)
