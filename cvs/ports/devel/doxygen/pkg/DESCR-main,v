@Attempt #2 at handling doxygen on mips64el. Rather than using a FLAVOR,
just set CONFIGURE_ARGS on mips64el, don't provide a way to build with
--english-only on other arch (as the only reason for using this seems to
be to work around compiler/toolchain problems). Avoids oddity with
out-of-date reported by fgsch@@.

Also make sure the arch check is done after including bsd.port.arch.mk;
ARCH was in my environment when I tested before, sigh... this problem
reported by kili@@.

"it's shorter than the previous version, so it's automagically ok" kili@@ ;)

@Doxygen is a documentation system for C++, C, Java, Objective-C, IDL
(Corba and Microsoft flavors) and to some extent PHP, C# and D.

It can generate an on-line documentation browser (in HTML) and/or an
off-line reference manual (in $\mbox{\LaTeX}$ ) from a set of documented
source files. There is also support for generating output in RTF
(MS-Word), PostScript, hyperlinked PDF, compressed HTML, and Unix man
pages. The documentation is extracted directly from the sources, which
makes it much easier to keep the documentation consistent with the
source code.

You can configure doxygen to extract the code structure from
undocumented source files. This is very useful to quickly find your way
in large source distributions. You can also visualize the relations
between the various elements by means of include dependency graphs,
inheritance diagrams, and collaboration diagrams, which are all
generated automatically.

To take full advantage of doxygen's features the following additional
ports should be installed:

 - print/texlive for generating LaTeX, Postscript, and PDF output.
 - math/graphviz for the include dependency graphs, the graphical
   inheritance graphs, and the collaboration graphs.
 - print/ghostscript

Flavors:
        * gui -- build Qt frontend

Note:

When generating certain filenames (for example directory listing with
the html backend), doxygen uses an md5 sum of the source path.  This
is a problem for the ports framework, as the sources location can vary
(/usr/obj/ports/..., usr/ports/.../w-..., /usr/ports/mystuff/.../w-...).

This port has been modified so that when running doxygen, the
DOXYGEN_ENCODE_PATH_STRIP environment variable can be set to a prefix
to be stripped from a path before its md5 sum is calculated.  Ports
using doxygen should use "DOXYGEN_ENCODE_PATH_STRIP=${WRKSRC}".

@Add an english_only flavour (passes --english-only to autoconf to avoid
building support for other languages). Use it on mips64el by default
as ld(1) has trouble without it. Information from Brian Callahan and
Bryan Irvine.

- while there, prefer http MASTER_SITES

@- update to 1.5.4
- use tmake in ports (noticed by okan@@)
- hack to strip a path prefix when generating md5 sum of source dir.
