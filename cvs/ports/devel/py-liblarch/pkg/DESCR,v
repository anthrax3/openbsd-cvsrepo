@Update to py-liblarch-2.1.0.
@
text
@Liblarch is a python library built to easily handle data structure such
are lists, trees and acyclic graphs (tree where nodes can have multiple
parents). There's also a liblarch-gtk binding that will allow you to use
your data structure into a Gtk.Treeview.

Liblarch support multiple views of one data structure and complex
filtering. That way, you have a clear separation between your data
themselves (Model) and how they are displayed (View).

If you find Gtk.Treeview and Gtk.Treemodel hard to use, then liblarch is
probably for you.
