@The binary I/O stream class library presents a platform-independent way
to access binary data streams in C++.

The library is hardware independent in the form that it transparently
converts between the different forms of machine-internal binary data
representation. It further employs no special I/O protocol and can be
used on arbitrary binary data sources.
