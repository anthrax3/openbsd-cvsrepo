1.1.1.1
log
@Import Term::ShellUI 0.92.

Term::ShellUI uses the history and autocompletion features of
Term::ReadLine to present a sophisticated command-line interface to the
user. It tries to make every feature that one would expect to see in a
fully interactive shell trivial to implement. You simply declare your
command set and let ShellUI take care of the heavy lifting.
