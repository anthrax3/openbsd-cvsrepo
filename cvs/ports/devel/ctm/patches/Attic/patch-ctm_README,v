@@@@ -21,7 +21,7 @@@@ CTM is now meant to be the definitive way to make and 
 two versions of a directory tree.
 There are two parts to this, making the delta and applying it.  These are two
 entirely different things.  CTM concentrates the computation-burden on the
-generation og the deltas, as a delta very often is applied more times than
+generation of the deltas, as a delta very often is applied more times than
 it is made.  Second CTM tries to make the minimal size delta.
 
 Why not use diff/patch ?
@@@@ -55,7 +55,7 @@@@ You pass it to the 'ctm' command.  You can pass a CTM-
 you can give the filename as an argument.  If you do the latter, you make
 life a lot easier for your self, since the program can accept gzip'ed files
 and since it will not have to make a temporary copy of your file.  You can
-specify multiple deltas at one time, they will be proccessed one at a time.
+specify multiple deltas at one time, they will be processed one at a time.
 
 The ctm command runs in a number of passes.  It will process the entire
 input file in each pass, before commencing with the next pass.
