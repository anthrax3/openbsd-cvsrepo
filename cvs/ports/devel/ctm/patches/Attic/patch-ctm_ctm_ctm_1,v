-.Nm Ctm

 was originally
 .Dq Cvs Through eMail ,
 but now instead it seems more fitting to call it
 .Dq Current Through eMail .
-

 is now meant to be the definitive way to make and apply a delta between
 two versions of a directory tree.

+There are two parts to this, making the delta and applying it.
+These are two
 entirely different things.
-
 .Ss Usage
-
 To apply a CTM delta, you pass it to the
-.Nm ctm
-command.  You can pass a CTM delta on stdin, or you can give the
-filename as an argument.  If you do the latter, you make life a lot
-easier for your self, since the program can accept gzip'ed files and
-since it will not have to make a temporary copy of your file.  You can
-specify multiple deltas at one time, they will be proccessed one at a
-time.  Deltas that are already applied will be ignored.

+You can pass a CTM delta on stdin, or you can give the
+filename as an argument.
+If you do the latter, you make life a lot
+easier for yourself, since the program can accept gzip'ed files and
+since it will not have to make a temporary copy of your file.
+You can
+specify multiple deltas at one time, they will be processed one at a
+time.
+Deltas that are already applied will be ignored.
+.Pp
 The

+It will process the entire
 input file in each pass, before commencing with the next pass.
-
-Before working one a file
+.Pp
+Before working on a file
 .Ar name
-.Nm ctm
+.Nm
 first checks for the existence of the file
 .Ar name.ctm .
 If this file exists,
-.Nm ctm
+.Nm
 works on it instead.
-
-Pass 1 will validate that the input file is OK.  The syntax, the data
-and the global MD5 checksum will be checked.  If any of these fail,
-.Nm ctm
-will never be able to do anything with the file, so it will simply
-reject it.
-
+.Pp
+Pass 1 will verify that the input file is OK.
+The syntax, the data
+and the global MD5 checksum will be checked.
+If any of these fail,
+.Nm
+will simply reject the input file.
+.Pp
 Pass 2 will validate that the directory tree is in the state expected by
-the CTM delta.  This is done by looking for files and directories which
-should/should not exists and by checking the MD5 checksums of files.  
-
-Pass 3 will actually apply the delta.
-
-.Nm Ctm
-will extract the file hierarchy below its working directory.  Absolute
-filenames or filenames containing references through
-.Sq \&.
+the CTM delta.
+This is done by looking for files and directories which
+should/should not exist and by checking the MD5 checksums of files.
+.Pp
+If a
+.Ar backup-file
+had been specified using the 
+.Fl B
+option, all files that would be modified by this 
+.Nm
+invocation are backed up
+to this file using the archiver command specified by the 
+.Fl t
+option.  The default archiver command is
+.Nm "tar -rf %s -T -" .
+.Pp
+Pass 3 will actually apply the delta. 
+.Pp
+The list of files that would be modified by
+.Nm
+is subject to filtering regular expressions specified
+using the
+.Fl e
 and
-.Sq \&.\&.
+.Fl x
+options.
+The
+.Fl e
+and 
+.Fl x
+options are applied in order of appearance on the command line.
+The last
+filter that matched a given file name determines whether the file would be 
+operated on or left alone by
+.Nm ctm .
+.Pp
+.Nm
+will extract the file hierarchy below its working directory.
+Absolute
+filenames or filenames containing references through
+.Dq \&.
+or
+.Dq \&.\&.
 are explicitly prohibited as a security measure.

+.Bl -tag -width indent
 .It Fl b Ar basedir
 Prepend the path
 .Ar basedir
-on every filename.
-
+to every filename.
+.It Fl B Ar backup-file
+Backup all files that would be modified by this CTM run to
+.Ar backup-file .
+If any filters are specified using the
+.Fl e
+and
+.Fl x
+options, then the final set of files backed up are those that would be
+modified by CTM after the filters are applied.
 .It Fl c
 Check it out, don't do anything.
-
+.It Fl e Ar regular_expression
+Match each name in the CTM file against
+.Ar regular_expression ,
+and if it matches process the file, otherwise leave it alone.
+There may be
+any number of these options.
+Use of this option disables the
+.Pa .ctm_status
+sequence number checks.
+For example, the expression 
+.Ic ^usr.sbin/ctm 
+for example, will select the
+.Pa usr.sbin/ctm
+source directory and all pathnames under it. 
+.Pp
+Pathnames can be disabled from being considered by CTM using the 
+.Fl x
+option.
 .It Fl F

-
-.It Fl p
-Less paranoid.
-
-.It Fl P
-Paranoid.
-
+.It Fl k
+Keep files and directories and don't remove them even if the CTM file
+specifies they are to be removed.
+If the
+.Fl B
+option is specified, these files and directories will not be backed up.
+.It Fl l
+List files that would be modified by this invocation of CTM and the
+actions that would be performed on them.
+Use of the
+.Fl l
+option disables the
+.Pa .ctm_status
+checks and integrity checks on the source tree being operated on.
+The
+.Fl l
+option can be combined with the 
+.Fl e
+and
+.Fl x
+options to determine which files would be modified by the given set of
+command line options.
 .It Fl q
 Tell us less.
-
+.It Fl t Ar tar-command
+Use
+.Ar tar-command
+instead of the default archiver
+.Nm tar .
+This option takes effect only if a backup file had been specified using the
+.Fl B
+option.
+A %s in the tar command will be replaced by the name of the backup 
+file.
 .It Fl T Ar tmpdir
 Put temporary files under
 .Ar tmpdir .
-
 .It Fl u

 creation time.
-
 .It Fl v

-.Ar Level
+.Ar level
 is the level of verbosity.
-
+.It Fl x Ar regular_expression
+Match each name in the CTM file against
+.Ar regular_expression
+and if it matches, leave the file alone.
+There may be any number of these
+options.  Use of this option disables the
+.Pa .ctm_status

+.Pp
+Pathnames can be selected for CTM's consideration using the
+.Fl e
+option.

+.Nm
+to use that pathname
+as the location of temporary file.
