1.3
log
@REVISION bump all ruby ports due to a change in the pkgspec.
Previously, we were using ruby->=1.8,<=1.9, instead of
ruby->=1.8,<1.9.  While this wouldn't cause an issue, since
our ruby-1.9.2 package isn't included in ruby->=1.8,<=1.9,
it's still wrong and should be fixed.  This also fixes the
following minor issues:

Switch from using FLAVOR to MODRUBY_FLAVOR for *_DEPENDS.
Currently we don't have a ruby port that uses FLAVORs that
would differ from MODRUBY_FLAVOR, but it's possible we will
in the future.

Switch from BASE_PKGPATH to BUILD_PKGPATH in a few cases in
REGRESS_DEPENDS.  This probably is not strictly necessary, but
BUILD_PKGPATH is used in more cases, so it is good for
consistency.

Switch to new style *_DEPENDS, with the version specification
at the end.  The remaining cases where this is not done is
because a specific version is used.

Some FULLPKGNAME added to REGRESS_DEPENDS, to make sure that if
the old version is installed when you run a regress test, it
will install the new version first.

Some conversion of spaces to tabs for consistency.

@REVISION bumps for most ruby ports after the ruby.port.mk update.

PKG_ARCH = * removed from many ports as it is added automatically
for pure ruby gem ports.  Switch ports that previously used
GEM_SKIPDEPENDS to adding dependencies or modifying the underlying
gem metadata with patches.

@import ruby-tilt 1.1

Tilt is a thin interface over a bunch of different Ruby template engines
in an attempt to make their usage as generic possible. This is useful
for web frameworks, static site generators, and other systems that
support multiple template engines but don't want to code for each of
them individually.
