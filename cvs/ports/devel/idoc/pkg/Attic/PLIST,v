@Import idoc-0.2.6, a minimalist documentation tool for Haskell

   "IDoc extracts interface documentation and declarations from
    Haskell modules based on standard Haskell layout rules and a
    small number of clues that the programmer embeds in
    interface comments. These clues have been designed to be
    visually non-imposing when displaying the source in a text
    editor.  Interface documentation is rendered in standard
    markup languages (currently, only HTML is supported).  IDoc
    has been designed to be simple to use and install."

IDoc has an advantage over other interface doc tools (like
haddock) in that it is pure Haskell98, and builds with both
ghc and nhc98, making it far more portable.
