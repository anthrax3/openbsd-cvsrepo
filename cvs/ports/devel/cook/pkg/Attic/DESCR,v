@Delete devel/cook because as naddy@@ put it:
"It seems like abandonware, isn't used by anything, and has proven
an active hindrance to moving on with the ports tree.  Easy choice."
The hindrance is that it uses roff(7) .so in such a weird way
that getting rid of USE_GROFF would have been quite tedious.
Greg Steuck (MAINTAINER), naddy@@, and jasper@@ agree with deleting it.

@'cook' serves the same purpose as make(1), but uses a much more sane syntax,
and includes additional features that make it powerful enough to maintain a
single dependency graph for large projects (as things should be done in an
ideal world).  Don't be put off by 'cook' not being commonly available on
target machines, since 'cook' can automatically generate shell scripts that
make installing 'cook' on target machines unnecessary.

@Initial import of cook version 2.15.
cook likes make,  but more powerful and clean.
