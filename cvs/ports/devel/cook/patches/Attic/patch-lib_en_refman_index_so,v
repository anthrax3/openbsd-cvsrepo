@Delete devel/cook because as naddy@@ put it:
"It seems like abandonware, isn't used by anything, and has proven
an active hindrance to moving on with the ports tree.  Easy choice."
The hindrance is that it uses roff(7) .so in such a weird way
that getting rid of USE_GROFF would have been quite tedious.
Greg Steuck (MAINTAINER), naddy@@, and jasper@@ agree with deleting it.
