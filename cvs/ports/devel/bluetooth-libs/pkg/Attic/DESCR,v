@bluetooth on openbsd isn't really a moving target anymore with active
maintainers; and these ports were just rotting away. so move them to the
attic.

@The bluetooth-libs package consists of a few Bluetooth network libraries
derived from NetBSD, and originally from FreeBSD.

libbluetooth provides a set of common routines to be used in the
Bluetooth network applications similar to the libc network routines like
gethostbyname(3).

libsdp provides a set of routines that deal with the Bluetooth Service
Discovery Protocol.

@Update devel/bluetooth-libs and net/bluetooth-tools to match the kernel

This time, the userland tools and libraries are being ported from NetBSD
(which in turn is also based on FreeBSD code).  Both packages represent
work in progress and are not fully functional yet.

ok jasper@@ for the new ports, grange@@ for taking over maintainership
