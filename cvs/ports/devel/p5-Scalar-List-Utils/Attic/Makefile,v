@Import p5-Scalar-List-Utils 1.0701; submitted by Jim Geovedi <jim@@corebsd.or.id>

This package contains a selection of subroutines that people have
expressed would be nice to have in the perl core, but the usage
would not really be high enough to warrant the use of a keyword,
and the size so small such that being individual extensions would
be wasteful.
