@Update to LLVM 3.7.1.  This version is modified to use C++ includes from
ports GCC and link to libestdc++.

Currently, this still breaks mail/mozilla-thunderbird, which will be taken care
of shortly.

feedback/testing from jsg landry mmcc semarie aja naddy (hope I didn't forget
anyone)

The last step of _mm_cvtps_pi16 should use _mm_packs_pi32, which is a function
that reads two __m64 values and packs four 32-bit values into four 16-bit
values.

@Some fixes from uptream..

- Use dwarf-2 by default on OpenBSD and FreeBSD.
- Make VSELECT selection terminate in cases where the condition type has
  to be split and the result type widened.
  (fixes an OOM crash with the vectorizer on i386 if not utilizing SSE2
   or newer)
- The last step of _mm_cvtps_pi16 should use _mm_packs_pi32, which is a
  function that reads two __m64 values and packs four 32-bit values into
  four 16-bit values.

Fix profiling..

- Alias the command line parameter -p to -pg.
