@Update to LLVM 3.7.1.  This version is modified to use C++ includes from
ports GCC and link to libestdc++.

Currently, this still breaks mail/mozilla-thunderbird, which will be taken care
of shortly.

feedback/testing from jsg landry mmcc semarie aja naddy (hope I didn't forget
anyone)

[PowerPC] 32-bit ELF PIC support

This adds initial support for PPC32 ELF PIC (Position Independent Code; the
-fPIC variety), thus rectifying a long-standing deficiency in the PowerPC
backend.

Don't use 128bit functions on PPC32.

This adds initial support for PPC32 ELF PIC (Position Independent Code; the
