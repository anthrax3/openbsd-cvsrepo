@Update to LLVM 3.7.1.  This version is modified to use C++ includes from
ports GCC and link to libestdc++.

Currently, this still breaks mail/mozilla-thunderbird, which will be taken care
of shortly.

feedback/testing from jsg landry mmcc semarie aja naddy (hope I didn't forget
anyone)

ok landry robert

r221709  
Totally forget deallocated SDNodes in SDDbgInfo.

What would happen before that commit is that the SDDbgValues associated with
a deallocated SDNode would be marked Invalidated, but SDDbgInfo would keep
a map entry keyed by the SDNode pointer pointing to this list of invalidated
SDDbgNodes. As the memory gets reused, the list might get wrongly associated
with another new SDNode. As the SDDbgValues are cloned when they are transfered,
this can lead to an exponential number of SDDbgValues being produced during
DAGCombine like in http://llvm.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=20893

Note that the previous behavior wasn't really buggy as the invalidation made
sure that the SDDbgValues won't be used. This commit can be considered a
memory optimization and as such is really hard to validate in a unit-test.
