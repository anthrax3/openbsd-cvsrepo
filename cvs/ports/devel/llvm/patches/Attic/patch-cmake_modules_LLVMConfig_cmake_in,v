@- Remove MAKE_FLAGS variables as they were only relevant for the GNU autoconf/make
  build infrastructure
- Remove the CMake patch as sebastia@@ says it did not actually work and should be
  removed
- Some frontend driver tweaks for the external assembler handling for 32-bit mode
  (-m32) on amd64, powerpc handling and bring the ABI determination bits in line
  with the other OS's to use the getGnuCompatibleMipsABIName function
