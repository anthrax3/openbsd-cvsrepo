@Update to LLVM 3.7.1.  This version is modified to use C++ includes from
ports GCC and link to libestdc++.

Currently, this still breaks mail/mozilla-thunderbird, which will be taken care
of shortly.

feedback/testing from jsg landry mmcc semarie aja naddy (hope I didn't forget

@- Remove a local PowerPC patch we don't need.
- A fix for the SPARC float handling. Adding the missing & to the field allows
  the backend feature flag to be passed back which it was not without it.
- Add some patches to enable the integrated assembler on PowerPC / SPARC.
  I left these out before as I thought because Clang was not obeying this
  setting and had its own similar bits they were not necessary but turns
  out the backend has some code that does obey this setting.
