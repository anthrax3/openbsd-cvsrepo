@Coccinelle is a program matching and transformation engine which
provides the language SmPL (Semantic Patch Language) for specifying
desired matches and transformations in C code.

Coccinelle was initially targeted towards performing collateral
evolutions in Linux. Such evolutions comprise the changes that are
needed in client code in response to evolutions in library APIs, and may
include modifications such as renaming a function, adding a function
argument whose value is somehow context-dependent, and reorganizing a
data structure.

Beyond collateral evolutions, Coccinelle is successfully used (by INRIA
and others) for finding and fixing bugs in systems code.
