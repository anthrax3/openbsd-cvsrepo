XXX THIS IS A HACK
Make this error non-fatal by not exiting. This is needed to workaround
the effects of userland threads which change i/o operations to
non-blocking.

log
@XXX THIS IS A HACK
Make an error non-fatal in close_stdout() by not exiting. This is needed
to workaround the effects of userland threads which change i/o
operations to non-blocking.

This prevents the 'write errors' people have been seeing with gmake.
