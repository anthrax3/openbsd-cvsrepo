@Remove devel/hs-hoogle.

While it *is* useful, you can build it yourself using cabal-install, and
an update of the port would require dozens of updates and additions of
os-distribution-hostile micro libraries. I'm not going to maintain such
a madness.

@Hoogle is a Haskell API search engine, which allows you to search
many standard Haskell libraries by either function name, or by
approximate type signature.

There are still a lot of things left to improve for this port:

- Privilege dropping when running the server as root (difficult,
  because this should be better done in hs-warp). To be worked on
  with upstream.

- Add an rc.d script for the server.

- Remove unneded files after running "hoogle data ...". To be worked
  on with upstream.

- Integrate with our own hs-packages (so you can search in installed
  libraries only).

- Add usable documentation. To be done with upstream (currently,
  there's only some Wiki page).

- Use our ftp(1) instead of wget(1). (IIRC, the hoogle API contains
  some functions which pass options verbatim to wget(1), so this
  may be difficult to get right).
