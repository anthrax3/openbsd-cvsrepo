QBS is a tool that helps simplify the build process for developing projects
across multiple platforms. QBS can be used for any software project, regardless
of programming language, toolkit, or libraries used.

QBS is an all-in-one tool that generates a build graph from a high-level project
description (like qmake or CMake) and additionally undertakes the task
of executing the commands in the low-level build graph (like make).

Most of the work was done by zhuk@@ Thanks!. Makefile cleanup and fix/enable
tests by me.

conflict tweak and ok jca@@
