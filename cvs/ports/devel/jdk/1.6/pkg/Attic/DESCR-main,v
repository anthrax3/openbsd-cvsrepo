@Java (TM) 2 SDK, Standard Edition
Version 1.6.0

The Java 2 SDK software includes tools useful for developing and
testing programs written in the Java programming language and
running on the Java platform.

Flavors:
  native_bootstrap
    Bootstrap the jdk using a previously built and installed
    devel/jdk/1.6 package.

  with_ipv6
    Build the jdk/jre with ipv6 support. When the jdk/jre is built
    with this flavor, java will create only ipv6 sockets by default.
    Since ipv4 to ipv6 address mapping is disabled on OpenBSD,
    using ipv4 addresses will fail. Consequently, you may only
    use ipv6 addresses or you can start java with
    -Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true and can only use ipv4
    addresses.

@- Update to openjdk6 u32 which is licensed under the GPL and allows
  packages.
- Initial BSD patchset from FreeBSD openjdk6 port.
- New bootstrap method. Since ecj is not able to bootstrap openjdk6
  without heavy patching, use a functional bootjdk to build.
- Add a target for building the bootjdk called build-bootjdk.
- Apply IcedTea AppletHole patches for icedtea-web support.
- Backport patch to serialize gconf client access which corrects
  gconf/dbus related crashes. From Christian Schulte Upstream
  CR 7188755.
- Reapply audio support from jakemsr@@.
- Port change for CWM. Recognize CWM as a Non-Reparenting window
  manager.
- Backport various openjdk7/bsd-port upstream fixes both specific
  to OpenBSD and general.
Tested by landry@@ espie@@ and others.

    previously installed devel/jdk/1.6 package, the port will
    just build the jdk with default (devel/jdk/1.5) bootstrap and stop.

@Initial import of Java (TM) 2 SDK, Standard Edition Version 1.6.0 with
amd64 plugin support. 64-bit plugin hacking by myself and Jung-uk Kim.
Credit for the majority of the 1.6 BSD porting goes to Greg Lewis who
back ported my 1.7 hotspot patches to 1.6 and forward ported the 1.5
j2se patches to 1.6. Thanks to several testers who provided helpful
feedback. okay ian@@
