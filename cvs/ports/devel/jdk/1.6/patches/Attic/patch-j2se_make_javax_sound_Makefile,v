1.2
log
@- Update to openjdk6 u32 which is licensed under the GPL and allows
  packages.
- Initial BSD patchset from FreeBSD openjdk6 port.
- New bootstrap method. Since ecj is not able to bootstrap openjdk6
  without heavy patching, use a functional bootjdk to build.
- Add a target for building the bootjdk called build-bootjdk.
- Apply IcedTea AppletHole patches for icedtea-web support.
- Backport patch to serialize gconf client access which corrects
  gconf/dbus related crashes. From Christian Schulte Upstream
  CR 7188755.
- Reapply audio support from jakemsr@@.
- Port change for CWM. Recognize CWM as a Non-Reparenting window
  manager.
- Backport various openjdk7/bsd-port upstream fixes both specific
  to OpenBSD and general.
Tested by landry@@ espie@@ and others.

1.1
log
@sndio support.  note, there are two different audio API APIs in jdk1.6,
one, HAE, is not portable to APIs that don't use file descriptors as
their handle, so it's still using ossaudio.  the other, DirectAudio,
is more portable, and is the one that this commit is converting to
sndio.  DirectAudio is preferred by jdk, and if it's supported, it will
be used.  in other words, your java apps on OpenBSD will now be using
sndio (assuing you're using jdk1.6, sndio for jdk1.7 coming soon).
just wanted to explain why this still links with libossaudio ...
