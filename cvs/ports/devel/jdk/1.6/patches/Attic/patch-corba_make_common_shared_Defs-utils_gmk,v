1.1
log
@- Update to openjdk6 u32 which is licensed under the GPL and allows
  packages.
- Initial BSD patchset from FreeBSD openjdk6 port.
- New bootstrap method. Since ecj is not able to bootstrap openjdk6
  without heavy patching, use a functional bootjdk to build.
- Add a target for building the bootjdk called build-bootjdk.
- Apply IcedTea AppletHole patches for icedtea-web support.
- Backport patch to serialize gconf client access which corrects
  gconf/dbus related crashes. From Christian Schulte Upstream
  CR 7188755.
- Reapply audio support from jakemsr@@.
- Port change for CWM. Recognize CWM as a Non-Reparenting window
  manager.
- Backport various openjdk7/bsd-port upstream fixes both specific
  to OpenBSD and general.
Tested by landry@@ espie@@ and others.
