@Java (TM) 2 SDK, Standard Edition
Version 1.5.0

The Java 2 SDK software includes tools useful for developing and
testing programs written in the Java programming language and
running on the Java platform.

Flavors:
  native_bootstrap
    Bootstrap the jdk using a previously built and installed
    devel/jdk/1.5 package.

  no_web
    The Mozilla plugin and Java Web Start (javaws) are not built.
    NOTE: The plugin is not working on amd64.

  with_ipv6
    Build the jdk/jre with ipv6 support. When the jdk/jre is built
    with this flavor, java will create only ipv6 sockets by default.
    Since ipv4 to ipv6 address mapping is disabled on OpenBSD,
    using ipv4 addresses will fail. Consequently, you may only
    use ipv6 addresses or you can start java with
    -Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true and can only use ipv4
    addresses.

@- update to BSD patchset 7 based off Sun's JRL licensed Update 13 source:
http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/ReleaseNotes.html#150_13
- Do a better job respecting Sun's JRL license by using interactive
  license verification, installing the correct license and include a
  license blurb in the pkg MESSAGEs. (Interactive license verification
  script from FreeBSD/Greg Lewis)
- fix a packing problem with the no_web FLAVOR.

NOTE: This port is now IS_INTERACTIVE=Yes. After agreeing to the JRL
license, users can put ACCEPT_JRL_LICENSE=Yes into /etc/mk.conf to
automatically accept the license and make the port IS_INTERACTIVE=No.
Bulk builders will need to do this so things like OpenOffice get built.

    devel/jdk/1.5 package. NOTE: if this flavor is used without a
    previously installed devel/jdk/1.5 package, the port will
    just build the jdk with default (kaffe) bootstrap and stop.
