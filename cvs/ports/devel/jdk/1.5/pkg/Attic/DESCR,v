@Java (TM) 2 SDK, Standard Edition
Version 1.5.0

The Java 2 SDK software includes tools useful for developing and
testing programs written in the Java programming language and
running on the Java platform.

Flavors:
  native_bootstrap
    Bootstrap the jdk using a previously built and installed
    devel/jdk/1.5 package. NOTE: if this flavor is used without a
    previously installed devel/jdk/1.5 package, the port will
    build the jdk twice!

  no_web
    The Mozilla plugin and Java Web Start (javaws) are not built.
    NOTE: The plugin is not working on amd64.

  with_ipv6
    Build the jdk/jre with ipv6 support. When the jdk/jre is built
    with this flavor, java will create only ipv6 sockets by default.
    Since ipv4 to ipv6 address mapping is disabled on OpenBSD,
    using ipv4 addresses will fail. Consequently, you may only
    use ipv6 addresses or you can start java with
    -Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true and can only use ipv4
    addresses.

log
@Enable JDK/JRE build on amd64. Switch to bootstrapping using Kaffe + Solaris JDK binary,
obviating need to build with JDK Linux compat (which was i386 only anyway).
Add native_bootstrap pseudo-flavor so you can build with a native Sun JDK if you
have one (tested by building this way using JDK built with default Kaffe-based build).
Work by kurt@@, tested by him on i386 and me on amd64. OK kurt@@.

@- add a new pseudo flavor called alt_bootstrap which uses kaffe, Xalan and
solaris class files to bootstrap the jdk build. this avoids the need for
devel/jdk/1.4 to bootstrap and will provide a way to bootstrap the jdk on
amd64 and sparc64 when kaffe runs there.
- fix a keyboard entry problem when numlock is on
- fixup socket option code similar to FreeBSD & NetBSD

  alt_bootstrap
    Bootstrap the jdk using kaffe, Xalan and solaris class files.
    This method avoids the need for having devel/jdk/1.4 as a
    build depend.

@- add plugin and javaws support. disable with no_web flavor.
Demos all work but deadlocking the vm under load has been
noted. Both MToolkit and XToolkit work ok so far.
- fix segfault with MToolkit where processTree was called
with to==NULL.
- fix NPE in plugin paintGrayBox where g==null
- fix javaws startup (from FreeBSD)
- forgot to mention in last commit: Forte Peformance Tools
collector is no longer disabled.
