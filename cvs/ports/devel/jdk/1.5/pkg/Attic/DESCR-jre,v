@Java (TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition
Version 1.5.0

The Java(TM) 2 Runtime Environment contains the Java virtual machine,
runtime class libraries, and Java application launcher that are
necessary to run programs written in the Java programming language.
It is not a development environment and does not contain development
tools such as compilers and debuggers.  For development tools, use
the Java 2 SDK, Standard Edition. 

Flavors:
  native_bootstrap
    Bootstrap the jdk using a previously built and installed
    devel/jdk/1.5 package.

  no_web
    The Mozilla plugin and Java Web Start (javaws) are not built.
    NOTE: The plugin is not working on amd64.

  with_ipv6
    Build the jdk/jre with ipv6 support. When the jdk/jre is built
    with this flavor, java will create only ipv6 sockets by default.
    Since ipv4 to ipv6 address mapping is disabled on OpenBSD,
    using ipv4 addresses will fail. Consequently, you may only
    use ipv6 addresses or you can start java with
    -Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true and can only use ipv4
    addresses.

@- update to BSD patchset 7 based off Sun's JRL licensed Update 13 source:
http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/ReleaseNotes.html#150_13
- Do a better job respecting Sun's JRL license by using interactive
  license verification, installing the correct license and include a
  license blurb in the pkg MESSAGEs. (Interactive license verification
  script from FreeBSD/Greg Lewis)
- fix a packing problem with the no_web FLAVOR.

NOTE: This port is now IS_INTERACTIVE=Yes. After agreeing to the JRL
license, users can put ACCEPT_JRL_LICENSE=Yes into /etc/mk.conf to
automatically accept the license and make the port IS_INTERACTIVE=No.
Bulk builders will need to do this so things like OpenOffice get built.

    previously installed devel/jdk/1.5 package, the port will
    just build the jdk with default (kaffe) bootstrap and stop.

@Enable JDK/JRE build on amd64. Switch to bootstrapping using Kaffe + Solaris JDK binary,
obviating need to build with JDK Linux compat (which was i386 only anyway).
Add native_bootstrap pseudo-flavor so you can build with a native Sun JDK if you
have one (tested by building this way using JDK built with default Kaffe-based build).
Work by kurt@@, tested by him on i386 and me on amd64. OK kurt@@.

@- add a new pseudo flavor called alt_bootstrap which uses kaffe, Xalan and
solaris class files to bootstrap the jdk build. this avoids the need for
devel/jdk/1.4 to bootstrap and will provide a way to bootstrap the jdk on
amd64 and sparc64 when kaffe runs there.
- fix a keyboard entry problem when numlock is on
- fixup socket option code similar to FreeBSD & NetBSD

Demos all work but deadlocking the vm under load has been
