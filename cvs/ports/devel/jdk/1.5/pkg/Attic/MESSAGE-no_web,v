1.1
log
@- update to BSD patchset 7 based off Sun's JRL licensed Update 13 source:
http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/ReleaseNotes.html#150_13
- Do a better job respecting Sun's JRL license by using interactive
  license verification, installing the correct license and include a
  license blurb in the pkg MESSAGEs. (Interactive license verification
  script from FreeBSD/Greg Lewis)
- fix a packing problem with the no_web FLAVOR.

NOTE: This port is now IS_INTERACTIVE=Yes. After agreeing to the JRL
license, users can put ACCEPT_JRL_LICENSE=Yes into /etc/mk.conf to
automatically accept the license and make the port IS_INTERACTIVE=No.
Bulk builders will need to do this so things like OpenOffice get built.
