@- add plugin and javaws support. disable with no_web flavor.
Demos all work but deadlocking the vm under load has been
noted. Both MToolkit and XToolkit work ok so far.
- fix segfault with MToolkit where processTree was called
with to==NULL.
- fix NPE in plugin paintGrayBox where g==null
- fix javaws startup (from FreeBSD)
- forgot to mention in last commit: Forte Peformance Tools
collector is no longer disabled.
