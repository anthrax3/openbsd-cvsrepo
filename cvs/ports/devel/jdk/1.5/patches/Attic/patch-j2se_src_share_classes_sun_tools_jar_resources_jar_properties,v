@- Ensure that when files are extracted that their fully resolved path lies
  in or below the current working directory.  Fixes a security problem with
  jar. From FreeBSD.
- Fix timezone issues. Allow /etc/localtime to be a symlink and fix the case
  where /etc/localtime points to a tz that the jdk doesn't know about.
- timezone is a function on BSD, not a variable, so move the timezone
  == 0 check to the non-BSD section. from millert@@
