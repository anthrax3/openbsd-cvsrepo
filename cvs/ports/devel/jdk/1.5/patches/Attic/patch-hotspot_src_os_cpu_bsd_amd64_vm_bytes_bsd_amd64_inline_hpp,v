@Update to patchset 4 which includes a security fix for CVE-2007-0243

Buffer overflow allows applets to gain privileges via a GIF image with a
block with a 0 width field, which triggers memory corruption and possible
execution of arbitrary code.

Also included in patchset 4 are corrections for building the jdk on amd64
systems with 4G+ memory and the inclusion of the mozilla headers needed to
build the plugin without an external dependency on the old mozilla suite.

@Enable JDK/JRE build on amd64. Switch to bootstrapping using Kaffe + Solaris JDK binary,
obviating need to build with JDK Linux compat (which was i386 only anyway).
Add native_bootstrap pseudo-flavor so you can build with a native Sun JDK if you
have one (tested by building this way using JDK built with default Kaffe-based build).
Work by kurt@@, tested by him on i386 and me on amd64. OK kurt@@.
