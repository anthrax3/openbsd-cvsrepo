1.1
log
@- update port to be based of Sun's 1.5.0 Update 11 src which includes many
bug fixes since the initial release of the 1.5 jdk. I'm sure some of the
fixes are security related but I wasn't able to find a concise list. All
the bugs fixes listed here from update 11 and lower should be fixed by
this update: http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/ReleaseNotes.html#150_11
- NOTE: License change: used to be SCSL, now is JRL (Java Research
License). Still no packages with this license but at least we get the bug
fixes and security fixes now: https://tiger.dev.java.net/
- enable version scripts on libjvm which fixes a symbol conflict with
recent xulrunner which is used by eclipse's internal swt-browser.
