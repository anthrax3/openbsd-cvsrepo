1.1
log
@- add plugin and javaws support. disable with no_web flavor.
Demos all work but deadlocking the vm under load has been
noted. Both MToolkit and XToolkit work ok so far.
- fix segfault with MToolkit where processTree was called
with to==NULL.
- fix NPE in plugin paintGrayBox where g==null
- fix javaws startup (from FreeBSD)
- forgot to mention in last commit: Forte Peformance Tools
collector is no longer disabled.

1.1.2.1
log
@Update to patchset 4 which includes a security fix for CVE-2007-0243

Buffer overflow allows applets to gain privileges via a GIF image with a
block with a 0 width field, which triggers memory corruption and possible
execution of arbitrary code.

Also included in patchset 4 are corrections for building the jdk on amd64
systems with 4G+ memory and the inclusion of the mozilla headers needed to
build the plugin without an external dependency on the old mozilla suite.
