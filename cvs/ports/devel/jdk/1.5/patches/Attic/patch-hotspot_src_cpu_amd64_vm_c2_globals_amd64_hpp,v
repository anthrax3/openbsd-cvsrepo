@- update port to be based of Sun's 1.5.0 Update 11 src which includes many
bug fixes since the initial release of the 1.5 jdk. I'm sure some of the
fixes are security related but I wasn't able to find a concise list. All
the bugs fixes listed here from update 11 and lower should be fixed by
this update: http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/ReleaseNotes.html#150_11
- NOTE: License change: used to be SCSL, now is JRL (Java Research
License). Still no packages with this license but at least we get the bug
fixes and security fixes now: https://tiger.dev.java.net/
- enable version scripts on libjvm which fixes a symbol conflict with
recent xulrunner which is used by eclipse's internal swt-browser.

@- fix the build for good on systems with >= 4G memory by limiting
the jdk's view of physical memory to datasize rlimit max
- remove and adjust old memory adjustments for OpenBSD
- shrink overhead on amd64 making more memory available for use

@Update to patchset 4 which includes a security fix for CVE-2007-0243

Buffer overflow allows applets to gain privileges via a GIF image with a
block with a 0 width field, which triggers memory corruption and possible
execution of arbitrary code.

Also included in patchset 4 are corrections for building the jdk on amd64
systems with 4G+ memory and the inclusion of the mozilla headers needed to
build the plugin without an external dependency on the old mozilla suite.

@Enable JDK/JRE build on amd64. Switch to bootstrapping using Kaffe + Solaris JDK binary,
obviating need to build with JDK Linux compat (which was i386 only anyway).
Add native_bootstrap pseudo-flavor so you can build with a native Sun JDK if you
have one (tested by building this way using JDK built with default Kaffe-based build).
Work by kurt@@, tested by him on i386 and me on amd64. OK kurt@@.
