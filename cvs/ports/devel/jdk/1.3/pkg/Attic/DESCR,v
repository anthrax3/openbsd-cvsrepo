@Java (TM) 2 SDK, Standard Edition
Version 1.3.1

The Java 2 SDK software includes tools useful for developing and 
testing programs written in the Java programming language and
running on the Java platform.  These tools are designed to be 
used from the command line.  Except for the appletviewer, these
tools do not provide a graphical user interface.

Flavors:
  native_bootstrap
    Bootstrap the jdk using a previously built and installed           
    devel/jdk/1.3 package. NOTE: if this flavor is used without a
    previously installed devel/jdk/1.3 package, the port will
    build the jdk twice!

  no_plugin     
    The Mozilla plugin is not built. If the plugin is not needed
    this flavor reduces runtime dependencies.
@


1.2
log
@- Stop installing man pages in man dirs.  Use @@mandir instead to avoid
  conflicts with JRE and future JDKs.
- Add flavor descriptions to DESCR*.
- Add missing lib depend via MODULES devel/gettext.
- Comment the native_threads dir creation that was added in a recent commit.
