@- enter 1.3.1 on sparc. due to the small datasize ulimit on sparc -Xmx60
is about as high as you can go. tomcat v4 and demos work but a bit slowly.

1.1
log
@- Add support for powerpc. With some tips from tedu@@ and drahn@@, thanks!
- Change bootstrap method. No longer use 1.3-linux port to bootstrap.
  Use class files from a linux binary jdk and extra source and header
  files from my website.
- Remove plugin support. plugin has security issues and doesn't work
  with recent mozilla/firefox versions.
- Patches for arm native-threads are included but not enabled yet.
  I prefer to have all arches use green-threads to avoid arch specific
  pkg files. Also noticed some regressions with native-threads on i386.
  arm support from Dale Rahn (drahn@@).
- quiet pre-patch phase

okay ian@@
