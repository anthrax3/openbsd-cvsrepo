@Eliminiate with_ipv6 FLAVOR. ipv6 will be included in the main package
by default now. However ipv4 will continue to be the default address
family in the package. To enable ipv6 (and disable ipv4 in the process),
see package README's. okay sthen@@ with feedback from ajacoutot@@

  with_ipv6
    Build the jdk/jre with ipv6 support. When the jdk/jre is built
    with this flavor, java will create only ipv6 sockets by default.
    Since ipv4 to ipv6 address mapping is disabled on OpenBSD,
    using ipv4 addresses will fail. Consequently, you may only
    use ipv6 addresses or you can start java with
    -Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true and can only use ipv4
    addresses.

The OpenJDK SDK software includes tools useful for developing and
testing programs written in the Java programming language and
running on the Java platform.

Most of the upstream *bsd porting was done by FreeBSD java developers.
The OpenBSD portions were done by myself and Bryan C. Everly.
