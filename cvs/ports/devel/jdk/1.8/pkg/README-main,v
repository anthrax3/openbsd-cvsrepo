@Eliminiate with_ipv6 FLAVOR. ipv6 will be included in the main package
by default now. However ipv4 will continue to be the default address
family in the package. To enable ipv6 (and disable ipv4 in the process),
see package README's. okay sthen@@ with feedback from ajacoutot@@

reduced memory setting
======================
  The default compressed class space size has been reduced from 1G to
  256M to accommodate smaller datasize ulimits. It can be increased with
  the -XX:CompressedClassSpaceSize argument for applications that run
  out of this space.

ipv4 and v6 networking
======================
  ipv4 to ipv6 address mapping is disabled on OpenBSD. This means the
  jdk can only use ipv4 addresses or ipv6 addresses but not both at
  the same time. By default ipv4 addresses are enabled. To use ipv6
  addresses set the following properties when you start java:

  -Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=false
  -Djava.net.preferIPv6Stack=true
  -Djava.net.preferIPv6Addresses=true

The OpenJDK SDK software includes tools useful for developing and
testing programs written in the Java programming language and
running on the Java platform.

Most of the upstream *bsd porting was done by FreeBSD java developers.
The OpenBSD portions were done by myself and Bryan C. Everly.
