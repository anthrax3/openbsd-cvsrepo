@- switch to GPLv2 w/CLASSPATH exception licensed openjdk7 code
- update to early access build 24
- Use GPLv2 licensed binary plugs from the IcedTea project and parts of
  IcedTea's icedtea-copy-plugs.patch & icedtea-graphics.patch.
  For more info see:
    http://icedtea.classpath.org/wiki/Main_Page
- Enable packages since we're fully GPLv2 based now, but still not
  hooked up to bulk builds just yet.

@- update to build 15
- switch to the JRL licensed src. why? because it will allow me to complete
the port. OpenJDK/GPLv2 src isn't complete and the parts that we don't have
are only released in binary form with a defend and indemnify clause. When
all of the jdk is GPLv2 I will switch back to OpenJDK/GPLv2 src.
- copy the Linux src files for the rest of the jdk so i can begin to patch
them. One src file is based on solaris code since that suits us better as
a starting point.
