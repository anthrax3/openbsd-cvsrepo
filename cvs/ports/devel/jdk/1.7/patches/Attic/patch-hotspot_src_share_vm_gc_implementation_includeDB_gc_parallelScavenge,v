@Various minor corrections:
- Remove some patches no longer needed
- Sync some corba and jdk makefiles with bsd-port repo
- Another datatype correction in hotspot
- Use proper scoping for clock_get* from bsd-port repo
- Use includeDB corrections from Coleen Phillimore @@ Sun
instead of my own ones. From hotspot-dev list.

1.1.1.1
log
@Initial import of jdk 1.7 (a.k.a. OpenJDK 7) work in progress. So far Sun
has released the hotspot portion of 1.7 under GPLv2. j2se and deploy
(plugin & webstart) will come later. No packages yet since j2se is copied
in from 1.5.

Note: hotspot for BSD in previous versions of the jdk were based on a
mixture of Solaris code and Linux code (for amd64). In this version I have
selected Linux as the base and only ported of small parts of the Solaris
code as needed. Using Linux code as the base has significantly reduced the
code divergence for BSD support and should make maintaining the port
easier.

okay ian@@, go for it espie@@
