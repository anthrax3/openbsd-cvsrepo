log
@- switch to GPLv2 w/CLASSPATH exception licensed openjdk7 code
- update to early access build 24
- Use GPLv2 licensed binary plugs from the IcedTea project and parts of
  IcedTea's icedtea-copy-plugs.patch & icedtea-graphics.patch.
  For more info see:
    http://icedtea.classpath.org/wiki/Main_Page
- Enable packages since we're fully GPLv2 based now, but still not
  hooked up to bulk builds just yet.

1.1
log
@Remove BROKEN and update port to b19. The port is fully 1.7 now (both
hotspot and j2se). The j2se patches are from the bsd java repositories
1.5 -> 1.6 (performed by Greg Lewis) -> 1.7 by myself. j2se patches are
in sync with 1.6 patchset 1 plus the Runtime.exec fix from Michiel Boland
via FreeBSD PR http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/query-pr.cgi?pr=115557.

Also from FreeBSD: interactive JRL license verification. By default the
port is IS_INTERACTIVE=Yes. Add ACCEPT_JRL_LICENSE=Yes to /etc/mk.conf
to permanently accept the JRL license.

At some point in the future I will work on switching this back to
OpenJDK/GPLv2 src. That largely depends on Sun's progress at removing more
of the binary plug bits so that stubbing out the remainder is less
cumbersome and time consuming.

Testing, comments and okay ian@@
