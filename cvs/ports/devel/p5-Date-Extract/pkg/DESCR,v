@Date::Extract takes an arbitrary block of text, searches it for
something that looks like a date string, and builds a DateTime
object out of it.  By design it will produce few false positives.
This means it will not catch nearly everything that looks like a
date string. So if you have the string "do homework for class 2019"
it won't return a DateTime object with the year set to 2019.
