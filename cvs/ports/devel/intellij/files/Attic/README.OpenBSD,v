@IntelliJ on OpenBSD
===================

1. Windowing Problems
---------------------

If the splash-screen displays but you then only see a grey main screen,
install the wmname package and run 'wmname LG3D'. This is a problem that
has been seen with some Java-based applications used with a non-reparenting
window manager (e.g. cwm).

2. Native Libraries
-------------------

Functionality depending on native libraries is not likely to work.

If you have windowing problems, it has been reported that you may need
to install x11/wmname to fix the problem.

2. JDK Version
--------------

Note that intellij requires JDK 1.6 and will not work with OpenJDK 1.7.
If you have a 'java' binary on your path ahead of JDK 1.6 or if you
define $JAVA_HOME to be something other than JDK 1.6, javaPathHelper
could pick those up resulting in the application failing to launch.
