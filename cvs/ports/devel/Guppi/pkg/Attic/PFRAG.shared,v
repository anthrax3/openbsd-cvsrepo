@Import Guppi 0.40.3

Guppi is a GPLed Gnome-based guile-scriptable plot program with
integrated statistics capabilities.

It is still in an early stage of development.  The current
functionality is very limited.  The source code is the only
documentation .

This package is only included for use in gnucash.
