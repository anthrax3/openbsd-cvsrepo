@Python Distribution Utilities, or Distutils for short, are a
collection of modules that aid in the development, distribution,
and installation of Python modules.  (It is intended that ultimately
the Distutils will grow up into a system for distributing and
installing whole Python applications, but for now their scope is
primarily module distributions.)

The Distutils are a standard part of Python versions 1.6 and higher;
if you are running 1.6/2.0/2.1, you don't need to install the
Distutils separately.  This release is primarily so that you can
add the Distutils to a Python 1.5.2 installation -- you will then
be able to install modules that require the Distutils, or use the
Distutils to distribute your own modules.
