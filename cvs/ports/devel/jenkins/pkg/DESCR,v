@Jenkins is a community continuation of Hudson, the continuous
integration (CI) server (for information on CI see
http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html).
Written in Java and with a web-based configuration interface, Jenkins
can be run standalone (contains its own tiny web server) or in any
standard Java-capable web server or application server.
But not limited to Java: can test almost anything, particularly
projects built with Make, Ant, Maven, or similar.
