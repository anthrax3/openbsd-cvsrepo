@Remove SECURITY files. They have served their purpose in the past but
have become pretty useless nowadays (and the pkg tools do not display
them anyway).
Some which contained valuable information have been turned into READMEs.

@Jenkins runs external processes such as CVS, Ant, Make and so on,
whose path is configurable from the web menu system.

Please make very sure to enable login restriction under Manage
Jenkins -> Configure Global Security if your server is reachable
from any (untrusted) network! If you only run it on localhost, be
sure to block access to the HTTP port using pf(8).

Take these steps before you start the server the first time!
