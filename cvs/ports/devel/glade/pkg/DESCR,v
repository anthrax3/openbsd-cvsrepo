@Import glade-3.10.0 (for gtk+3)

Glade is a RAD tool to enable quick & easy development of user
interfaces for the GTK+ toolkit and the GNOME desktop environment.
The user interfaces designed in Glade are stored in XML format, enabling
easy integration with external tools.
In particular libglade can load the XML files and create the interfaces
at runtime. The DTD for the XML files is included with libglade, and is
also at http://glade.gnome.org/glade-2.0.dtd.
Other tools are available which can turn the XML files into source code
in languages such as C++, Perl and Python.
