@Initial revision

text
@SRC (Simple Revision Control) is RCS, reloaded.

It remains determinedly file-oriented and doesn't even track the
committer of a change (because that's always you), but incorporates
the design and user-interface lessons of modern systems.  It features
sequential revision numbers, lockless operation, embedded command
help, and a command set that will seem familiar to users of Subversion,
Mercurial, and Git.
