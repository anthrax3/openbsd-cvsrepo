@Sometimes you want roles. You're not sure about Moose, Mouse, Moo
and what was that damned Squirrel thing anyway? Then there's
Class::Trait, but it has a funky syntax and the maintainer's
deprecated it in favor of Moose::Role and you really don't care
that it handles overloading, instance application or has a workaround
for the SUPER:: bug.
