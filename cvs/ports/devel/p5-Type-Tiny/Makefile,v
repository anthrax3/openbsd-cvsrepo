@import p5-Type-Tiny-1.000005

    Type::Tiny is a small class for writing type constraints, inspired
    by Moose's type constraint API. It has only one non-core dependency
    (and even that is simply a module that was previously distributed as
    part of Type::Tiny but has since been spun off), and can be used
    with Moose, Mouse and Moo (or none of the above).
