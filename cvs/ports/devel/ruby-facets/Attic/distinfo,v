@initial import of facets-2.7.0

Ruby Facets is a collection of general purpose, pure-Ruby extensions
and additions for the Ruby programming language. Facets is divided into
two libraries, one for the extensions and the other for the additions.
called Facets/CORE and Facets/MORE, respectively.

Facets/CORE is a large collection of methods which extend the core
capabilities of Ruby's built-in classes and modules. This collection of
extension methods are unique by virtue of their atomicity. The methods
are stored individually so that each can be required independently.
This gives developers fine-grain control over which extra methods to bring
into his or her code. The collection currently contains over 400 methods
spanning 28 classes and modules. It is an atomic library in that the
methods are packaged individually so that each can be required
independently. This gives the programmer greater control to
include only the extra methods he or she actually needs.

Facets/MORE are a collection of classes, modules and light frameworks
whcih cons itutes an ever growing and improving source of reusable
components. Some very nice additions are provided, from an amazing SI
Units system to an elegant Annotations system. And of course there are
all the more typical goodies like Tuple, Functor and Multiton.
