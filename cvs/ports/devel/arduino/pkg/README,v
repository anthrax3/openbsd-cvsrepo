+-----------------------------------------------------------------------
| Running ${FULLPKGNAME} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

This port contains the libraries/headers as well as examples and documentation
needed to start developing with Arduino.

For now it doesn't contain the frontend application yet, instead a Makefile
and various helper scripts are provided.

Typical Usage
=============

* Use ${TRUEPREFIX}/bin/arduinoproject to create a new project directory.
* Hack the .ino file.
* `make` will build the project.
* `make upload` flashes the program to your arduino.

Before you can upload your programs, you should review the AVRdude
variables in the Makefile. Different arduino models require different
parameters; pay particular attention to UPLOAD_RATE and
AVRDUDE_PROGRAMMER.

If you do not know which parameters you need, take a peek at:
${TRUEPREFIX}/share/arduino/boards.txt

Syntax Highlighting
===================

* vim:   http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2654
* emacs: https://github.com/bookest/arduino-mode

@import arduino 22

Arduino is an open-source electronics prototyping platform based on
flexible, easy-to-use hardware and software. It's intended for artists,
designers, hobbyists, and anyone interested in creating interactive
objects or environments. 
[..]
This package contains the libraries, header files and tools to develop
Arduino sketches. It does not include the Arduino IDE frontend.
