1.2
log
@Polish up the toolchain:
	- get rid of libtool and thus rpath bugs
	- install libexec files as they're also needed
	- copy the crt files in lib/gcc/i386-mingw32/3.4.5 as the
	  compiler looks for them in there and not in lib
	- disable shared and thus lose the platform specific files
	  (noticed by jeremy@@ as well)
	- adapt the README after these changes
