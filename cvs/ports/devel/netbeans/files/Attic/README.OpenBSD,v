@- update netbeans to 6.9.1
- switch to pkg-readmes

from daniel dickman (MAINTAINER) with small tweaks by me

@NetBeans 6.8 on OpenBSD
=======================

1. Help System
--------------

NetBeans relies on the presence of a firefox binary for access to
the online help system. Firefox is not set up as a runtime dependency
as this dependency is optional.

If you have Firefox 3.5 on your system you may want to set up the
following symbolic link:

ln -s /usr/local/bin/firefox35 /usr/local/bin/firefox

You can also customize this setting within the IDE by going to
Tools> Options> General> Web Browser.

2. Font issues in the output window
-----------------------------------

After hitting the Clean & Build or the Run buttons from
within the IDE, the output window will show square boxes
instead of fonts.

Bug 145696 was filed but marked as WONTFIX by NetBeans developers:
	https://netbeans.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=145696

3. Native Libraries
-------------------

The profiler module is not included in the port. Additionally,
the following modules, although included, contain native code which
will likely not work:
- cnd
- dlight
- ruby

@Update to netbeans 6.8, from Daniel Dickman on ports@@ a while ago,
who also takes maintainership, with a minor tweak by me (chown
${BINOWN}:${BINGRP} in do-install so that it packages properly when
built as user)
See http://marc.info/?l=openbsd-ports&m=126223375703003&w=2 and
http://marc.info/?l=openbsd-ports&m=126216832521398&w=2 for details.
Also tested by Brandon Mercer and Fred Crowson, with much prodding from
Brandon Mercer.

If you have Firefox 3.5 on your system (but don't have Firefox 3.0)
you may want to set up the following symbolic link:

2. BindException
----------------

You may get a BindException when you launch NetBeans:

java.net.BindException: Can't assign requested address
	at java.net.PlainSocketImpl.socketBind(Native Method)
	at java.net.PlainSocketImpl.bind(PlainSocketImpl.java:359)

Bug 179113 was filed:

This issue should be fixed in the upcoming 6.9 release.
