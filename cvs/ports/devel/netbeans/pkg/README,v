Font issues in the output window
================================

After hitting the Clean & Build or the Run buttons from
within the IDE, the output window will show square boxes
instead of fonts.

Bug 145696 was filed but marked as WONTFIX by NetBeans developers:
	https://netbeans.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=145696

Native Libraries
================

The profiler module is not included in the port. Additionally,
the following modules, although included, contain native code which
will likely not work:
- cnd
- dlight

@Add a consistent header that substitutes FULLPKGNAME for the READMEs.

Help System
===========

NetBeans relies on the presence of a firefox binary for access to
the online help system. Firefox is not set up as a runtime dependency
as this dependency is optional.

If you have Firefox 3.5 on your system you may want to set up the
following symbolic link:

ln -s ${LOCALBASE}/bin/firefox35 ${LOCALBASE}/bin/firefox

You can also customize this setting within the IDE by going to
Tools> Options> General> Web Browser.
