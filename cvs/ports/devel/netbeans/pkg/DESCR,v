@Update to netbeans 6.8, from Daniel Dickman on ports@@ a while ago,
who also takes maintainership, with a minor tweak by me (chown
${BINOWN}:${BINGRP} in do-install so that it packages properly when
built as user)
See http://marc.info/?l=openbsd-ports&m=126223375703003&w=2 and
http://marc.info/?l=openbsd-ports&m=126216832521398&w=2 for details.
Also tested by Brandon Mercer and Fred Crowson, with much prodding from
Brandon Mercer.
