text
@The Open MPI Project is an open source MPI-2 implementation that is
developed and maintained by a consortium of academic, research, and
industry partners. Open MPI is therefore able to combine the expertise,
technologies, and resources from all across the High Performance
Computing community in order to build the best MPI library available.
Open MPI offers advantages for system and software vendors, application
developers and computer science researchers.

Features implemented or in short-term development for Open MPI:
- Full MPI-2 standards conformance 
- Thread safety and concurrency 
- Dynamic process spawning 
- Network and process fault tolerance 
- Support network heterogeneity 
- Single library supports all networks 
- Run-time instrumentation 
- Many job schedulers supported
- Many OS's supported (32 and 64 bit) 
- Production quality software 
- High performance on all platforms 
- Portable and maintainable 
- Tunable by installers and end-users 
- Component-based design, documented APIs 
- Active, responsive mailing list 
- Open source license based on the BSD license
