@Remove devel/hs-shellish. Not used by anything.

text
@The shellish package provides a single module for convenient "systems"
programming in Haskell, similar in spirit to POSIX shells or PERL.

* Elegance and safety is sacrificed for conciseness and
  swiss-army-knife-ness.

* The interface exported by Shellish is thread-safe.

Overall, the module should help you to get a job done quickly,
without getting too dirty.
