@add shtool port

This is a compilation of small but very stable and portable shell
scripts into a single shell tool. All ingredients were in successful
use over many years in various Open Source projects. The compiled
shtool program is intended to be used inside the source tree of Open
Source packages.  There it can overtake various (usually non-portable)
tasks related to the building and installation of an Open Source package.
