@Test::Most exists to reduce boilerplate and to make your testing
life easier. We provide "one stop shopping" for most commonly used
testing modules. In fact, we often require the latest versions so
that you get bug fixes through Test::Most and don't have to keep
upgrading these modules separately.

This module provides you with the most commonly used testing
functions, along with automatically turning on strict and warning
and gives you a bit more fine-grained control over your test suite.
