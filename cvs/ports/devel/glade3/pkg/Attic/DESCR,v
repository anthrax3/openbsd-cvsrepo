@Glade is a RAD tool to enable quick & easy development of user
interfaces for the GTK+ toolkit and the GNOME desktop environment.

The user interfaces designed in Glade are saved as XML, and by using the
libglade library these can be loaded by applications dynamically as
needed.

By using libglade, Glade XML files can be used in numerous programming
languages including C, C++, Java, Perl, Python, C#, Pike, Ruby, Haskell,
Objective Caml and Scheme. Adding support for other languages is easy
too.

@Resurrect devel/glade3 from the Attic and update it to 3.8.2. It can
still be used by Gtk2 apps/libs, while devel/glade is Gtk3 only.
No conflict as they can be installed alongside.
