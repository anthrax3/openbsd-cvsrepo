1.2
log
@Update to 0.14.0 which now handles -pthread without patching (hmpf "patch
from FreeBSD guys" indeed).

The included glib-1.2.8 is no longer built, instead our in-tree glib is
linked statically.  This avoids a reported problem on macppc arches.

@Make pkg-config propagate linker flags other than -l and -L, needed
for dependency chains with -pthread in it.
