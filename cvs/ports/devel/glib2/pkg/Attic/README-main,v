File and directory monitor
==========================
GLib (GFileMonitor) provides realtime kqueue(2) notifications and
monitoring up to the open file descriptors limit.
If gio-kqueue needs to handle large directories, the kern.maxfiles
sysctl(8) should be increased by adding an entry in sysctl.conf(5) and
the user's login(1) class modified accordingly by bumping the "cur" and
"max" openfiles limit in login.conf(5).

The ${SYSCONFDIR}/gio-kqueue.conf file contains the paths that should be
monitored using traditional polling instead of kqueue(2).

1.1
log
@Integrate the GLib kqueue(2) backend from Dmitry Matveev's GSoC 2011.

As a consequence, explicitely disable the FAM backend.
This bring a huge improvement compared to what we've been using before
(gio-fam+gamin): file / directory monitoring and notifications are next
to instantaneous without any cpu overhead like it was before.

This means we can also drop the bootstrap FLAVOR of gamin that was
needed because of the cyclic dependency (gamin->glib2->gamin).
