@Update to glib2-2.29.92 (2.30 coming in the next few days).
Committing now (along with upcoming atk, pango and gtk+3 updates) during
the hackathon where we have time to fix all the eventual fallout (bulk
running).

@Workaround the fact that we cannot pass SCM_CREDS over unix sockets:
implement the "intended" SCM_CREDS stack as if we had support for that
in the kernel (by-pass it almost completely).
send/recv a single null byte without creds, but on recv, just do a
getsockopt(SO_PEERCRED) and return that as if it coming from the cmsg.
This works as long as creds are not retreived from an fd which has
already been handed over to a different process via SCM_RIGHTS. It will
probably not be enough in the future but we'll see then.
all this work done by eric@@ (thanks!) and tested by myself

Enable support for g_credential*
Fix a couple of warnings.
