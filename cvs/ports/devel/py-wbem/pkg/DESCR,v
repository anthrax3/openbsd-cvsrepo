@PyWBEM is a Python library for making CIM operations over HTTP using the
WBEM CIM-XML protocol. It is based on the idea that a good WBEM client
should be easy to use and not necessarily require a large amount of
programming knowledge. PyWBEM is suitable for a large range of tasks
from simply poking around to writing web and GUI applications.
