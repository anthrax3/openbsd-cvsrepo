@Blessings lifts several of curses' limiting assumptions, and it makes
your code pretty, too:

  - Use styles, color, and maybe a little positioning without
    necessarily clearing the whole screen first.
  - Leave more than one screenful of scrollback in the buffer after your
    program exits, like a well-behaved command-line app should.

  - Get rid of all those noisy, C-like calls to tigetstr and tparm, so
    your code doesn't get crowded out by terminal bookkeeping.

  - Act intelligently when somebody redirects your output to a file,
    omitting the terminal control codes the user doesn't want to see
    (optional).
