1.2
log
@Update xulrunner 1.9.0.14 to 1.9.1.7, latest release in the branch
corresponding to ffx 3.5.x. Most patches taken from there, tested
successfully @@ppc/amd64/sparc64. Branch 1.9.0.x is approaching attic
upstream, as ffx 3.0.x.
The plan is to move all users of xulrunner/1.8 to use this latest
version, and then ditch the old unmaintained one from ffx 2.x days.

@import xulrunner 1.9, and implement infrastructure for multiple
xulrunners.  this was necessary for smooth migration, since we want
plugins work for mozilla 1.8 branch too (seamonkey, thunderbird);
they are upwards-compatible if built against 1.8.  however, some
new applications started to depend on 1.9, and also other (non-plugin)
apps will start to migrate so that the old xulrunner can go away
requested by many;  bulk build & pkgpath & bump done by sthen@@
