1.1
log
@Update xulrunner 1.9.0.14 to 1.9.1.7, latest release in the branch
corresponding to ffx 3.5.x. Most patches taken from there, tested
successfully @@ppc/amd64/sparc64. Branch 1.9.0.x is approaching attic
upstream, as ffx 3.0.x.
The plan is to move all users of xulrunner/1.8 to use this latest
version, and then ditch the old unmaintained one from ffx 2.x days.
