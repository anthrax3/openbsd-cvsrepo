@Remove devel/xulrunner/1.9, www/fennec, www/firefox36 and productivity/sunbird

- nothing uses xulrunner 1.9 anymore, and that branch was EOL'd upstream
  20 months ago (firefox36 was already unlinked from the build)
- www/fennec as a xul app is dead upstream, since now firefox mobile is
  built on top of java android libs and thus unportable to regular OS.
The esr10 branch from which it was built upon was EOL'd upstream 10 months ago
- productivity/sunbird as a standalone app is dead upstream since 3
  years, hypothetical users should just use thunderbird+lightning which
is still supported/developed.

No complains from ports@@, this will allow for a serious mozilla ports
cleanup, and we're down to 5 mozillas in the ports tree.

@Cope with patch-config_autoconf_mk_in change in www/mozilla-firefox.
Switch PLISTs to use MOZILLA_PROJECT semantics, but do not convert the
port to www/mozilla MODULE yet. xulrunner 1.8 needs to be buried first.

@Update to xulrunner 1.9.2.3 (from 1.9.1.7) :
- mozilla don't do real releases anymore from xulrunner itself, so build
  it from firefox 3.6.3 tarball. Thx tnn@@netbsd for the trick.
- that also permits us to use patches/ and files/ from
  www/mozilla-firefox, and stop mirroring another 50Mb distfile. Yay!
- some headers are MI, so do the PFRAG.{amd64,jit}-devel dance in PLIST
sthen@@ thinks 'going in this direction makes a lot of sense'.
