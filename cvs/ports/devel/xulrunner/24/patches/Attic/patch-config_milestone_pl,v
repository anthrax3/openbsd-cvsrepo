1.2
log
@Remove xulrunner/24.

Doesn't build with clang (and it's a fscking maze of
defines/headers/wrappers to fix..), this branch is dead upstream since 3
years, all consumers have been either removed or prevented from using it,
and xul itself as a technology is considered dead upstream, HTML5 killed
it.

further cleanup to come in mozilla.port.mk.
