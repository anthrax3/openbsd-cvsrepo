1.1.1.1
log
@Initial import of xulrunner 24.0.

Based off Firefox 24 ESR engine, with 300% less patching included, and
finally using a standard directory layout!
- Similar split between -main & -devel as done in 1.9.
- Can be installed alongside 1.9
- Ports using 1.9 will gradually be migrated to 24 so that the
unmaintained 1.9 can hit the attic..
- Should build on ppc & sparc64, and maybe even alpha. Time will tell..
- manually strip the sdk/lib/lib*.so libraries, otherwise that copy of
  libxul is 1Gb on amd64..
- To be improved in-tree over time, but will be linked to the build.
