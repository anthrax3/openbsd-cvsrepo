@import Module::Loaded 0.01

When testing applications, often you find yourself needing to provide
functionality in your test environment that would usually be provided by
external modules. Rather than munging the %INC by hand to mark these
external modules as loaded, so they are not attempted to be loaded by
perl, this module offers you a very simple way to mark modules as loaded
and/or unloaded.
