@rcs-fast-import unpacks a git fast-import stream into an RCS file tree

It keeps the revision structure, comments, authorship dates, and tag
names.  It loses tag dates and comments and authorship information;
commits are recorded as though they were from the user invoking it.
However, all import-stream metadata is preserved in RFC-822-style
headers in commits.
