@- update to 3.2.1
- incorporate patches to allow building with newer gecko from
http://overlays.gentoo.org/proj/java/browser/other/eclipse-patches/3.2.1/.
however still building/depending on www/mozilla since we don't have a
-devel firefox package yet. Also use NS_InitXPCOM2 instead of NS_InitXPCOM3
since exists in both the suite and firefox.
- restructure sub-packages for standalone swt installs. people using
eclipse-gnome and/or eclipse-mozilla will need to manually pkg_delete /
pkg_add due to the restructure.
tested by ian@@, jolan@@ and some input steven@@

@conflicts from the past: history since 3.7.

As noted on ports@@ recently, pkg_add -r relies on conflicts, and the
sheer existence of updates means we MUST take the past into account in
conflicts now.

Note the renaming of hugs98 to valid package names where versions are
concerned.

This commit shows clearly the renaming of the xfce4 plugin packages, the
ditching of eclipse flavors, the splitting of nessus into subpackages,
the splitting of various other software documentations, some packaging bugs
in kdeedu, and a lot of files moving around...
