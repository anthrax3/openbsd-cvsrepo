@Retire devel/eclipse, 3.2.2 is from 2007, and probably doesn't cope well
with 'modern java' we have now. Oh, and it also depends on ruby/1.8.

It might come back as there's a 4.2.2 port in openbsd-wip, but it isn't
from 2013 and not finished yet.

If you need a fullblown java IDE, there's intellij (maintained) and
netbeans (updated in 2010, but pending work by rafael sadowski ?).

@- update to 3.2.1
- incorporate patches to allow building with newer gecko from
http://overlays.gentoo.org/proj/java/browser/other/eclipse-patches/3.2.1/.
however still building/depending on www/mozilla since we don't have a
-devel firefox package yet. Also use NS_InitXPCOM2 instead of NS_InitXPCOM3
since exists in both the suite and firefox.
- restructure sub-packages for standalone swt installs. people using
eclipse-gnome and/or eclipse-mozilla will need to manually pkg_delete /
pkg_add due to the restructure.
tested by ian@@, jolan@@ and some input steven@@
