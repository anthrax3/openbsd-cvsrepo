@Retire devel/eclipse, 3.2.2 is from 2007, and probably doesn't cope well
with 'modern java' we have now. Oh, and it also depends on ruby/1.8.

It might come back as there's a 4.2.2 port in openbsd-wip, but it isn't
from 2013 and not finished yet.

If you need a fullblown java IDE, there's intellij (maintained) and
netbeans (updated in 2010, but pending work by rafael sadowski ?).

popular Java IDEs for seamless management of Struts applications
from one central development tool. This port enables its use in Eclipse.
