1.4
log
@Retire devel/eclipse, 3.2.2 is from 2007, and probably doesn't cope well
with 'modern java' we have now. Oh, and it also depends on ruby/1.8.

It might come back as there's a 4.2.2 port in openbsd-wip, but it isn't
from 2013 and not finished yet.

If you need a fullblown java IDE, there's intellij (maintained) and
netbeans (updated in 2010, but pending work by rafael sadowski ?).

@SUBDIR += is wrong: it means the makefile will pick up SUBDIR from env, thus
breaking cd /usr/ports && SUBDIR=some/path make something for
category makefiles. While there, also put spaces around += uniformously.
