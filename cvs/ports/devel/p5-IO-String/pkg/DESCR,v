@The module provides the IO::File interface for in-core strings.  An
object can be attached to a string, and will make it possible to
use the normal file operations for reading or writing data, as well
as seeking to various locations of the string. The main reason you
might want to do this is if you have some other library module
that only provide an interface to file handles, and you want to
keep all the stuff in memory.
