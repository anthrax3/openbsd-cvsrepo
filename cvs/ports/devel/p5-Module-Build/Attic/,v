Initial import of Module-Build-0.25

"Module::Build" is a system for building, testing, and installing Perl
modules. It is meant to be a replacement for "ExtUtils::MakeMaker".
Developers may alter the behavior of the module through subclassing in a
much more straightforward way than with "MakeMaker". It also does not
require a "make" on your system, most of the "Module::Build" code is
pure-perl and written in a very cross-platform way.
