@Libconfig is a simple library for manipulating structured configuration
files. This file format is more compact and more readable than XML. And
unlike XML, it is type-aware, so it is not necessary to do string
parsing in application code.

Libconfig is very compact - for example, the stripped C shared library
is much smaller than the expat XML parser library. This makes it
well-suited for memory-constrained systems like handheld devices.

Libconfig is very compact - just 25K for the stripped C shared library
(one-fifth the size of the expat XML parser library) and 39K for the
stripped C++ shared library. This makes it well-suited for
memory-constrained systems like handheld devices.
