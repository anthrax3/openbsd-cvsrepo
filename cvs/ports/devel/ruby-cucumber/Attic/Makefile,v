@REVISION bump all ruby ports due to a change in the pkgspec.
Previously, we were using ruby->=1.8,<=1.9, instead of
ruby->=1.8,<1.9.  While this wouldn't cause an issue, since
our ruby-1.9.2 package isn't included in ruby->=1.8,<=1.9,
it's still wrong and should be fixed.  This also fixes the
following minor issues:

Switch from using FLAVOR to MODRUBY_FLAVOR for *_DEPENDS.
Currently we don't have a ruby port that uses FLAVORs that
would differ from MODRUBY_FLAVOR, but it's possible we will
in the future.

Switch from BASE_PKGPATH to BUILD_PKGPATH in a few cases in
REGRESS_DEPENDS.  This probably is not strictly necessary, but
BUILD_PKGPATH is used in more cases, so it is good for
consistency.

Switch to new style *_DEPENDS, with the version specification
at the end.  The remaining cases where this is not done is
because a specific version is used.

Some FULLPKGNAME added to REGRESS_DEPENDS, to make sure that if
the old version is installed when you run a regress test, it
will install the new version first.

Some conversion of spaces to tabs for consistency.

@Remove MASTER_SITE_GITHUB

This was only used in two ports, and will never be used in more ports
as GitHub no longer builds new gems.  Both of the ports are also
found on rubygems.org, so this switches them to use the standard
MASTER_SITE_RUBYGEMS from ruby.port.mk. ruby-findmyiphone has a small
change from the GitHub version that requires a package bump.

@Bump all ruby ports not already handled.

In the upgrade from ruby 1.8.6 to 1.8.7, the PLISTs changed
due to differences in how RDoc processes files.

This also has a number of changes to the regress tests to
work with the changes to devel/ruby-rake.  It moves most of
the regress tests to use MODRUBY_REGRESS.
