@Soup is a SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) implementation in C. 

It provides an queued asynchronous callback-based mechanism for sending
and servicing SOAP requests, and a WSDL (Web Service Definition Language)
to C compiler which generates client stubs and server skeletons for easily
calling and implementing SOAP methods.
