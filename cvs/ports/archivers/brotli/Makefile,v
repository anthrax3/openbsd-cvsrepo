Brotli is a generic-purpose lossless compression algorithm that
compresses data using a combination of a modern variant of the LZ77
algorithm, Huffman coding and 2nd order context modeling, with a
compression ratio comparable to the best currently available
general-purpose compression methods. It is similar in speed with
deflate but offers more dense compression.
