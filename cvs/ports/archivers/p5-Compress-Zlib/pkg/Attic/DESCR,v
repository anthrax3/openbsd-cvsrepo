@The Compress::Zlib module provides a Perl interface to the zlib
compression library (which is part of OpenBSD).  Most of the
functionality provided by zlib is available in Compress::Zlib.

The module can be split into two general areas of functionality,
namely in-memory compression/decompression and read/write access
to gzip files.

       in this documentfor details about where to get zlib). Most

       functionality, namely in-memory compression/decompression
       and read/write access to gzip files. Each of these areas
       will be discussed separately below.

       WARNING: The interface defined in this document is alpha
       and is liable to change.
