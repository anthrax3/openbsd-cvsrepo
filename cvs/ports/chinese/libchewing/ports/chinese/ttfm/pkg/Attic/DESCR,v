@A True Type Font Manager that handles true type font
installation, uninstallation, list, and default font
setting.  It was originally in the CLE distribution.

The manager doesn't deal with applications using TTF
directly.  Instead, it calls modules to handle the
details.  There are only several predefined behaviours
of the modules, like add/remove/list.  There are four
modules as of version 0.9:

chitex: For ChiTeX, a Chinese TeX/LaTeX
ttf2pk: Generate pk/tfm for CJK
xfreetype: For Xfsft in XFree86 3.3.x and "freetype"
           module in 4.x
xttfm: For X-TT in XFree86 3.3.x and "xtt" module in
       4.x, available in both tcl and sh versions.

Some modules are Big5/GB enhanced, for better font
detection/generation.
