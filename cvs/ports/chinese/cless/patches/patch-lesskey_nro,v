 .TH LESSKEY 1
 .SH NAME
-lesskey \- specify key bindings for less
+clesskey \- specify key bindings for cless
 .SH SYNOPSIS
-.B "lesskey [-o output] [input]"
+.B "clesskey [-o output] [input]"
 .br
-.B "lesskey -V"
+.B "clesskey -V"
 .SH DESCRIPTION
 .I Lesskey
 is used to specify a set of key bindings to be used by 
-.I less.
+.I cless.
 The input file is a text file which describes the key bindings,
 If the input file is "-", standard input is read.
-If no input file is specified, $HOME/.lesskey is read.
+If no input file is specified, $HOME/.clesskey is read.
 The output file is a binary file which is used by 
-.I less.
-If no output file is specified, $HOME/.less is written.
+.I cless.
+If no output file is specified, $HOME/.cless is written.
 If the output file already exists,
-.I lesskey
+.I clesskey
 will overwrite it.
 .PP
 The input file consists of lines of the form:

 Whitespace is any sequence of one or more spaces and/or tabs.
 The \fIstring\fP is the command key(s) which invoke the action.
 The \fIstring\fP may be a single command key, or a sequence of up to 15 keys.
-The \fIaction\fP is the name of the less action, from the list below.
+The \fIaction\fP is the name of the cless action, from the list below.
 The characters in the \fIstring\fP may appear literally, or be
 prefixed by a caret to indicate a control key.
 A backslash followed by one to three octal digits may be used to

 .PP
 An action may be followed by an "extra" string.
 When such a command is entered while running
-.I less,
+.I cless,
 the action is performed, and then the extra
 string is parsed, just as if it were typed in to
-.I less.
+.I cless.
 This feature can be used in certain cases to extend
 the functionality of a command.
 For example, see the "{" and ":t" commands in the example below.
 .PP
 The -V flag causes
-.I lesskey
+.I clesskey
 to print its version number and immediately exit.  
 Other flags and arguments are ignored.
 
 .SH EXAMPLE
 The following input file describes the set of
-default command keys used by less:

 .SH PRECEDENCE
 Commands specified by
-.I lesskey
+.I clesskey
 take precedence over the default commands.
 A default command key may be disabled by including it in the
 input file with the action "invalid".
 Alternatively, a key may be defined 
 to do nothing by using the action "noaction".
 "noaction" is similar to "invalid", but 
-.I less
+.I cless
 will give an error beep for an "invalid" command, 
 but not for a "noaction" command.
 In addition, ALL default commands may be disabled by
