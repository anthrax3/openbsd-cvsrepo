@Update fritzing to the latest. Releases have moved to github, so should
be less churn in the weird whay they cut their dist files (now zip.. now
tar_1.bz2.. now..)

OK sthen@@

@Fritzing is essentially Electronic Design Automation software suited to the
needs of designers and artists. It uses the metaphor of the breadboard,
so that it is easy to transfer a hardware sketch to the software by using a
drag-and-drop-based GUI to copy your sketch. From there it is possible
to create PCB layouts for turning your prototype into a robust PCB,
either on your own, or with the help of a manufacturer.
