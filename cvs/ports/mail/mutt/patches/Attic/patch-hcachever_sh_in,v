1.2
log
@update to mutt-1.5.24 (requiring the various optional patchsets, sidebar
etc to be modified), remove some port patches which are un/no-longer
necessary, and avoid depending on autoconf/automake except in those
cases where optional patchsets touch the Makefiles and require auto*
to be regenerated.

Header cache files are sanity-checked so that changes in data types ought to
invalidate the cache, however this doesn't use base types for everything i.e.
it uses "time_t" not the underlying type. Patch to add some extra text to
the hash which ensures that old cache files are invalidated.

1.1
log
@Remove old version of mutt, which is missing fixes made to the 1.5
"snapshot" branch 9 years ago (in fact the 1.4 branch has really only
received a couple of security fixes since 2002).

No naysayers, and positive feedback about the removal from ajacoutot and brad.
