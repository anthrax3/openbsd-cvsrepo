1.4
log
@Remove old version of mutt, which is missing fixes made to the 1.5
"snapshot" branch 9 years ago (in fact the 1.4 branch has really only
received a couple of security fixes since 2002).

No naysayers, and positive feedback about the removal from ajacoutot and brad.

@The Mutt Mail User Agent

This is a nifty e-mail client that includes excellent PGP hooks.
Other features include:

- color support
- message threading
- MIME support (including RFC2047 support for encoded headers)
- IMAP (also over SSL) and POP3 support
- support for multiple mailbox formats (mbox, MMDF, MH, maildir)
- highly customizable, including key bindings
- searches using regular expression
- Delivery Status Notification (DSN) support
- PGP/MIME (RFC2015)
- small and efficient

Flavors:
	slang	   - build using the S-Lang library for screen handling.
	compressed - build with compressed folder support 
		     (see: http://www.spinnaker.de/mutt/compressed/)
	mixmaster  - build with anonymous remailing support.
