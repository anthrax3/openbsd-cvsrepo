@update the main mutt port to 1.7.1, removing flavours:

sidebar - now in the main release (if you use this and your old configuration
doesn't work, review /usr/local/share/examples/mutt/sample.muttrc-sidebar)

compressed folders - use mail/neomutt if you want this
@
text
@Mutt is a small but very powerful text-based mail client for Unix-like
operating systems. Features include support for multiple mailbox formats
(including IMAP, POP3, mbox, MMDF, MH, Maildir), MIME/RFC2047, message
threading, encryption and signing with PGP/GPG and S/MIME, and many
operations can use regular expressions. It's highly customizable with
many options for colours, key bindings, display formats etc.

This package used to have various flavours adding external patches.
Some are now integrated in the main Mutt release (including "sidebar");
the "neomutt" package includes others (e.g. compressed folder support).

Flavors:
	gpgme      - build with support for GPGME, simplifying use with GnuPG:
                     "set crypt_use_gpgme = yes" in muttrc, and run gpg-agent:
                     "export GPG_TTY=$(tty); eval $(gpg-agent --daemon)" 
	sasl	   - build with SASL authentication support
	slang	   - use S-Lang instead of curses for screen handling

This package is built from the NeoMutt tree, adding extra functionality

@Remove old version of mutt, which is missing fixes made to the 1.5
"snapshot" branch 9 years ago (in fact the 1.4 branch has really only
received a couple of security fixes since 2002).

No naysayers, and positive feedback about the removal from ajacoutot and brad.
