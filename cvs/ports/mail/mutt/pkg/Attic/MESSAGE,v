1.1
log
@- assume ispell is installed by default, end user can add the ispell
port/package to use it
- add missing CONFIGURE_ENV options to bring in gettext support
- add a few patches to ensure mutt does not use its own gettext headers
but the headers installed on the system instead
- remove install message from Makefile and put it into pkg/MESSAGE so it's
displayed properly once this port is made into a package
- rename one patch, patch-fix_DOTLOCK_group -> patch-configure
