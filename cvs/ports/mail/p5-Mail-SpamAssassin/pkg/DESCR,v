@SpamAssassin is a mail filter to identify spam.

Using its rule base and optional network sources (DNS-based lists and
collaborative spam-tracking databases), it carries out a wide range of
heuristic tests on mail headers and body text to identify "spam", also
known as unsolicited commercial email.

Once identified, the mail can then be optionally tagged as spam for
later filtering using the user's own mail user-agent application.

SpamAssassin requires very little configuration; you do not need
to continually update it with details of your mail accounts, mailing
list memberships, etc.  It accomplishes filtering without this
knowledge, as much as possible.

Read ${PREFIX}/share/doc/SpamAssassin/README
for further installation instructions.

Or if you are in a hurry you can read:
${PREFIX}/share/doc/SpamAssassin/OpenBSD-SpamAssassin-mini-howto.html

The SpamAssassin Wiki is available at <http://wiki.apache.org/spamassassin>
and contains up-to-date information on configuring SpamAssassin, and using
some of the more advanced features of it.

Using its rule base, it uses a wide range of heuristic tests on
mail headers and body text to identify "spam", also known as
unsolicited commercial email.

The spam-identification tactics used include: 

header analysis: 
                spammers use a number of tricks to mask their
                identities, fool you into thinking they've sent a
                valid mail, or fool you into thinking you must have
                subscribed at some stage.  SpamAssassin tries to
                spot these.

text analysis:
                again, spam mails often have a characteristic style
                (to put it politely), and some characteristic
                disclaimers and CYA text.  SpamAssassin can spot
                these, too.

blacklists: 
                SpamAssassin supports many useful existing blacklists,
                such as mail-abuse.org, ordb.org or others.

Razor:          
                Vipul's Razor is a collaborative spam-tracking
                database, which works by taking a signature of spam
                messages. Since spam typically operates by sending
                an identical message to hundreds of people, Razor
                short-circuits this by allowing the first person
                to receive a spam to add it to the database -- at
                which point everyone else will automatically block
                it.
