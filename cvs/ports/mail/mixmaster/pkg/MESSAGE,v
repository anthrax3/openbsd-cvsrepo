@For using anonymous remailers, up-to-date public key rings are a necessity.
You should fetch these at least daily and provide them to your users.
${PREFIX}/share/examples/mixmaster/mixmaster-update.pl is a sample
script facilitating this task.

All users have their own mixmaster configuration files and pools in
~/.Mix, but global defaults can be specified in
${SYSCONFDIR}/mixmaster/client.cfg. You might want to specify PUBRING and
TYPE2REL in this file to point to some sitewide files fetched, e.g. by the
above mentioned script.

log
@major cleanup, inspired by Peter Palfrader
- no more sgid _mixmaster
- no more global pool
- every user has his own pool/config in ~/.Mix, with
SYSCONFDIR/mixmaster/client.cfg providing a default configuration
- add sample script to fetch remailer keys/statistics
from Peter Palfrader <peter at palfrader dot org>
- remove WWW while here
- fix a bounds warning
- bump PKGNAME
