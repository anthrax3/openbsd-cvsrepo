1.3
log
@Resurrect mail/enigmail, shipping a git tarball from sf.net so that we
can use the "new" auto* build system decoupled from mozilla build system.

mail/enigmail,-main will replace mail/thunderbird,-enigmail (and
respectively, mail/enigmail,-seamonkey will replace
www/seamonkey,-enigmail) now that i've finally figured out how to
install systemwide extensions in ${LOCALBASE}/lib/mozilla/extensions/${APPID}
and how to automagically enable them.

Finally, we only build enigmail once...

@Temporary cvs delete. An infrastructure to build different versions of
enigmail for seamonkey and thunderbird will replace it.. as much as i
hate that way of doing things, seems i have no choice.
