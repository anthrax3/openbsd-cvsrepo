@Update to Sympa 6.1.3.
- switch config dir to /var/sympa/etc as sympa daemon/fcgi might want to
  write templates there
- switch to use spawn-fcgi, this way sympa web admin works fine in
  chrooted httpd
- provide a httpd.conf fragment to ease sympa integration
- switch to rc scripts (with help from aja@@)
- improve README

With help and feedback from J.G Pailloncy, ok ajacoutot@@

management functions such as subscription, moderation and management of
archives. SYMPA also manages sending of messages to the lists, and makes
it possible to reduce the load on the system. It also provides a web
