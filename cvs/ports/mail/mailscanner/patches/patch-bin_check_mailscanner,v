@Have check_mailscanner pick up the "Run As User" setting from
MailScanner.conf and explicitly start as that user. This avoids setuid
in perl (triggering taint mode) and so it sidesteps taint mode fallout
which has appeared recently, most likely due to the CVE-2011-1487 fix
in Perl.

Maintainer believed to be away this week, so committing now and we
can change it later if he disagrees when he returns.   ok todd@@

@import MailScanner 4.66.5-3, a virus/spam scanning framework

MailScanner is a complete e-mail security system designed for use on
e-mail gateways. It protects against viruses, and detects attacks
against e-mail client packages (such as Outlook, Outlook Express,
Eudora). It can also detect almost all unsolicited commercial e-mail
(spam) passing through it and respond to all incidents in a wide variety
of ways.

..see http://www.mailscanner.info/ for more details.

I have included a generic spam scanner that if enabled uses dspam, as an
alternative to SpamAssassin.

Thanks to Brad Smith for helping get this ready for import.  This has been
a few years in the making.
