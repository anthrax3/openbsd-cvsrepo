@The MailScanner port is using the original MailScanner tarball from 
www.mailscanner.info. This tarball puts all the MailScanner files in 
subdirectories

bin	MailScanner binary / MailScanner start script etc.
etc	MailScanner config files / rules / report templates
lib	Virus wrapper and autoupdate scripts / MailScanner Perl libraries
docs	Documentation
var	pid file

In order to make this OpenBSD compliant the port installs those files
in the following directories:

/usr/local/libexec/MailScanner	MailScanner binary, virus wrapper/autoupdate
/usr/local/lib/MailScanner	MailScanner Perl libraries
/usr/local/share/MailScanner	MailScanner report templates
/usr/local/share/doc/MailScanner	Documentation
/usr/local/share/examples/MailScanner	Example files
/etc/MailScanner		MailScanner config files / rules

To activate this port, you must do the following for sendmail:

1. Set the following in your sendmail.mc file:

	define(`confDELIVER_MODE',`queue')
	define(`confPRIVACY_FLAGS',`noetrn')

   (if you do not have a sendmail.mc file, use
    /usr/share/sendmail/cf/openbsd-proto.mc)

   and regenerate your sendmail.cf

   (if you do not know how, try:

	m4 /usr/share/sendmail/m4/cf.m4 sendmail.mc > test.cf
   )
   

2. Put the following line in /etc/rc.conf.local:

	sendmail_flags="-L sm-mta -bd -OQueueDirectory=/var/spool/mqueue.in"

3. Add the following to /etc/rc.local:

  # MailScanner
  if [ -x /usr/sbin/sendmail ]; then
        echo -n ' sm-mta-queue'; /usr/sbin/sendmail -q30s -L sm-mta-queue
  fi

  # MailScanner outbound queue
  if [ -x /usr/local/bin/check_mailscanner ]; then
        echo -n ' MailScanner'; /usr/local/bin/check_mailscanner
  fi

4. Add the following to root's crontab:

  # Check the status of MailScanner every hour
  0       *       *       *       *       /usr/local/bin/check_mailscanner -q

@import MailScanner 4.66.5-3, a virus/spam scanning framework

MailScanner is a complete e-mail security system designed for use on
e-mail gateways. It protects against viruses, and detects attacks
against e-mail client packages (such as Outlook, Outlook Express,
Eudora). It can also detect almost all unsolicited commercial e-mail
(spam) passing through it and respond to all incidents in a wide variety
of ways.

..see http://www.mailscanner.info/ for more details.

I have included a generic spam scanner that if enabled uses dspam, as an
alternative to SpamAssassin.

Thanks to Brad Smith for helping get this ready for import.  This has been
a few years in the making.
