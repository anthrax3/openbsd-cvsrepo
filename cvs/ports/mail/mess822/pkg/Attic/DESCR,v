@mess822 is a library for parsing Internet mail messages. The mess822
package contains several applications that work with qmail:

 * ofmipd rewrites messages from dumb clients. It supports a database
   of recognized senders and From lines, using cdb for fast lookups.

 * new-inject is an experimental new version of qmail-inject. It
   includes a flexible user-controlled hostname rewriting mechanism.

 * iftocc can be used in .qmail files. It checks whether a known
   address is listed in To or Cc.

 * 822header, 822field, 822date, and 822received extract various
   pieces of information from a mail message.

 * 822print converts a message into an easier-to-read format.

mess822 supports the full complexity of RFC 822 address lists,
including address groups, source routes, spaces around dots, etc.
It also supports common RFC 822 extensions: backslashes in atoms,
dots in phrases, addresses without host names, etc. It extracts
each address as an easy-to-use string, with a separate string for
the accompanying comment.

mess822 converts RFC 822 dates into libtai's struct caltime format.
It supports numeric time zones, the standard old-fashioned time
zones, and many nonstandard time zones.

mess822 is fast. For example, extracting 10000 addresses from a
160KB To field takes less than a second on a Pentium-100.
