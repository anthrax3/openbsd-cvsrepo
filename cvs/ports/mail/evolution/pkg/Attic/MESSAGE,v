@Big spring cleanup:

* split in 2 packages:
  -main ===> evolution+base plugins
  -plugins ===> plugins part of the "standard" bundle
This makes more sense than previous tweak and preserves ressources.

* disable the mail-account-disable plugin by default (you can still
enable it from the plugins preferences) ; there is something not
quite right about it that makes right-clicking on a folder very
slow ; it's beeing investigated but for now, evolution is slow
enough...

* fix some hardcoded paths in the antispam plugins

* import 2 patches from pkgsrc and FreeBSD which fixes some obvious
issues

* evolution needs gnome-icon-theme to build

* remove the rpath related stuff from LDFLAGS which prevented
building on macppc ; the plugins link with '-rpath $(plugindir)' so
it should not be needed anymore
please CONTACT ME if you see any regression (in which case bernd@@ can
spank me for free)

@If you intend to run evolution outside of GNOME and don't have a
default icon theme setup, you need to configure one. Add the following
line in ~/.gtkrc-2.0:
  gtk-icon-theme-name="gnome"

@Update to 2.2.3, the latest in the 2.2 tree.

BROKEN!! Committed here so that others may have something to work with.
Also, replaces Evo 1 which was unsupported and well out-of-date.

Setuid note:

If you intend to use Evolution to read local mail-spool mbox files then
you will need to set the setuid bit for the camel-lock-helper program.

You can do this by: 'chmod u+s ${PREFIX}/sbin/camel-lock-helper'

While there are no known security problems at this time with
camel-lock-helper, setting the setuid bit on any program is a
potential security risk.

@Remove the setuid bit from camel-lock-helper, and add a MESSAGE saying so.

Removing the setuid bit will break Evolution's ability to read email only
from the system mail spool.  If you need that functionality the MESSAGE
file tells you how to put the setuid bit back.
