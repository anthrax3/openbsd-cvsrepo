@Update to 2.2.3, the latest in the 2.2 tree.

BROKEN!! Committed here so that others may have something to work with.
Also, replaces Evo 1 which was unsupported and well out-of-date.

log
@* Updated 1.0.7 -> 1.0.8:
        - fixed a number of addressbook and calendar issues
        - updated some translations

* Updated the MASTER_SITES since Evolution is now in the Gnome tree.

* Standardized the CONFIGURE_ARGS.

* The developer's guide made a comeback so a subpackage was created for it.

* Removed the unneeded patch-default_user_Makefile_am patch.

* Patched the OMF file for scrollkeeper 0.3 and implemented better handling of scrollkeeper in general.

* Regenerated some of the remaining patches.

* Removed the remaining Norwegan (?) help files, since they caused problems with scrollkeeper anyway.

* Made the port complain if there's an existing Evolution installation due to numerious library conflicts.

* Updated my email address.
