@Note that for evolution to check incoming messages for junk, the
bogofilter or p5-Mail-SpamAssassin package needs to be installed.
It's configured under "Preferences - Mail Preferences - Junk".

If you intend to run evolution outside of GNOME and don't have a
default icon theme setup, you need to configure one. Add the following
line in ~/.gtkrc-2.0:
  gtk-icon-theme-name="gnome"

@Big spring cleanup:

* split in 2 packages:
  -main ===> evolution+base plugins
  -plugins ===> plugins part of the "standard" bundle
This makes more sense than previous tweak and preserves ressources.

* disable the mail-account-disable plugin by default (you can still
enable it from the plugins preferences) ; there is something not
quite right about it that makes right-clicking on a folder very
slow ; it's beeing investigated but for now, evolution is slow
enough...

* fix some hardcoded paths in the antispam plugins

* import 2 patches from pkgsrc and FreeBSD which fixes some obvious
issues

* evolution needs gnome-icon-theme to build

* remove the rpath related stuff from LDFLAGS which prevented
building on macppc ; the plugins link with '-rpath $(plugindir)' so
it should not be needed anymore
please CONTACT ME if you see any regression (in which case bernd@@ can
spank me for free)

ok jasper@@
