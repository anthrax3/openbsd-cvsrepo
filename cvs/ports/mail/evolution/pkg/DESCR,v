@Update to evolution-3.12.0.
Merge -main and -plugins -- dependencies between the 2 are not different
enough to justify subpackaging.

@Evolution provides integrated mail, addressbook and calendaring
functionality to users of the GNOME desktop.

@Big spring cleanup:

* split in 2 packages:
  -main ===> evolution+base plugins
  -plugins ===> plugins part of the "standard" bundle
This makes more sense than previous tweak and preserves ressources.

* disable the mail-account-disable plugin by default (you can still
enable it from the plugins preferences) ; there is something not
quite right about it that makes right-clicking on a folder very
slow ; it's beeing investigated but for now, evolution is slow
enough...

* fix some hardcoded paths in the antispam plugins

* import 2 patches from pkgsrc and FreeBSD which fixes some obvious
issues

* evolution needs gnome-icon-theme to build

* remove the rpath related stuff from LDFLAGS which prevented
building on macppc ; the plugins link with '-rpath $(plugindir)' so
it should not be needed anymore
please CONTACT ME if you see any regression (in which case bernd@@ can
spank me for free)

The ldap flavor adds support for using LDAP to access corporate
address books and address servers.

Note: Evolution might fail due to a lack of shared memory.  The
simplest workaround is to run Evolution with the --no-xshm flag.
Alternatively, MIT-SHM shared memory use by imlib can be disabled
by turning it off in imlib_config and if necessary you can disable
XFree86 "big font" support to free up additional shared memory by
setting the XF86BIGFONT_DISABLE environment variable.

The shared memory limits can, of course, be globally set in the
kernel via the config(8) command as well.
