BROKEN!! Committed here so that others may have something to work with.
Also, replaces Evo 1 which was unsupported and well out-of-date.

log
@In addition to updating Evolution to 1.2.4, this modifies the pthread
detection scheme in configure to properly handle our -pthread and includes
db-3.1.17 directly into the port, removing the version constraint on the
db port.

This also addresses the CORE security advisory ID CORE-20030304-01.
