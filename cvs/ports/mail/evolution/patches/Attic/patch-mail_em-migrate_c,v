@$OpenBSD: patch-mail_em-migrate_c,v 1.2 2009/10/13 22:07:04 jasper Exp $

from pkgsrc:
Fix permissions of files copied into the user directory from the data
directory, otherwise, the sample Inbox folder is copied with mode 444
and you get multiple warnings from Evolution saying that it can't update
the folder.

1.1
log
@Big spring cleanup:

* split in 2 packages:
  -main ===> evolution+base plugins
  -plugins ===> plugins part of the "standard" bundle
This makes more sense than previous tweak and preserves ressources.

* disable the mail-account-disable plugin by default (you can still
enable it from the plugins preferences) ; there is something not
quite right about it that makes right-clicking on a folder very
slow ; it's beeing investigated but for now, evolution is slow
enough...

* fix some hardcoded paths in the antispam plugins

* import 2 patches from pkgsrc and FreeBSD which fixes some obvious
issues

* evolution needs gnome-icon-theme to build

* remove the rpath related stuff from LDFLAGS which prevented
building on macppc ; the plugins link with '-rpath $(plugindir)' so
it should not be needed anymore
please CONTACT ME if you see any regression (in which case bernd@@ can
spank me for free)

ok jasper@@
