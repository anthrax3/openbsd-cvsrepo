@Perdition is a fully featured POP3 and IMAP4 proxy server. It is able to
handle both SSL and non-SSL connections and redirect users to a real-server
based on a database lookup. Perdition supports modular based database access.
ODBC, MySQL, PostgreSQL, GDBM, POSIX Regular Expression and NIS modules ship
with the distribution. The API for modules is open allowing arbitrary modules
to be written to allow access to any data store.

Perdition has many uses. Including, creating large mail systems where an
end-user's mailbox may be stored on one of several hosts, integrating
different mail systems together, migrating between different email
infrastructures, and bridging plain-text, SSL and TLS services. It can also
be used as part of a firewall.
