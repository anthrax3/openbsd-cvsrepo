@Z-push has been installed into ${INSTDIR}

You should point the followings to the DocumentRoot of your web-server:
    # ln -s ../z-push /var/www/htdocs/z-push
(make sure you use a relative symlink since Apache is chrooted)

With Apache, some non defaults PHP settings are required on the
${INSTDIR} directory. You can configure this as follows:
    # ln -s ${PREFIX}/conf/modules.sample/z-push.conf \
        /var/www/conf/modules

Proceed to complete the configuration by reading:
    ${INSTDIR}/INSTALL
