1.1
log
@Add some bug-fix patches; at this point in the Dovecot release cycle
most work is on 1.1, so it makes sense to add them locally for now.

- If SSL function fails and there are no errors, return "Unknown error"
instead of "Success" as the reason.
- Fixed a memory leak in ACL plugin.
- Send the success reply in one write.
- If remote disconnects, log "Connection closed: reason" just like IMAP does.
- STORE: Ignore flag changes for read-only (especially EXAMINEd) mailboxes.
- random_fill(): If read(/dev/urandom) returned EINTR, it could have written
random data before the given buffer.
- BODY/BODYSTRUCTURE fetch: Don't crash if we already had message parts
parsed.

From Brad, tested on various arch production servers.
