log
@Switch Dovecot to using plugins for ldap/database support. From Brad,
with pkgpath/dependency marker tweaks from myself. Looks good to pea@@.

This means we are now using subpackages rather than flavours; if upgrading
from a flavoured version, you will need to add the relevant module yourself.
e.g.: dovecot-$VER-ldap will be upgraded to dovecot-$VER, you must
pkg_add dovecot-ldap.
