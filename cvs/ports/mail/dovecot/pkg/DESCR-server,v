@Switch Dovecot to using plugins for ldap/database support. From Brad,
with pkgpath/dependency marker tweaks from myself. Looks good to pea@@.

This means we are now using subpackages rather than flavours; if upgrading
from a flavoured version, you will need to add the relevant module yourself.
e.g.: dovecot-$VER-ldap will be upgraded to dovecot-$VER, you must
pkg_add dovecot-ldap.

@Dovecot is an IMAP and POP3 server for Linux/UNIX-like systems, written
with security primarily in mind.  Although it's written in C, it uses
several coding techniques to avoid most of the common pitfalls.  Dovecot
can work with standard mbox and maildir formats and it's fully compatible
with UW-IMAP and Courier IMAP servers as well as mail clients accessing
the mailboxes directly.

         ldap - Build with LDAP support as an authentication source
        mysql - Build with MySQL support as an authentication source
   postgresql - Build with PostgreSQL support as an authentication source
