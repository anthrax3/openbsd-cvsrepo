@This library implements several algorithms related to the Unicode Standard:
* Look up uppercase, lowercase, and titlecase equivalents of a unicode
  character.
* Implementation of grapheme and work breaking rules.
* Implementation of line breaking rules.
* Several ancillary functions, like looking up the unicode character
  that corresponds to some HTML 4.0 entity (such as “&amp;”, for
  example), and determining the normal width or a double-width status of
  a unicode character. Also, an adaptation of the iconv(3) API for this
  unicode library.
