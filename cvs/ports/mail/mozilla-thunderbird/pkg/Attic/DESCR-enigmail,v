@Update to thunderbird 24.4.0.

- See http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/24.4.0/releasenotes/
- Fixes MFSA-2014-15->17,26->32
- Remove enigmail subpackage, build goo & patches, will be
  superseded by mail/enigmail,-main
- add an all-openbsd.js file to customize default preferences and
  install it in defaults/pref/. Use it to set
extensions.autoDisableScopes to 3, so that extensions installed in
${LOCALBASE}/lib/mozilla/extensions/${APPID} are enabled by default.
- remove patch-mailnews_base_search_src_nsMsgSearchTerm_cpp, merged in
  #885538

@Merge enigmail/thunderbird port into thunderbird port so that enigmail
is built during thunderbird build, and packaged as a subpackage of
thunderbird, instead of building thunderbird twice...
add @@conflict/@@pkgpath markers to allow seamless updates from previous
enigmail packages.
Tested by nigel@@, ok naddy@@.
