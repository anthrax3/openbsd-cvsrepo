##################################################
#                The Exim Monitor                #
##################################################

# This is the template for the Exim monitor's main build-time configuration
# file. It contains settings that are independent of any operating system. It
# should be edited and then saved to a file called Local/eximon.conf before
# running the make command to build the monitor, if any settings are required.
# Local/eximon.conf can be empty if no changes are needed. The examples given
# here (commented out) are the default settings.

# Any settings made in the configuration file can be overridden at run time
# by setting up an environment variable with the same name as any of these
# options, but preceded by EXIMON_, for example, EXIMON_WINDOW_TITLE.


##################################################################
#      Set these variables as appropriate for your system        #
##################################################################

# The qualifying name for your domain. The only use made of this is for
# testing that certain addresses are the same when displaying the
# log tail, and for shortening sender addresses in the queue display.

# QUALIFY_DOMAIN=

# The default minimum width and height for the whole window are 103 and
# 162 pixels respectively. This is enough to hold the left-most stripchart
# and the quit button. The values can be changed here.

# MIN_HEIGHT=162
# MIN_WIDTH=103

# If you uncomment the following setting, the window will start up at
# its minimum size, instead of the default maximum. There may be a quick
# flash during the start-up process. Defining it this way allows it to be
# overridden by an environment variable.

# START_SMALL=${EXIMON_START_SMALL-yes}

# The title for eximon's main display window. It is possible to have
# host name of the machine you are running on substituted into the
# title string. If you include the string ${fullhostname} then the
# complete name is used. If you include ${hostname} then the full
# host name will have the string contained in the DOMAIN variable
# stripped from its right-hand end before being substituted. Any other
# shell or environment variables may also be included.

# If you use any substitutions, remember to ensure that the $ and {}
# characters are escaped from the shell, e.g. by using single quotes.

# WINDOW_TITLE="${hostname} eximon"

# The domain that you want to be stripped from the machine's full hostname
# when forming the short host name for the eximon window title, as
# described above.

# DOMAIN=

# Parameters for the rolling display of the tail of the exim log file.
# The width and depth are measured in pixels; LOG_BUFFER specifies the
# amount of store to set aside for holding the log tail, which is displayed
# in a scrolling window. When this store is full, the earlier 50% of it
# is discarded - this is much more efficient that throwing it away line
# by line. The number given can be followed by the letter K to indicate
# that the value is in kilobytes. A minimum value of 1K is enforced.

# LOG_DEPTH=300
# LOG_WIDTH=950
# LOG_BUFFER=20K

# The font which is used in the log tail display. This is defined in
# the normal X manner. It must be a "character cell" font, because this
# is required by the text widget.

# LOG_FONT=-misc-fixed-medium-r-normal-*-14-140-*-*-*-*-iso8859-1

# Parameters for the display of message that are on the exim queue.
# The width and depth are measured in pixels.

# QUEUE_DEPTH=200
# QUEUE_WIDTH=950

# The font which is used in the queue display.

# QUEUE_FONT=$LOG_FONT

# When a message has more than one undelivered address, they are listed
# one below the other. A limit can be placed on the number of addresses
# displayed for any one message. If there are more, then "..." is used
# to indicate this.

# QUEUE_MAX_ADDRESSES=10

# The display of the contents of the queue is updated every QUEUE_INTERVAL
# seconds by default (there is a button to request update).

# QUEUE_INTERVAL=300

# The size of the popup text window that is used for looking at the
# contents of messages, etc.

# TEXT_DEPTH=200

# The keystroke/mouse-operation that is used to pop up the menu in the
# queue window is configurable. The default is Shift with the lefthand
# mouse button. The name of an alternative can be specified in the standard
# X way of naming these things. With the default configuration for the monitor,
# individuals can override this by setting the EXIMON_MENU_EVENT environment
# variable.

# MENU_EVENT='Shift<Btn1Down>'

# When the menu is used to perform an operation on a message, the result of the
# operation is normally visible in the log window, so Eximon doesn't display
# the output of the generated Exim command. However, you can request that
# this output be shown in a separate window by setting ACTION_OUTPUT to "yes".
# This does not apply to the output generated from attempting to deliver a
# message, which is always shown.

# ACTION_OUTPUT=no

# When some action is taken on a message, such as freezing it, or changing
# its recipients, the queue display is normally automatically updated. On
# systems that have very large queues, this can take some time and be dis-
# tracting. If this option is set to "no", the queue display is no longer
# automatically updated after an action is applied to a message.

# ACTION_QUEUE_UPDATE=yes

# When the menu item to display a message's body is invoked, the amount
# of data is limited to BODY_MAX bytes. This limit is a safety precaution
# to save the screen scrolling for ever on an enormous message.

# BODY_MAX=20000

# The stripcharts are updated every STRIPCHART_INTERVAL seconds.

# STRIPCHART_INTERVAL=60

# A stripchart showing the count of messages in the queue is always
# displayed on the left of eximon's window. Its name is "queue" by
# default, but can be changed by this variable.

# QUEUE_STRIPCHART_NAME=queue

# The following variable may be set to the name of a disc partition. If
# it is, a stripchart showing the percentage fullness of the partition
# will be displayed as the second stripchart. This can be used to keep
# a display of a mail spool partition on the screen.

# SIZE_STRIPCHART=/var/mail

# The name of the size stripchart will be the last component of SIZE_STRIPCHART
# unless the following variable is set to override it.

# SIZE_STRIPCHART_NAME=space

# The following variable contains a specification of which stripcharts
# you want eximon to display based on log entries. The string consists of
# pairs of strings, delimited by slash characters. The first string in each
# pair is a regular expression that matches some distinguishing feature in a
# exim log entry.

# Entries that match the expression will be counted and displayed in a
# stripchart whose title is given by the second string. The string may
# be continued over several input lines, provided that it is split
# after a slash, and an additional slash (optionally preceded by white
# space) is included at the start of the continuation line.

# Stripcharts configured by the following parameter are displayed to the
# right of the queue and size stripcharts, in the order defined here.

# LOG_STRIPCHARTS='/ <= /in/
#                  / => /out/
#                  / => .+ R=local/local/
#                  / => .+ T=[^ ]*smtp/smtp/'

@Update to exim 4.41.

This is a major update and configuration files are not compatible.
A conversion script is included and installed in

        ${PREFIX}/share/examples/exim4/convert4r4

New co-maintainer and much of the inital work done by Ilya Voronin.

A decision was made to include the semi-official exiscan patch in
the default installation, as most admins appear to use this. It is
hoped that is will become part of the core exim4 code "soon".

This port now creates an _exim user and group if they don't already
exist.

Work and testing by Ilya Voronin, Richard Welty, Axel Rau and others
who I can't now find in my mailbox. Apologies if I left you out.

@Update exim to version 3.12

* Version 2.12 is no longer available on the primary or mirror sites

o The configuration file format has changed. For those upgrading,
  please see the documentation and consider using the upgrade script to
  help automate the config files change. This upgrade script is built as
  part of the source, but *not* installed - as it should only be needed
  once.

o The X11 eximon program will be built with this port/package - this
  assumes that X is installed. Would someone with more ports
  experience consider helping me here and writing the right kind of
  Makefile check to see if files/eximon.conf should be copied to the
  build directories.

o Perl support is included as standard as is support for additional
  mail delivery formats. These are not the default in vanilla exim 3.12

o Finally, another plea for help. This port does not make as usuable
  package, as I could not get support for the creation of a config file
  working. I intend to look at this further, but as the old version was
  completely useless, I felt it was better to get this in the tree
  sooner rather than later.

# The regular expression syntax supported by eximon is as follows:

# A regular expression is zero or more branches, separated by `|'. It
# matches anything that matches one of the branches. A branch is zero or
# more pieces, concatenated. It matches a match for the first, followed by
# a match for the second, etc. A piece is an atom possibly followed by
# `*', `+', or `?'.
#
# An atom followed by `*' matches a sequence of 0 or more matches of the atom.
# An atom followed by `+' matches a sequence of 1 or more matches of the atom.
# An atom followed by `?' matches a match of the atom, or the null string.
#
# An atom is a regular expression in parentheses (matching a match for the
# regular expression), a range (see below), `.' (matching any single
# character), `^' (matching the null string at the beginning of the input
# string), `$' (matching the null string at the end of the input string),
# a `\' followed by a single character (matching that character), or a
# single character with no other significance (matching that character).
#
# A range is a sequence of characters enclosed in `[]'. It normally
# matches any single character from the sequence. If the sequence begins
# with `^', it matches any single character not from the rest of the
# sequence. If two characters in the sequence are separated by `-', this
# is shorthand for the full list of ASCII characters between them (e.g.
# `[0-9]' matches any decimal digit). To include a literal `]' in the
# sequence, make it the first character (following a possible `^'). To
# include a literal `-', make it the first or last character.

# A stripchart showing the count of messages in the queue is always
# displayed on the left of eximon's window. Stripcharts configured
# by this parameter are displayed to its right, in the order defined
# here.
