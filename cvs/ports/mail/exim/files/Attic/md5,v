1.13
log
@From the ChangeLog:

Version 3.34
------------
1. Exim was failing to diagnose a lone \ at the end of an expansion string as
an error (basically a typo in the code).

2. If logging was only to syslog, and Exim was trying to panic-die, it crashed
instead of dying cleanly.

3. If an address was routed using a DNS lookup that found no MX records, but
one or more A records, and fallback hosts were specified on the transport, the
fallback hosts were ignored.

4. $message_body_size was set incorrectly (to zero) during filter testing.

5. Ensure the configuration file is closed before running the -bi command.

6. Reap all complete processes within the loop for accepting -bs or -bS
messages, because it seems that not all OS do this automatically when SIGCHLD
is set to SIG_IGN.

7. Reset SIGHUP to SIG_IGN before restarting a daemon, in case another SIGHUP
arrives very quickly and kills the newly started Exim before it has a chance to
get going.

8. After "452 space shortage", was not unsetting the sender address. Could lead
to strange effects when the client was pipelining.

9. There was no check that getpeername() was giving a socket address when
called on stdin passed from a previous delivery.

10. If a local part beginning with a pipe symbol was directed to a pipe
transport, the transport got confused as to which command it should run.
This could be a security exposure if unchecked local parts are directed
or routed to pipe transports.

@Update exim to version 3.20

See ChangeLog and documentation for a full list of bugs fixes and
new features. Release highlights include the addition of STARTTLS
extensions to SMTP and callback SMTP checks to verify sender addresses
on lightly loaded mail servers - prevent spam from made-up addresses.

This port includes the following flavors:

no_x11	- do not build eximon which requires X11
no_perl	- do not include perl support
no_tls	- do not include SSL/TLS support
mysql	- support mysql queries for lookups
pgsql	- support pgsql queries for lookups
ldap	- support ldap (OpenLDAP) queries for lookups

All these queries are independent.

Maintainer has been temporarily chaged to me for feedback, until
Sebastian is back and available to support the port.

Testing has been limited to i386.

@update to exim 3.14, ok turan

* bug fixes and new features release
* fix a tempnam() usage in the patch

No fake or flavours support - this may get done if I learn enough,
quickly enough. Will not build as a real package just now. Working on
it.

@Update exim to version 3.12

* Version 2.12 is no longer available on the primary or mirror sites

o The configuration file format has changed. For those upgrading,
  please see the documentation and consider using the upgrade script to
  help automate the config files change. This upgrade script is built as
  part of the source, but *not* installed - as it should only be needed
  once.

o The X11 eximon program will be built with this port/package - this
  assumes that X is installed. Would someone with more ports
  experience consider helping me here and writing the right kind of
  Makefile check to see if files/eximon.conf should be copied to the
  build directories.

o Perl support is included as standard as is support for additional
  mail delivery formats. These are not the default in vanilla exim 3.12

o Finally, another plea for help. This port does not make as usuable
  package, as I could not get support for the creation of a config file
  working. I intend to look at this further, but as the old version was
  completely useless, I felt it was better to get this in the tree
  sooner rather than later.
