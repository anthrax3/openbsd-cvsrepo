- tweak MESSAGE/DESCR
- drop no_x11 flavour in favour of an -eximon subpackage and a
pseudo-flavour to disable it
- use iconv by default rather than as a flavour

@Exim is a mail transfer agent (MTA) for hosts that are running Unix or Unix-
like operating systems. It was designed on the assumption that it would be run
on hosts that are permanently connected to the Internet. However, it can
be used on intermittently connected hosts with suitable configuration
adjustments.

This port can be built with the following flavors:

* no_exiscan		- do not build content scanning into the exim4
                          ACL system.
* no_x11		- do not build eximon which requires X11
* mysql			- support mysql queries for lookups
* postgresql		- support postgresql queries for lookups
* sqlite3		- support for sqlite queries for lookups
* ldap			- support ldap (OpenLDAP) queries for lookups
* iconv			- support character code conversions
* sasl			- support for SASL

All these flavors are independent of each other.

@Update to exim 4.41.

This is a major update and configuration files are not compatible.
A conversion script is included and installed in

        ${PREFIX}/share/examples/exim4/convert4r4

New co-maintainer and much of the inital work done by Ilya Voronin.

A decision was made to include the semi-official exiscan patch in
the default installation, as most admins appear to use this. It is
hoped that is will become part of the core exim4 code "soon".

This port now creates an _exim user and group if they don't already
exist.

Work and testing by Ilya Voronin, Richard Welty, Axel Rau and others
who I can't now find in my mailbox. Apologies if I left you out.

Exim is a mail transfer agent (MTA) developed at the University of
Cambridge for use on Unix systems connected to the Internet. It is
freely available under the terms of the GNU General Public Licence.
In overall style it is similar to Smail 3, but its facilities are
more extensive. It contains facilities for verifying incoming sender
and recipient addresses, for refusing mail from specified hosts,
networks, or senders, and for controlling mail relaying. This version
also supports the STARTTLS extension.

@Update exim to version 3.20

See ChangeLog and documentation for a full list of bugs fixes and
new features. Release highlights include the addition of STARTTLS
extensions to SMTP and callback SMTP checks to verify sender addresses
on lightly loaded mail servers - prevent spam from made-up addresses.

This port includes the following flavors:

no_x11	- do not build eximon which requires X11
no_perl	- do not include perl support
no_tls	- do not include SSL/TLS support
mysql	- support mysql queries for lookups
pgsql	- support pgsql queries for lookups
ldap	- support ldap (OpenLDAP) queries for lookups

All these queries are independent.

Maintainer has been temporarily chaged to me for feedback, until
Sebastian is back and available to support the port.

Testing has been limited to i386.

@Update exim to version 3.12

* Version 2.12 is no longer available on the primary or mirror sites

o The configuration file format has changed. For those upgrading,
  please see the documentation and consider using the upgrade script to
  help automate the config files change. This upgrade script is built as
  part of the source, but *not* installed - as it should only be needed
  once.

o The X11 eximon program will be built with this port/package - this
  assumes that X is installed. Would someone with more ports
  experience consider helping me here and writing the right kind of
  Makefile check to see if files/eximon.conf should be copied to the
  build directories.

o Perl support is included as standard as is support for additional
  mail delivery formats. These are not the default in vanilla exim 3.12

o Finally, another plea for help. This port does not make as usuable
  package, as I could not get support for the creation of a config file
  working. I intend to look at this further, but as the old version was
  completely useless, I felt it was better to get this in the tree
  sooner rather than later.

Exim is a mail transfer agent for Unix systems connected to the Internet.

 .   Exim is intended for use as an Internet mailer, and therefore handles
     addresses in RFC 822 domain format only. (No bangpaths!)

 .   The only external transport currently implemented is an SMTP transport
     over a TCP/IP network (using sockets). A pipe transport is available,
     and this could be used to send messages to some other transport mechanism.

 .   Exim is very configurable, and its management is very powerful. It can
     be configured to be "fussy" about certain hosts or domains, and
     can easily serve multiple domains.

 .   Exim is an excellent mailer for an ISP, as its control and flexibility
     are very good.

 .   Its requeuing and retry algorithms are very powerful.
