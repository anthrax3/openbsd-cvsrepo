@Update exim to version 3.12

* Version 2.12 is no longer available on the primary or mirror sites

o The configuration file format has changed. For those upgrading,
  please see the documentation and consider using the upgrade script to
  help automate the config files change. This upgrade script is built as
  part of the source, but *not* installed - as it should only be needed
  once.

o The X11 eximon program will be built with this port/package - this
  assumes that X is installed. Would someone with more ports
  experience consider helping me here and writing the right kind of
  Makefile check to see if files/eximon.conf should be copied to the
  build directories.

o Perl support is included as standard as is support for additional
  mail delivery formats. These are not the default in vanilla exim 3.12

o Finally, another plea for help. This port does not make as usuable
  package, as I could not get support for the creation of a config file
  working. I intend to look at this further, but as the old version was
  completely useless, I felt it was better to get this in the tree
  sooner rather than later.
