EXIM is installed. You must now edit /etc/exim/configure
and set the correct values for your system.

It is strongly advised that you configure exim to use
a UID and GID other that 0/0. You can do this by adding
lines to the configure file like this:

\texim_user = "nobody"
\texim_group = "nogroup"

but you must remember to allow that user write
permissions to /var/log/exim and /var/spool/exim
