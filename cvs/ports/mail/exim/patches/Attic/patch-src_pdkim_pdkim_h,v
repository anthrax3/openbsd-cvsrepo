@SECURITY fix for Exim CVE-2012-5671 - Remote code execution with DKIM decoding

Workaround: "You are not vulnerable if <...> you put this at the start
of an ACL plumbed into acl_smtp_connect or acl_smtp_rcpt:

  warn control = dkim_disable_verify"

This is backported from the diff between exim 4.80 and 4.80.1
(not updating fully to 4.80.1 yet as this small diff is safer to commit)
