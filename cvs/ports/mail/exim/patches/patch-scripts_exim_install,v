@security update to exim-4.88, changelog includes

JH/27 Fix a possible security hole, wherein a process operating with the Exim
      UID can gain a root shell.  Credit to http://www.halfdog.net/ for
      discovery and writeup.  Ubuntu bug 1580454; no bug raised against Exim
      itself :(

JH/34 SECURITY: Use proper copy of DATA command in error message.
      Could leak key material.  Remotely explaoitable.  CVE-2016-9963.

whoever decided to have an embargo period ending on 25 December: this was
not a particularly good idea

log
@Update to exim 4.41.

This is a major update and configuration files are not compatible.
A conversion script is included and installed in

        ${PREFIX}/share/examples/exim4/convert4r4

New co-maintainer and much of the inital work done by Ilya Voronin.

A decision was made to include the semi-official exiscan patch in
the default installation, as most admins appear to use this. It is
hoped that is will become part of the core exim4 code "soon".

This port now creates an _exim user and group if they don't already
exist.

Work and testing by Ilya Voronin, Richard Welty, Axel Rau and others
who I can't now find in my mailbox. Apologies if I left you out.
