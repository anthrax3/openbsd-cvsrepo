@The ipop2d, ipop3d, and imapd daemons should be invoked by your
/etc/inetd.conf file with lines such as:

  pop2    stream  tcp     nowait  root    ${PREFIX}/libexec/ipop2d   ipop2d
  pop2    stream  tcp6    nowait  root    ${PREFIX}/libexec/ipop2d   ipop2d
  pop3    stream  tcp     nowait  root    ${PREFIX}/libexec/ipop3d   ipop3d
  pop3    stream  tcp6    nowait  root    ${PREFIX}/libexec/ipop3d   ipop3d
  imap    stream  tcp     nowait  root    ${PREFIX}/libexec/imapd    imapd
  imap    stream  tcp6    nowait  root    ${PREFIX}/libexec/imapd    imapd


To use SSL as default transport you need to add the lines below to
/etc/inetd.conf.

  pop3s   stream  tcp     nowait  root    ${PREFIX}/libexec/ipop3d   ipop3d
  pop3s   stream  tcp6    nowait  root    ${PREFIX}/libexec/ipop3d   ipop3d
  imaps   stream  tcp     nowait  root    ${PREFIX}/libexec/imapd    imapd
  imaps   stream  tcp6    nowait  root    ${PREFIX}/libexec/imapd    imapd

You also need to install files containing RSA certificates to
/etc/ssl/{imapd,ipop3d}.pem and files containing the corresponding private
keys to /etc/ssl/private/{imapd,ipop3d}.pem.  See ssl(8) for how to do this.
