@Remove claws-mail-clamav plugin, for numerous reasons :
- it is broken with latest claws-mail release, and no fix is available.
- it is not officially maintained anymore upstream.
- due to licence issues with libclamav (now GPLv2 only, claws-mail is
GPLv3+), upstream devs of claws-mail stated that this plugin was 'illegal'.
See claws-mail website for more information.
- i don't want to handle licence issues like this.

Discussed with and 'be a man. make a decision and stand to it.' mbalmer@@
