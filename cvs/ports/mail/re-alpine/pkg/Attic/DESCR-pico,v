@Pico is a simple, display-oriented text editor based on the Alpine
message system composer.  As with Alpine, commands are displayed at the
bottom of the screen, and context-sensitive help is provided.  As
characters are typed they are immediately inserted into the text.

This package is built using the re-alpine source, the continuation of
the Alpine email client from University of Washington.
