| Running ${FULLPKGNAME} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Below is a quick start guide to show how to set up Alpine to use IMAP or
POP3 for accessing your email and SMTP for sending email.

IMAP
====

1. Make sure your email provider has IMAP support enabled (some
providers require you to explicitly enable IMAP support).

2. From alpine's main screen enter (S)etup, collection(L)ists, and
press (A) to add a new collection

3. Fill in the fields as follows:

    Nickname: Example
    Server:   imap.example.com/qualifier/user=user@@example.com

where:
    - imap.example.com is the fully qualified server name
    - qualifier is something like ssl or tls (add /novalidate-cert when
      using a self-signed certificate)
    - user@@example.com is your email address

As a concrete example, here's how this would look for gmail:
    imap.gmail.com/ssl/user=yourname@@gmail.com

4. Press Ctrl-X to exit and save, enter your password when prompted and
(E)xit back to the main screen.

POP3
====

1. Follow the same instructions as above for IMAP, except for step 3
Use the following:

    Nickname: Example
    Server:   pop.example.com:port/qualifier/user=username@@example.com

where:
    - pop.example.com is the fully qualified server name
    - qualifier is something like pop3, ssl... (add /novalidate-cert
      when using a self-signed certificate)
    - user@@example.com is your email address

As a concrete example, here's how this would look for gmail:
    pop.gmail.com:995/novalidate-cert/user=yourname@@gmail.com/pop3/ssl

SMTP
====

1. Make sure you are back at alpine's main screen.

2. Enter (S)etup, (C)onfig

3. Modify the setting for "SMTP Server (for sending)" as follows:

    smtp.example.com:port/qualifier/user=user@@example.com

where:
    - smtp.example.com is the fully qualified server name
    - port is the smtp server port
    - qualifier is something like ssl or tls (add /novalidate-cert when
      using a self-signed certificate)
    - user@@example.com is your email address

  As a concrete example, here's how this would look for gmail:
       smtp.gmail.com:587/tls/user=yourname@@gmail.com
