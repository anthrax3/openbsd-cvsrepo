@Change default configuration options

  which_access open -> closed
  who_access open -> closed
  max_which_hits 0 -> 1

Those would allow a spammer to harvest all subscriber addresses
if not changed by the list admin. Reported on

http://online.securityfocus.com/archive/1/310113/2003-02-03/2003-02-09/0

Don't restrict the which arguments as the article suggests, though,
because with which_access list and max_which_hits 1, there's no
reason to destroy a useful command.
