@You can disable this module by removing the
${PREFIX}/conf/php5/mailparse.ini symbolic link by
issuing the following command: 

rm -f ${PREFIX}/conf/php5/mailparse.ini

If you already have Apache running on your machine,
you should not use "apachectl restart" - instead,
you should fully stop and then restart the server.

@import pecl-mailparse.

Mailparse is a PHP extension for parsing and working with
plain and MIME compliant email messages. It is stream based,
so does not keep in-memory copies of the files it processes,
lowering resource use with large messages.
