1.1
log
@Roundcube forces its own error_reporting options; adjust the mask to avoid
reporting E_DEPRECATED messages as there is a deprecation warning with Net_SMTP
that is unfixed upstream resulting in a lot of noise in roundcube's error log
for each sent message.

1.1.4.1
log
@MFC update to roundcubemail-1.1.4, fixes potential path traversal vulnerability
https://www.htbridge.com/advisory/HTB23283 "Although the vulnerability is not
fully disclosed yet, the attack scenario requires an active Roundcube account
as well as write privileges on the same host Roundcube is served from (without
open_basedir protection)." Also adds protection against brute-force attacks.
