@With Apache, AllowOverride settings are required on the ${INSTDIR}
directory. You can configure this as follows:

# ln -s ${PREFIX}/conf/modules.sample/roundcubemail.conf \

# /etc/rc.d/httpd restart

Next, follow ${INSTDIR}/INSTALL or ${INSTDIR}/UPGRADING

Make the roundcubemail directory available to your web users, either
by adding a separate virtual host, or an alias in an appropriate part
of the web-server's configuration, e.g.:

Alias /roundcubemail/ "/var/www/roundcubemail/"

@- setting suhosin.session.encrypt per-dir doesn't seem to work
(even with suhosin.perdir set), so just force it in roundcubemail.conf
and remove the program/include/iniset.php patch.

- adjust permissions so the web-based installer can be used as pointed
out by aja, this used to be dangerous but is now controlled by the main
config file and defaults to 'off'.

@- update to an svn snapshot of roundcube, it has numerous fixes over the

Proceed to complete the installation or upgrade by reading:

A database is required to use this package; PostgreSQL, MySQL and
SQLite are supported. If you have no requirements for either of the
full-scale RDBMS, you might like to install the php5-sqlite package.
