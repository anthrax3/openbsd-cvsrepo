@qmailanalog is a collection of tools to help you analyze qmail-send's
activity record. It supplies statistics to answer a wide variety of
questions:

   * overall: how many messages? recipients? attempts? etc.

   * ddist: how soon were 50% of the messages delivered? 90%? 95%? 99%?

   * rxdelay: what's the best order of recipients for mailing lists?

   * recipients, rhosts: who's getting mail? bytes? messages? attempts?

   * successes, failures, deferrals: why? how often? how much delay?

   * senders, suids: messages? bytes? load? recipients? attempts? delay?

qmailanalog also includes several tools to focus attention on particular
senders, recipients, or messages.
