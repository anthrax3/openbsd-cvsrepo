@To use kpoppassd, you must add the following lines
to /etc/services:

    poppassd	106/tcp # Eudora compatible password Server

and to /etc/inetd.conf:

    127.0.0.1:poppassd stream tcp nowait root \
        ${PREFIX}/libexec/kpoppassd kpoppassd

Then, you must (re)start inetd as root.
kpoppassd uses the LOG_LOCAL4 syslog facility for logging.

kpoppassd is a kerberos password changing daemon that behaves like
poppassd. It allows a user to change his/her password remotely without
having to login. This is particularly useful for webmail systems that
use imap (i.e. horde/imp). The daemon works exactly like the original
poppassd. The only difference being that this poppassd changes a user's
Kerberos 5 password.
