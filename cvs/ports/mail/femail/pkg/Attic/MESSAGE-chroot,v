@By default, femail will use `localhost' for smtphost.  Make sure to
review FAQ Section 10.16 discussing name resolution with httpd(8)'s
default chroot(2).

Additionally, one may create a custom femail.conf; see femail(8).

If you're using femail with PHP inside a chroot jail, be aware that
PHP's built-in "mail" function uses popen(), which requires /bin/sh.

@add a note to MESSAGE-chroot explaining that the php mail function needs
/bin/sh. helps avoid hair-pulling and wasting a whole bunch of time...

@- add note to point -chroot users to FAQ regarding name resolution.
- make -chroot subpackage depend on -main so we get a manpage.
- take MAINTAINER (requested by previous MAINTAINER).
- add @@bin markers while here.
