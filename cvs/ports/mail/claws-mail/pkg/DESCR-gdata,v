log
@Assorted fixes prompted by naddy@@:

- add a -gdata subpackage for the plugin interacting with google
  contacts, since it picks up libgdata if present.
- add libnotify & libcanberra-gtk to LDEP-main since they're picked up
  for the notification plugin if present.
- tidy WANTLIB, put the krb5 & friends only once in WANTLIB.
- remove a leftover empty WANTLIB-docs
- cleanup WANTLIB-* in the ldap FLAVOR, they made no sense

@This plugin provides an interface to Google services. Currently, the
only implemented functionality is to include Google Contacts in the
Tab-address completion.
