@Rework completely.

- disable useless static plugins
- remove unnecessary pseudo flavors
- build pgp and aspell support by default
- install tools and scripts
- shorter DESCRs for plugins

Should be ready now, but more testing is welcome.

Input from Brad, Ulrich (maintainer), espie@@ and steven@@.

ok steven@@

@Import claws-mail 2.8.1, a many-featured mail and news reader.
