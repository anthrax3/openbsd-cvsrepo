@Remove -dillo subpackage, claws devs don't plan to support dillo2, and
claws-mail-htmlviewer plugin is far better anyway.

@Rework completely.

- disable useless static plugins
- remove unnecessary pseudo flavors
- build pgp and aspell support by default
- install tools and scripts
- shorter DESCRs for plugins

Should be ready now, but more testing is welcome.

Claws Mail is an email client (and news reader), based on GTK+, featuring

    Quick response
    Graceful, and sophisticated interface
    Easy configuration, intuitive operation
    Abundant features
    Extensibility

The appearance and interface are designed to be familiar to new users
coming from other popular email clients, as well as experienced users. 
Almost all commands are accessible with the keyboard.

The messages are managed in the standard MH format, which features fast 
access and data security. You'll be able to import your emails from almost 
any other email client, and export them just as easily.

Lots of extra functionality, like an RSS aggregator, calendar, or 
laptop LED handling, are provided by extra plugins.

Claws Mail is distributed under the GPL.

on ports@@.  Not quite finished, but with this many contributers, it's
nice to have some version control.
