@Update to claws-mail 3.3.0, from Ulrich Kahl (maintainer) with some tweaks
by me to clean/reorder LIB_DEPENDS/WANTLIB. Remove two integrated patches.
clamav plugin is not part of it anymore due to licence issues, it will be
reimported soon in a standalone port.

Tested too by Pierre-Emmanuel Andre @@i386, thanks !

@Rework completely.

- disable useless static plugins
- remove unnecessary pseudo flavors
- build pgp and aspell support by default
- install tools and scripts
- shorter DESCRs for plugins

Should be ready now, but more testing is welcome.

Input from Brad, Ulrich (maintainer), espie@@ and steven@@.

@Import claws-mail 2.8.1, a many-featured mail and news reader.

From Ulrich Kahl, with work by pyr@@, brad, myself and various people
on ports@@.  Not quite finished, but with this many contributers, it's
nice to have some version control.

ok pvalchev
