@remove the compface flavour from claws-mail, it wasn't built in bulk builds
anyway and mmcc is going on a ports terminator rampage. original diff from
mmcc, I did the awkward @@pkgpath bits.

ok landry and Daniel Jakots (maintainer, who spotted that my further attempt
at cleanup in post-install was broken)

1.1
log
@Update to claws-mail 3.9.2.

- all the plugins which were distributed separately are now bundled in.
- @@conflict/@@pkgpath markers added for upgrade path.
- add a pdfviewer plugin using poppler
- replace the dead gtkhtml2-based htmlviewer plugin by one using webkit.
- given the deps, pdfviewer and htmlviewer are subpackages.
- remove BDEP on libgcrypt, shouldnt be needed with gnutls >= 2.11.
- remove patches merged upstream.

From Ido Admon, thanks!
