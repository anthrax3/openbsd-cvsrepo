@Update to claws-mail 3.3.0, from Ulrich Kahl (maintainer) with some tweaks
by me to clean/reorder LIB_DEPENDS/WANTLIB. Remove two integrated patches.
clamav plugin is not part of it anymore due to licence issues, it will be
reimported soon in a standalone port.

Tested too by Pierre-Emmanuel Andre @@i386, thanks !
