VMailMgr (short for Virtual MAIL ManaGeR) is a package of programs
designed to manage multiple domains of mail addresses and mailboxes
on a single host. It co-operates with qmail for mail delivery
and program control. It features:

* A password checking interface between qmail-popup and qmail-pop3d
which replaces the usual checkpassword, as well as an authentication
module for [15]Courier IMAP, that provide access to the virtual
mailboxes by one of three methods:

 + IP-based virtual server access (invisible to the POP3 user)
 + username-based access (username-virtualuser)
 + hostname-based access (virtualuser@@virtual.host or
   virtualuser:virtual.host)

* CDB-based password tables to speed up access for domains of any
size.

* Tools to setup a virtual domain, add and delete individual virtual
users and aliases, and to change passwords.

* CGI programs to accomplish the above tasks from a set of web
pages.

* A native PHP library to compliment or replace the CGIs.

* A daemon process that securely directs the operation of the CGIs
and PHP code.

* A separate delivery agent that automatically deals with any address
inside a virtual domain from a single .qmail-default file.
