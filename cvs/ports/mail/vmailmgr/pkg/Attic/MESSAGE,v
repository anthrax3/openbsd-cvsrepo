@==============================================================
Documentation in text and HTML format has been installed to
${PREFIX}/share/doc/vmailmgr - read this now!

You can also find a set of PHP classes for interfacing to 
VMailMgr, and example run scripts for use with daemontools
in ${PREFIX}/share/examples/vmailmgr

An authentication module for Courier-IMAP (mail/courier-imap)
has also been installed.  To use this, add the 'authvmailmgr'
authentication module to the Courier-IMAP configuration files.

VMailMgr (short for Virtual MAIL ManaGeR) is a package of programs
designed to manage multiple domains of mail addresses and mailboxes
on a single host. It co-operates with qmail for mail delivery
and program control. It features:

* A password checking interface between qmail-popup and qmail-pop3d
which replaces the usual checkpassword, as well as an authentication
module for [15]Courier IMAP, that provide access to the virtual
mailboxes by one of three methods:

 + IP-based virtual server access (invisible to the POP3 user)
 + username-based access (username-virtualuser)
 + hostname-based access (virtualuser@@virtual.host or
   virtualuser:virtual.host)

* CDB-based password tables to speed up access for domains of any
size.

* Tools to setup a virtual domain, add and delete individual virtual
users and aliases, and to change passwords.

* CGI programs to accomplish the above tasks from a set of web
pages.

* A native PHP library to compliment or replace the CGIs.

* A daemon process that securely directs the operation of the CGIs
and PHP code.

* A separate delivery agent that automatically deals with any address
inside a virtual domain from a single .qmail-default file.
