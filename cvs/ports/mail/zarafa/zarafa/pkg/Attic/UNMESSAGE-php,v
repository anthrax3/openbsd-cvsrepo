@Import zarafa-6.20.1 (+php5-mapi-6.20.1)

-main
Zarafa is a full-featured e-mail and groupware solution, focused
towards clients using the MAPI standard.  As an MS Exchange replacement,
the Zarafa suite provides the following features:
 * Integration with existing Unix mailserver
 * Native mobile phone support
 * MS Outlook "Look & Feel" webaccess
 * Stable MS Outlook sharing (100% MAPI)

This package provides the Open Source version of Zarafa.

-php
Messaging Application Programming Interface (MAPI) is a messaging
architecture and a Component Object Model based API for Microsoft
Windows. MAPI allows client programs to become (e-mail)
messaging-enabled, -aware, or -based by calling MAPI subsystem routines
that interface with certain messaging servers. While MAPI is designed to
be independent of the protocol, it is usually used with MAPI/RPC, the
proprietary protocol that Microsoft Outlook uses to communicate with
Microsoft Exchange.

These functions allow you to access a MAPI compliant email server.
