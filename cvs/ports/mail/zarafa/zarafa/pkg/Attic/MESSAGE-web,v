@Merge MESSAGE into README.OpenBSD so that all the info is in one place.

@Zarafa webaccess has been installed under
${INSTDIR}

You should point the followings to the DocumentRoot of your web-server:
   # ln -s ../zarafa-webaccess ${PREFIX}/htdocs/webaccess
(make sure you use a relative symlink since Apache is chrooted)

You need to edit the config.php file installed under:
${INSTDIR} for regular web client access

With Apache, this directory should be granted these:
    AllowOverride Indexes Options

If you want to debug the webaccess, copy the following file
   ${INSTDIR}/debug.php.disabled
to
   ${INSTDIR}/debug.php
The debugging output will then be available under:
   ${INSTDIR}/debug.txt

You can enable the PHP mapi module by creating a symbolic
link from ${PREFIX-web}/conf/php5.sample/${MODULE_NAME}.ini to
${PREFIX-web}/conf/php5/${MODULE_NAME}.ini:

ln -fs ${PREFIX-web}/conf/php5.sample/${MODULE_NAME}.ini \
    ${PREFIX-web}/conf/php5/${MODULE_NAME}.ini
