@Update to dspam 3.10.2.

- remove 6 out of the 10 flavors maze, only keep the ones that make
  sense (ie clamav, ldap, domainscale & largescale)
- build pgsql & mysql drivers as subpackages, as $DEITY intended
- @@pkgpath & PFRAG.[flavor]-main tweaks from sthen@@ (thanks!)
- remove init_pwent_cache() patch until i can make some sense of it
- remove painful strlcpy patches
- add patches to fix pgsql support with PSQL > 9.1 from
  http://sourceforge.net/p/dspam/bug-tracker/112/ &
http://sourceforge.net/p/dspam/bug-tracker/141
- add an rc script running dspam --daemon as _dspam
- patch default dspam.conf to trust user _dspam (pointed out by jca@@;
  thanks!) and to use port 2424 by default. Taken from debian.

Discussed at length with todd@@ (MAINTAINER), been running on amd64 with
pgsql &| sqlite backend since a while, also tested on sqlite/ppc.

Some tweaks might still be needed (a README ? Fix some weird crashers ?),
but at least it's better than what we had for the past years.

@DSPAM is an open-source, freely available anti-spam solution designed to 
combat unsolicited commercial email using advanced statistical analysis. 
In short, DSPAM filters spam by learning what spam is and isn't by 
learning each user's individual mail behavior. This allows DSPAM to 
provide highly-accurate, personalized filtering for each user on even a 
large system and provides an administratively maintenance free solution 
capable of learning each user's email behaviors with very few false 
positives.

Available flavors are:

- clamav: enable usage of the clam antivirus.

- ldap: include support for LDAP verification.

- sqlite: use the sqlite 2.x library as a storage engine.

- sqlite3: use the sqlite 3.x library as a storage engine. This is the
default.

- pgsql: use a postgresql server as a storage engine.

- mysql: use a mysql server as a storage engine.

- hash: use the CRM Sparse Spectra (CSS) storage engine.

- preferences : store user preferences in the database instead of flat files.
Has any effect only on mysql and pgsql flavors.

- daemon: add the ability to run dspam as multiple clients connecting to a
central server. This flavor is required in order to use the --daemon and
--client command-line switches. However, the daemon mode is currently
incompatible with sqlite.
