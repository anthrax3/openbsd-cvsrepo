@Update to dspam 3.10.2.

- remove 6 out of the 10 flavors maze, only keep the ones that make
  sense (ie clamav, ldap, domainscale & largescale)
- build pgsql & mysql drivers as subpackages, as $DEITY intended
- @@pkgpath & PFRAG.[flavor]-main tweaks from sthen@@ (thanks!)
- remove init_pwent_cache() patch until i can make some sense of it
- remove painful strlcpy patches
- add patches to fix pgsql support with PSQL > 9.1 from
  http://sourceforge.net/p/dspam/bug-tracker/112/ &
http://sourceforge.net/p/dspam/bug-tracker/141
- add an rc script running dspam --daemon as _dspam
- patch default dspam.conf to trust user _dspam (pointed out by jca@@;
  thanks!) and to use port 2424 by default. Taken from debian.

Discussed at length with todd@@ (MAINTAINER), been running on amd64 with
pgsql &| sqlite backend since a while, also tested on sqlite/ppc.

Some tweaks might still be needed (a README ? Fix some weird crashers ?),
but at least it's better than what we had for the past years.
