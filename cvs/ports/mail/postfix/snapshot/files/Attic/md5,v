@update to postfix snapshot 20010610. info from Wietse;

- A workaround for a bug in old versions of the CISCO PIX firewall software
l that caused mail to be resent repeatedly to systems behind such a product.
The same workaround will be folded into the "stable" release when time
permits.

- A much enhanced pipe delivery agent with flags to control case folding of
the $nexthop, $recipient, $user, $extension or $mailbox command-line macros.

- A much enhanced pipe delivery agent with proper quoting of white space and
other special characters in the expansions of the $sender and $recipient
command-line macros. This is necessary for correct operation of the "simple"
content filter, among others.

- Retraction of one RFC2821-induced change that was causing more problems
than it solved.

@update to postfix snapshot-20010130.


Incompatible changes with snapshot-20010128
===========================================

REJECT in header/body_checks is now flagged as policy violation
rather than bounce, for consistency in postmaster notifications.

The mailbox size limit for local delivery is no longer controlled
by the message_size_limit paramater, but by a separate parameter
called mailbox_size_limit (default: 20MBytes).

The default RBL (real-time blackhole lists) domain examples have
been updated from *.vix.com to *.mail-abuse.org.

Major changes with snapshot-20010128
====================================

Updated nqmgr (experimental queue manager with clever queueing
strategy) by Patrik Rak. This code is still new. Once it stops
changing (for a long time!) it will become part of the non-beta
release.

Virtual mailbox delivery agent by Andrew McNamara. This delivery
agent can deliver mail for any number of domains.  See the file
VIRTUAL_README for detailed examples. This code is still new. Once
it stops changing it will become part of the non-beta release.

Many "valid_hostname" warnings were eliminated. The complaints that
were not eliminated were replaced by something more informative.

SASL support (RFC 2554) for the LMTP delivery agent. This is required
by recent Cyrus implementations when delivering mail over TCP
sockets. The LMTP_README file has been updated but still contains
some obsolete information.

Workarounds for non-standard RFC 2554 (AUTH command) implementations.
Specify "broken_sasl_auth_clients = yes" to enable SMTP server
support for old Microsoft client applications. The Postfix SMTP
client supports non-standard RFC 2554 servers by default.

Extract from RELEASE_NOTES:
===========================

    Major changes with snapshot-20001217
    ====================================

    This release involves little change in functionality and a lot of
    small changes to lots of files. The code is put out as a separate
    snapshot release so that I have a tested baseline for further work.

    All time-related configuration parameters now accept a one-letter
    suffix to indicate the time unit (s: second, m: minute, h: hour,
    d: day, w: week). The exceptions are the LDAP and MYSQL modules
    which are maintained separately.

    The mysql client was partially rewritten in order to elimimate some
    memory allocation/deallocation problems. The code needs more work,
    and needs to be tested in a real production environment.

    The local_transport and default_transport configuration parameters
    can now be specified in transport:destination notation, just like
    the mailbox_transport and fallback_transport parameters.  The
    :destination part is optional.  However, these parameters take only
    one destination, unlike relayhost and fallback-relay which take
    any number of destinations.

@update to snapshot-20001210.

Extract from the RELEASE_NOTES file:

    Incompatible changes with snapshot-20001210
    ===========================================

    If this release does not work for you, you can go back to a previous
    Postfix version without losing your mail, subject to the "incompatible
    changes" listed for previous Postfix releases below.

    When delivering to /file/name (as directed in an alias or .forward
    file), the local delivery agent now logs a warning when it is unable
    to create a /file/name.lock file. Mail is still delivered as before.

    The "sun_mailtool_compatibility" feature is going away (a compatibility
    mode that turns off kernel locks on mailbox files). It still works,
    but a warning is logged. Instead of using "sun_mailtool_compatibility",
    specify the mailbox locking strategy as "mailbox_delivery_lock =
    dotlock".

    The Postfix SMTP client now skips SMTP server replies that do not
    start with "CODE SPACE" or with "CODE HYPHEN" and flags them as
    protocol errors. Older Postfix SMTP clients silently treated "CODE
    TEXT" as "CODE SPACE TEXT", i.e. as a valid SMTP reply.

    This snapshot does not yet change default relay settings. That
    change alone affects a dozen files, most of which documentation.
    This may be an incompatibility with some people's expectations,
    but such are my rules - between code freeze and release no major
    functionality changes are allowed.

    Several interfaces of libutil and libglobal routines have changed.
    This may break third-party code written for Postfix. In particular,
    the safe_open() routine has changed, the way the preferred locking
    method is specified in the sys_defs.h file, as well as all routines
    that perform file locking. When compiling third-party code written
    for Postfix, the incompatibilities will be detected by the compiler
    provided that #include file dependencies are properly maintained.

    Major changes with snapshot-20001210
    ====================================

    This snapshot includes bugfixes that were already released as
    patches 12 and 13 for the 19991231 "stable" release:

      - The queue manager could deadlock for 10 seconds when bouncing
        mail under extreme load from one-to-one mass mailings.

      - Local delivery performance was substandard, because the per-user
        concurrency limit accidentally applied to the entire local
        domain.

    The mailbox locking style is now fully configurable at runtime.
    The new configuration parameter is called "mailbox_delivery_lock".
    Depending on the operating system type, mailboxes can be locked
    with one or more of "flock", "fcntl" or "dotlock".  The command
    "postconf -l" shows the available locking styles.  The default
    mailbox locking style is system dependent.  This change affects
    all mailbox and all "/file/name" deliveries by the Postfix local
    delivery agent.

    The new "import_environment" and "export_environment" configuration
    parameters now provide explicit control over what environment
    variables Postfix will import, and what environment variables
    Postfix will pass on to a non-Postfix process. This is better than
    hard-coding my debugging environment into public releases.

    The "mailbox_transport" and "fallback_transport" parameters now
    understand the form "transport:nexthop", with suitable defaults
    when either transport or nexthop are omitted, just like in the
    Postfix transport map. This allows you to specify for example,
    "mailbox_transport = lmtp:unix:/file/name".

    The MYSQL client now supports server connections over UNIX-domain
    sockets.  Code provided by Piotr Klaban. See the file MYSQL_README
    for examples of "host" syntax.

Quote from the RELEASE_NOTES file:

    Incompatible changes with snapshot-20001121
    ===========================================

    If this release does not work for you, you can go back to a previous
    Postfix version without losing your mail, subject to the "incompatible
    changes" listed for previous Postfix releases below.

    Major changes with snapshot-20001121
    ====================================

    Support for RedHat Linux 7.0.  On RedHat Linux 7.0, you must install
    the db3-devel RPM before you can compile the Postfix source code.

    The mailbox_transport feature works again. It was broken when the
    "require_home_directory" feature was added.

    More general virtual domain support.  Postfix now supports both
    Sendmail-style virtual domains and Postfix-style virtual domains.
    Details and examples are given in the revised virtual manual page.

    - With Sendmail-style virtual domains, local users/aliases/mailing
      lists are visible as localname@@virtual.domain. This is convenient
      if you want to host mailing lists under virtual domains.

    - With Postfix-style virtual domains, local users/aliases/mailing
      lists are not visible as localname@@virtual.domain. Each virtual
      domain has its own separate name space.

    More general "soft bounce" feature.  Specify "soft_bounce = yes"
    in main.cf to prevent the SMTP server from bouncing mail while you
    are testing configurations. Until this release the SMTP server was
    not aware of soft bounces.
