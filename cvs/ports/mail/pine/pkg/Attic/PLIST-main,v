@This is an attempt by UW to enter us into a CONTRACT.  Those terms
in that license are CONTRACT terms, and I absolutely will not accept
such bullshit anywhere near our tree.  Delete with prejudice.  This
should NEVER have entered our tree.  pine is not free software in ANY
SENSE.  People should stop using the non-free trash.
