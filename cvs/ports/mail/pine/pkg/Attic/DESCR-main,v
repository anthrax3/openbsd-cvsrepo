@- remove pine; it has been replaced by alpine

@Pine is a tool for reading, sending, and managing electronic messages.  
It was designed specifically with novice computer users in mind, but can
be tailored to accommodate the needs of "power users" as well.  Pine uses
Internet message protocols (e.g. RFC-822, SMTP, MIME, IMAP, NNTP) and runs
on Unix and PCs.  This package also includes the IMAP daemon, a POP2
server, and a POP3 server, but not the pico editor.

If you want to use the spell checking feature of pine, install ispell and
set the environment variable SPELL to "${PREFIX}/ispell -l".

An optional configuration file "pine.conf" can be put into /etc to set
system wide defaults.  The format of this file is identical to the .pinerc
file that is auto-generated by pine in your home directory.
