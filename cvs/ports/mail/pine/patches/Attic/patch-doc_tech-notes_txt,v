    There are, however, three optional auxiliary files:
-   /usr/local/lib/pine.info, /usr/local/lib/pine.conf, and
-   /usr/local/lib/pine.conf.fixed. The file pine.info contains text on
-   how to get further help on the local system. It is part of the help

-   desk or the system administrator. If this file doesn't exist a generic

-   site'' is shown. The file pine.conf is used to set system-wide default
-   configurations for _Pine_. The file pine.conf.fixed is also used to
-   set system-wide default configurations for _Pine_. The difference
