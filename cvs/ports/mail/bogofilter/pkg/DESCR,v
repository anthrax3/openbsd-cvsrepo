@		bogofilter -- fast Bayesian spam filtering

This package implements a fast Bayesian spam filter along the lines suggested 
by Paul Graham in his article "A Plan For Spam".

This version substantially improves on Paul's proposal by doing smarter
lexical analysis.  In particular, hostnames and IP addresses are retained
as recognition features rather than broken up. Various kinds of MTA 
cruft such as dates and message-IDs are discarded so as not to bloat
the word lists.

Flavors:
	* db4:		use v4 of the Berkeley database
	* sqlite3:	use SQLite 3 database backend
	* qdbm:		use QDBM database backend

- Fix some linking issues.
- Introduce two new FLAVORS. (qdbm and sqlite3 database backends)

@bayesian spam filter, works just fine, even though one regression test
is failing (too much precision in arithmetic).
