@Update to geary 0.4.1.

Move from libgee06 to libgee, and from gnome-keyring to libsecret. Still
seems to work fine with gmail. Note, if you use two-factor auth, refer
to
http://redmine.yorba.org/projects/geary/wiki/Geary_FAQ#How-can-I-use-Geary-with-Googles-2-Step-authentication
See for new features:
