@OfflineIMAP is a software to dispose your e-mail mailbox(es) as a local
Maildir. OfflineIMAP will synchronize both sides via IMAP.

The main downside about IMAP is that you have to trust your email provider to
not lose your mails. This is not something impossible while not very common.
With OfflineIMAP, you can download your Mailboxes and make your own backups of
the Maildir.

This allows reading your email while offline without the need for the mail
reader (MUA) to support IMAP disconnected operations. Need an attachment from a
message without internet connection? It's fine, the message is still there.

OfflineIMAP is  a  tool  to   simplify   your   e-mail  reading.   With
OfflineIMAP,  you  can  read  the same mailbox from multiple computers.
You get a current copy of your messages on each computer,  and  changes
you make one place will be visible on all other systems.  For instance,
you can delete a message on your home  computer,  and  it  will  appear
deleted  on  your work computer as well.  OfflineIMAP is also useful if
you want to use a mail reader that does not have IMAP support, has poor
IMAP support, or does not provide disconnected operation.

OfflineIMAP is FAST; it synchronizes my two accounts with over 50 fold-
ers in 3 seconds.  Other similar tools might take over  a  minute,  and
achieve  a  less-reliable  result.   Some mail readers can take over 10
minutes to do the same thing, and some don't even support  it  at  all.
Unlike other mail tools, OfflineIMAP features a multi-threaded synchro-
nization algorithm that can dramatically speed up performance  in  many
situations by synchronizing several different things simultaneously.

OfflineIMAP is FLEXIBLE; you can customize which folders are synced via
regular expressions, lists, or Python expressions; a versatile and com-
prehensive  configuration  file  is  used to control behavior; two user
interfaces are built-in; fine-tuning of synchronization performance  is
possible; internal or external automation is supported; SSL and PREAUTH
tunnels are both supported; offline (or "unplugged")  reading  is  sup-
ported;  and esoteric IMAP features are supported to ensure compatibil-
ity with the widest variety of IMAP servers.
