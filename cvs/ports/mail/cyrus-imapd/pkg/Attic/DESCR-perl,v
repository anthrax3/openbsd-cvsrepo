@Update to cyrus-imapd-2.4.17.
Merge both subpackages into one -- it made sense when the port was not
SHARED_ONLY but it's been for a while now.
Use /nonexistent for the _cyrus user homedir.

@This package contains the perl utilities for managing the Cyrus IMAP

Thanks to cyrus developer  Bron Gondwana for the huge help in debugging

The Cyrus IMAP server differs from other IMAP server implementations in
that it is generally intended to be run on sealed servers, where normal
users are not permitted to log in. The mailbox database is stored in
parts of the filesystem that are private to the Cyrus IMAP system. All
user access to mail is through the IMAP, POP3, or KPOP protocols.

The private mailbox database design gives the server large advantages in
efficiency, scalability, and administratability. Multiple concurrent
read/write connections to the same mailbox are permitted. The server
supports access control lists on mailboxes and storage quotas on mailbox
hierarchies.
