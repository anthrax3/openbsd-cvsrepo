log
@Update to cyrus-imapd-2.4.17.
Merge both subpackages into one -- it made sense when the port was not
SHARED_ONLY but it's been for a while now.
Use /nonexistent for the _cyrus user homedir.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------
| Running ${FULLPKGNAME} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

WARNING: mmap(2) is not fully POSIX on OpenBSD so cyrus needs to
map_refresh on every lock which will incure a performance penalty under
high load. See this bugreport for details:
    http://bugzilla.cyrusimap.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3370

The following man pages have been renamed to avoid conflicts with other
packages:
    deliver(8)   -> cyrus-deliver(8)   # conflict with mail/archiveopteryx
    fetchnews(8) -> cyrus-fetchnews(8) # conflict with news/leafnode
    idled(8)     -> cyrus-idled(8)     # conflict with sysutils/idled
    master(8)    -> cyrus-master(8)    # conflict with mail/postfix
    imapd(8)     -> cyrus-imapd(8)     # conflict with mail/courier-imap

cyrus-imapd uses the LOG_LOCAL6 syslog facility for logging. This
package of cyrus-imapd uses idled for IMAP IDLE.

Don't forget to edit /etc/services to include missing network services
if needed.
    e.g. sieve		2000/tcp

@Unbreak.
Thanks to cyrus developer  Bron Gondwana for the huge help in debugging
the issue and for actually fixing it.

While here, move to pkg-readmes.
