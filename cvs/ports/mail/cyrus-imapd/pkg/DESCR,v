@Major update to cyrus-imapd-3.0.1.
- cleanup and fix some ports specific stuff while here

Refer to upstream for changes and upgrade notes.
Note that altnamespace and unixhierarchysep are now on by default on, to match
the behaviour of most other IMAP servers in the world.
@
text
@The Cyrus IMAP server differs from other IMAP server implementations in that it
is generally intended to be run on sealed servers, where normal users are not
permitted to log in. The mailbox database is stored in parts of the filesystem
that are private to the Cyrus IMAP system. All user access to mail is through
the IMAP, POP3, or KPOP protocols.

The private mailbox database design gives the server large advantages in
efficiency, scalability, and administratability. Multiple concurrent read/write
connections to the same mailbox are permitted. The server supports access
control lists on mailboxes and storage quotas on mailbox hierarchies.

WARNING: mmap(2) is not fully POSIX on OpenBSD so cyrus needs to map_refresh on
every lock which will incure a performance penalty under high load. See this
bugreport for details:
    http://bugzilla.cyrusimap.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3370

@Update to cyrus-imapd-2.4.17.
Merge both subpackages into one -- it made sense when the port was not
SHARED_ONLY but it's been for a while now.
Use /nonexistent for the _cyrus user homedir.

Because of cyrus-imapd+OpenBSD mmap uncompatibility, the server runs in
compat mode incuring a performance penalty under high load.

Following man pages have been renamed to avoid conflicts with other
packages:
    fetchnews(8) -> cyrus-fetchnews(8) # conflict with news/leafnode
    idled(8)     -> cyrus-idled(8)     # conflict with sysutils/idled
    master(8)    -> cyrus-master(8)    # conflict with mail/postfix
    imapd(8)     -> cyrus-imapd(8)     # conflict with mail/courier-imap

Cyrus-imapd uses the LOG_LOCAL6 syslog facility for logging. This port
of cyrus-imapd uses idled for IMAP IDLE.

Available flavors:
    drac     - Build drac support (for roaming users relay)
    kerberos - Build support for KerberosV authentication
