log
@Remove SECURITY files. They have served their purpose in the past but
have become pretty useless nowadays (and the pkg tools do not display
them anyway).
Some which contained valuable information have been turned into READMEs.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------
| Running ${FULLPKGNAME} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Maildrop must be run as the uid/gid of the user whose mailbox it is
delivering to.

Therefore, if the MTA does not spawn it with the correct uid/gid, it
needs to be suid root to perform the operation itself.

The port is installed with the suid bit stripped by default. This works
out-of-the-box with MTAs like qmail, which spawn maildrop with the
correct uid/gid it needs to perform the delivery.

For more information, please read the documentation in
${PREFIX}/share/doc/maildrop/INSTALL.
It should be safe to enable the suid bits, but scan over the code first
and satisfy yourself that there are no security holes.

If you perform a full audit, please inform <ports@@openbsd.org> and the
suid bit may then be enabled by default.

The following files will need suid re-enabled if you so choose:
	${PREFIX}/bin/maildrop
	${PREFIX}/bin/lockmail
