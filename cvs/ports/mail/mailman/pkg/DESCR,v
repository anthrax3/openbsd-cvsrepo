log
@- Update to 2.1.21.
- gc configure patch since it hasn't been required since introducing
  --without-permcheck in configure, despite the comment in Makefile.
- Some of Defaults.py are now upstream defaults.

Remove FLAVORs:
- Rewrite src/common.c:check_caller() for the cgi/mail wrapper to now
  look at the defined group membership instead, _mailmanq (a new group).
  This allows the administrator to switch mail servers and web servers
  without requiring a FLAVOR for each combination; but rather, by simply
  adding the cgi/mail user to the _mailmanq group. This is a diversion
  from upstream, but will be proposed. At least sthen@@ and dlg@@ agree to
  go in this general direction.

Mailman has most of the standard features you'd expect in a
mailing list manager, and more:

- Web based list administration for nearly all tasks.  Web based
  subscriptions and user configuration management.  A customizable
  "home page" for each mailing list.

- Privacy features such as moderation, open and closed list
  subscription policies, and private membership rosters.

- Automatic web based archiving built-in with support for private
  and public archives, and hooks for external archivers.

- Per-user configuration optional digest delivery for either
  MIME-compliant or RFC 934 style "plain text" digests.

- Integrated mail/Usenet gateways.

- Integrated auto-replies.

- Majordomo-style email based commands.

- Integrated bounce detection within an extensible framework.

- Integrated spam detection.

- An extensible mail delivery pipeline.

- Support for virtual domains.

    The default flavor makes the mailwrapper run in group _smtpd, for smtpd
    postfix - makes the mailwrapper run in group _mailman, for  postfix
    sendmail - makes the mailwrapper run in group daemon, for sendmail
