@Courier-IMAP is a server that provides IMAP access to Maildirs
mailboxes. This IMAP server does NOT handle traditional mailbox files
(/var/spool/mail, and derivatives), it was written for the specific
purpose of providing IMAP access to Maildirs.

The Courier-IMAP implements some extensions to the basic Maildir mail
storage format in order to support some additional features, such as
folders and "soft" quotas. This is done in a way that's backwards
compatible with the standard Maildir users (although, of course, they
will ignore the additional features). Other software that understands
and uses the same Maildir extensions is SqWebMail, and maildrop.

"Maildir" is a directory-based mail storage format originally introduced
in the Qmail mail server, and adopted as an alternative mail storage
format by both Exim and Postfix. Courier-IMAP is popular on
Qmail/Exim/Postfix sites that are configured to use maildirs.  The
primary advantage of maildirs is that multiple applications can access
the same maildir simultaneously without requiring any kind of locking
whatsoever. It is a faster and more efficient way to store mail. It
works particularly well over NFS, which has a long history of
locking-related woes.

It is part of the Courier mail server (http://www.courier-mta.org) but
can be configured as a standalone IMAP server.

Features include an extremely small memory footprint, abstract
authentication modules (e.g. /etc/passwd, LDAP, PAM), virtual mailbox
support, resource controls, SSL/TLS, and IPv6 support.

@Update to courier-imap 4.1.1.  If you used courier-imap before, you should
now also use courier-authlib (which is new) as the authentication stuff
has been moved there.

This should make our courier system again faily complete, we have been
running this code for almost a year.

@Upgrade to courier-imap-1.5.1

Eliminate the ldap and mysql flavors - now this package generates
subpackages for the pop3 server, and also mysql, ldap and pgsql
authentication modules.  Should make installing it from binary
packages significantly easier, and allow us to build less package
combinations.

@Upgrade to courier-imap-1.3.8.1

- Split into subpackages: courier-pop3 and courier-imap
- pop3 FLAVOR no longer needed, so removed
- Disable ipv6, since if it detects ipv6, it will bind only to the ipv6
  socket and expect that to also accept ipv4 connections.  Author notified

1.6
log
@Update to use the authdaemon framework, instead of directly accessing
the static authentication modules.

This allows us to add two new flavors: ldap and mysql, which communicate
via the authdaemon.

Note that this requires users to rehaul their configuration scripts;
the INSTALL script should detect this and print out a message.

The 'pop3' flavor also adds a POP3/POP3-SSL module to the package
which can be used alongside the IMAP portion.

@Upgrade to Courier-IMAP 1.2.3

This introduces a new 'pop3' flavour, since the package bundles a POP3
server that can read from maildirs and use the same authmodules also.

And a number of stability fixes, including leaking file descriptions,
maildir handling, and also compliance with the latest IETF IMAP drafts.
