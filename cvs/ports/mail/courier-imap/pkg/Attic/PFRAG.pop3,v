@Upgrade to courier-imap-1.3.8.1

- Split into subpackages: courier-pop3 and courier-imap
- pop3 FLAVOR no longer needed, so removed
- Disable ipv6, since if it detects ipv6, it will bind only to the ipv6
  socket and expect that to also accept ipv4 connections.  Author notified

@- upgrade to courier-imap-1.3.0

- regenerate patches and name them consistently.  Note that the
  configuration file format and names have changed with this release

- add an INSTALL shell fragment to detect old versions of the config
files and warn the user to regenerate them

- config files now live in /etc/courier-imap, as they are very
  generic names, and this avoid conflict with other imap daemons

Summary of changes:

This release fixes some bugs in the POP3 server, adds optional
support for gb2312 and big5 text search, and introduces a new
configuration file format.

The new configuration file format will allow future upgrades
to automatically preserve the existing system configuration data,
instead of installing a default set of configuration files

log
@Upgrade to Courier-IMAP 1.2.3

This introduces a new 'pop3' flavour, since the package bundles a POP3
server that can read from maildirs and use the same authmodules also.

And a number of stability fixes, including leaking file descriptions,
maildir handling, and also compliance with the latest IETF IMAP drafts.
