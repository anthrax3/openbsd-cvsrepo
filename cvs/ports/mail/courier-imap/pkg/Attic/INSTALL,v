@- We had courier-imap 1.3.5 in the ports tree three years ago.
  There is no need to tutor users how to upgrade from this version.
- Bump FULLPKGNAME (only courier-imap, not SUBPACKAGEs)

1.3
log
@Update to use the authdaemon framework, instead of directly accessing
the static authentication modules.

This allows us to add two new flavors: ldap and mysql, which communicate
via the authdaemon.

Note that this requires users to rehaul their configuration scripts;
the INSTALL script should detect this and print out a message.

1.1
log
@- upgrade to courier-imap-1.3.0

- regenerate patches and name them consistently.  Note that the
  configuration file format and names have changed with this release

- add an INSTALL shell fragment to detect old versions of the config
files and warn the user to regenerate them

- config files now live in /etc/courier-imap, as they are very
  generic names, and this avoid conflict with other imap daemons

Summary of changes:

This release fixes some bugs in the POP3 server, adds optional
support for gb2312 and big5 text search, and introduces a new
configuration file format.

The new configuration file format will allow future upgrades
to automatically preserve the existing system configuration data,
instead of installing a default set of configuration files
