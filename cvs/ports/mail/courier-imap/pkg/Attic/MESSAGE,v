@Example config files for Courier-IMAP have been installed in
${PREFIX}/share/examples/courier-imap and copied also to
${SYSCONFDIR}/courier-imap, edit them to your site's needs.

Pay particular attention to the details in imapd.cnf, and read ssl(8) if
necessary. You MUST set the CN in imapd.cnf to the hostname by which
your IMAP server is accessed, or else clients will complain. When this
is done, you can use the 'mkimapdcert' script to automatically generate
a server certificate, which is installed into /etc/ssl/private/imapd.pem

To control the daemon use ${PREFIX}/libexec/imapd.rc and

mkdir -p ${COURIERSTATE}

@Update to courier-imap 4.1.1.  If you used courier-imap before, you should
now also use courier-authlib (which is new) as the authentication stuff
has been moved there.

This should make our courier system again faily complete, we have been
running this code for almost a year.

@Upgrade to courier-imap-1.3.8.1

- Split into subpackages: courier-pop3 and courier-imap
- pop3 FLAVOR no longer needed, so removed
- Disable ipv6, since if it detects ipv6, it will bind only to the ipv6
  socket and expect that to also accept ipv4 connections.  Author notified

@Update to use the authdaemon framework, instead of directly accessing
the static authentication modules.

This allows us to add two new flavors: ldap and mysql, which communicate
via the authdaemon.

Note that this requires users to rehaul their configuration scripts;
the INSTALL script should detect this and print out a message.

If you also installed the 'pop3' flavor, then the relevant
configuration files are called pop3d-* instead of imapd-*
Follow similar instructions to those above to activate this.

@- upgrade to courier-imap-1.3.0

- regenerate patches and name them consistently.  Note that the
  configuration file format and names have changed with this release

- add an INSTALL shell fragment to detect old versions of the config
files and warn the user to regenerate them

- config files now live in /etc/courier-imap, as they are very
  generic names, and this avoid conflict with other imap daemons

Summary of changes:

This release fixes some bugs in the POP3 server, adds optional
support for gb2312 and big5 text search, and introduces a new
configuration file format.

The new configuration file format will allow future upgrades
to automatically preserve the existing system configuration data,
instead of installing a default set of configuration files

@Upgrade to Courier-IMAP 1.2.3

This introduces a new 'pop3' flavour, since the package bundles a POP3
server that can read from maildirs and use the same authmodules also.

And a number of stability fixes, including leaking file descriptions,
maildir handling, and also compliance with the latest IETF IMAP drafts.

It is generally not a good idea to expose plain-text IMAP to
the outside world, so you can bind the plain-text one to 
127.0.0.1, and the SSL one to your external IP interface(s).
