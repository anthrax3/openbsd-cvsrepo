@Update to courier-imap 4.1.1.  If you used courier-imap before, you should
now also use courier-authlib (which is new) as the authentication stuff
has been moved there.

This should make our courier system again faily complete, we have been
running this code for almost a year.

@Upgrade to courier-imap-1.5.1

Eliminate the ldap and mysql flavors - now this package generates
subpackages for the pop3 server, and also mysql, ldap and pgsql
authentication modules.  Should make installing it from binary
packages significantly easier, and allow us to build less package
combinations.
