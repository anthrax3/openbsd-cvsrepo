@What is XFaces?

       XFaces is a program that will display an image for each
    piece of mail in your mail box.  This lets you know at a
    glance who you have mail from.  XFaces starts out (when you
    have no mail) looking like a color xbiff.  As you receive
    mail XFaces becomes a column of mail images.  Some of XFaces
    features:

      - Both mono and color images.

      - Optional Shaped window support with both xpm and xbm.

      - Sound support using the NetAudio protocol. The NetAudio server 
        currently supports Sun's SparcStation (SunOS 4.1.X and Solaris 2.2),
        SGI's Indigo and NCD MCX X terminals running NCDware 3.1 or later.

      - Face images can be "compressed" so that each image will only
        show up once on your display.  This way, if you receive 30 messages
        from one user, list or whatever the image will only show up once.

      - You can use regular expressions to search any headers to choose
        images and sounds or ignore that mail message completely. This
        lets you specify an image/sound for mail that comes from a
        mailing list or ignore mail that you have already seen but
        left in your system mailbox.

      - Compatibility support for Rich Burridge's faces program. This 
        includes the ability to run user command to generate the image
        list.

      - Support for POP mailboxes.

      - XFaces can kick off shell commands based upon mailbox
        contents.  You could have yourself paged when a high priority
        item needs your attention.

      - XFaces can run external filters to convert images into Xpm
        so that image formats that XFaces does not understand can
        be used.

      - The annotations for mail items include username, hostname,
        count, user@@host, the contents of any header.

@Add xfaces 3.3 port.
Unfortunately, libaudio (from audio/nas) is not trivial to port, so i
removed the sound support for now.
