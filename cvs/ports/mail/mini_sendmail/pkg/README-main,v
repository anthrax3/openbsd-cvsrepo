+-----------------------------------------------------------------------
| Running ${FULLPKGNAME} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

First things first, we need to install the chroot subpackage of
mini_sendmail if you have not done so already.  This will put a
statically linked mini_sendmail binary into a location reachable by
Apache when it is under chroot(2), /var/www/bin/mini_sendmail to be
precise.

Next, we need to tell PHP about our fake sendmail binary.  The php.ini
examples leave the sendmail_path directive commented out.  We need to
change it to point to mini_sendmail:

;sendmail_path =
sendmail_path = "/bin/mini_sendmail -t -i"

PHP executes mini_sendmail by using the popen(3) function.
Unfortunately, this means we are required to copy /bin/sh into the
Apache chroot area:

# cp -p /bin/sh /var/www/bin/sh

If everything has been performed correctly, after a stop and restart of
Apache (if it is running), we should now be able to utilize the PHP
mail() function.
