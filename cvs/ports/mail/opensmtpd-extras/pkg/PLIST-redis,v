1.1
log
@overdue update of opensmtpd-extras to most recent snapshot
build system changed to autoconf/automake

remove PREFIX=/usr workaround after smtpd was adjusted to look into
/usr/local/libexec as well, thanks gilles

this also brings table-sqlite, table-passwd, and table-ldap up-to-date,
which will be removed from base soon

with help and input from giovanni, landry, sthen, and aja

ok giovanni (maintainer)
