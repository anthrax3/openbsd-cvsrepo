@update to latest snapshot 201607122008 to unbreak after api and header changes
this snapshot also removes most filters, as they are not considered ready

people who started using filters like dkim-signer already, need to look for
other alternatives in ports tree e.g. dkimproxy

log
@overdue update of opensmtpd-extras to most recent snapshot
build system changed to autoconf/automake

remove PREFIX=/usr workaround after smtpd was adjusted to look into
/usr/local/libexec as well, thanks gilles

this also brings table-sqlite, table-passwd, and table-ldap up-to-date,
which will be removed from base soon

with help and input from giovanni, landry, sthen, and aja

ok giovanni (maintainer)
