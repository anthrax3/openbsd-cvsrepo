@Remove p5-GetLive, it's been declared EOL upstream after playing catchup
with Hotmail/Live changes for years:

@GetLive is the answer to accessing your hotmail, now outlook, without
using the web or without being limited to the inbox using pop3.

GetLive is a perl script that interfaces with your hotmail, now outlook,
account to retrieve your emails. It has 2 operating modes that I call
"Classic" and "FreePops".

In "Classic" mode it fetches mail from your hotmail, now outlook,
account. The mail is then presented to any filter (typically procmail)
for further processing or dropping in a local mailbox. The downloading
can be limited to unread mail or to message-ids that were not yet
downloaded before. For the latter GetLive keeps track of all downloaded
message-ids. Messages can be marked read or moved to a folder after
being downloaded.

In "FreePops" mode, GetLive starts up as a POP3 server listening on a
port. Your email client would connect to it as it does to any POP3
server. Requests are however translated such that you effectively get
your mails from your hotmail/outlook account. Special constructs are
possible to interact with more than Inbox. Also in this case messages
can be marked read on the account after being read.

@GetLive is a perl script that fetches mail from your Hotmail
Live account. The mail is then presented to any filter (typically 
procmail) for further processing or dropping in a local mailbox.

This port replaces mail/gotmail (which doesn't work with Hotmail Live)
