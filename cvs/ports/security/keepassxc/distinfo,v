@management tool for sensitive data

KeePassXC is a community fork of KeePassX, the cross-platform port of KeePass
for Windows. Every feature works cross-platform and was thoroughly tested on
multiple systems to provide users with the same look and feel on every
supported operating system. This includes the beloved Auto-Type feature.

The complete database is always encrypted with the industry-standard AES (alias
Rijndael) encryption algorithm using a 256 bit key. KeePassXC uses a database
format that is compatible with KeePass Password Safe. Your wallet works offline
and requires no Internet connection.
