Off-the-Record (OTR) Messaging allows you to have private 
conversations over instant messaging by providing:

* Encryption
        No one else can read your instant messages.
* Authentication
        You are assured the correspondent is who you think it is. 
* Deniability
        The messages you send do not have digital signatures that
        are checkable by a third party. Anyone can forge messages
        after a conversation to make them look like they came from
        you. However, during a conversation, your correspondent is
        assured the messages he sees are authentic and unmodified. 
* Perfect forward secrecy
        If you lose control of your private keys, no previous 
        conversation is compromised.
