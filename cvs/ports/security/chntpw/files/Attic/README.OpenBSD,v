@USE AT OWN RISK. READ ALL DOCUMENTS CAREFULLY. One thing worse than
being unable to login is being unable to boot; you can get there from here.

To use this program, you must have built a kernel with the config option

option NTFS

(Most kernels built after 2010/09/08 have this enabled by default).

And, you must have mounted the root of your Windoze filesystem as something like

mount -t ntfs -o rw /dev/wd1i /mnt

If your NT disk is small enough to dd to a file on your real disk, you can
experiment along these lines (see mount_vnd to understand):

# mount -t vnd -o c xp-test.hd /dev/vnd0c
# mount -t ntfs /dev/vnd0i /mnt

Then

cd /mnt/Windows/System32/config

chntpw -u noobish sam system security ... or other commands,
or
chntpw SAM SYSTEM SECURITY # sometimes names are upper case.
as per the README.txt file in this directory.
See also the other text files.

READ ALL WARNINGS. As it says there and on the web site: USE AT OWN RISK.
