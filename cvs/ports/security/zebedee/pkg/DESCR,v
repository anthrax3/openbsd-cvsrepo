@Zebedee is a simple program to establish an encrypted, compressed TCP or
UDP tunnel between two systems. This allows traffic such as telnet, ftp,
VNC, and X to be protected from snooping as well as potentially gaining
performance over low-bandwidth networks from compression.

Flavors:
	udp_spoof - Limited unidirectional UDP source address spoofing,
		    intended for applications like syslog.
