@To start CFS automatically at boot time, add these lines to /etc/rc.local:

if [ -x ${PREFIX}/sbin/cfsd ]; then

		mount -o port=3049,nfsv2,intr,sync localhost:/null /crypt

Then do these steps as root:

   0) add this line to /etc/exports

/null localhost

   1) set "nfs_server=YES" and "portmap=YES" in /etc/rc.conf.local
   2) reboot or start all necessary daemons by hand and mount /crypt

@clean up MESSAGE/UNMESSAGE and mention startup code here, it's going
to be removed from rc.local

synchronously mount /crypt as suggested in pr 3567, this way I can move
even files bigger than a few KB into the crypted directory.

CFS is started automatically in /etc/rc.local. In order for it to work
properly, you have to do these steps as root:

      /null localhost
   1) set "nfs_server=YES" in /etc/rc.conf
   2) reboot or start mountd and cfsd by hand and mount /crypt

log
@update to cfs 1.4.1

CFS was actually broken since at least 3.2 or so, but should work now
again on 32-bit archs. 64-bit archs are still broken and won't be
fixed anytime soon.

I also set PERMIT_*=Yes, as the "no fee" part of the license is clearly
due to bad english.
