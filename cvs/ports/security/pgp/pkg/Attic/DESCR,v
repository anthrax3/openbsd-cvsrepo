@Remove security/pgp.

Our pgp port is for version 2.6.3 from 1996. Nothing depends on it
anymore since we deleted mail/pgpsendmail.

We have security/pgp5 in the tree (version 5.0i).

@	    Pretty Good Privacy version 2.6.3ia (world wide use)

PGP 2.6.3ia is not an official PGP version. It is based on the source
code for MIT PGP 2.6.2 and has been modified for world wide use. PGP
2.6.3i (international) is legal in the United States after September
6, 2000 (when RSA Security, Inc. placed its public key encryption
algorithm in the public domain).

For a more thorough installation and usage guide, refer to the file
setup.doc and the documentation for PGP 2.6.2, which is included
unmodified in the doc/ subdirectory that is created when you unpack the
distribution archive and installed in /usr/local/share/doc.

Remove intl and usa flavors.  There is now a single world wide
version (RSA Security Inc. placed its public key encryption algorithm
into the public domain, today).

PGP 2.6.3[i]a is not an official PGP version. It is based on the source
code for MIT PGP 2.6.2 and has been modified for international use. PGP
2.6.3i (international) is probably illegal to use within the USA, but is
fine in almost every other country in the world.  PGP 2.6.3a can be
compiled from the same source and is legal even inside the USA.

All changes in the source that are not applicable within the USA are
enclosed in #ifdef's, thus enabling you to compile a PGP version that is
legal to use within the USA. This is accomplished by adding the -DUSA
option when building the program, and by linking it with the RSAREF
library (rsaglue2) rather than MPILIB (rsaglue1).   When compiled this
way PGP will identify itself as 2.6.3a.
