@Add kth-krb port.  Stuff in src/ is old.  From art@@ and lha@@stacken.kth.se

A source distribution of Kerberos 4. It is based on eBones (which is
based on MIT Kerberos 4 patchlevel 9), but has been severely hacked

Apart from the core Kerberos programs the distribution contains the following: 

     telnet and telnetd, rsh, rcp, rlogin and rshd, rlogind, login, su
     ftp and ftpd following (mostly) the ftpsec Internet draft. 
     kauth (kinit + afs support + remote kinit (like rkinit) + batch support) 
     kpopper and an emacs 19.30 movemail with kpop support 
     kx for encrypted X sessions, xnlock,
     kip for encrypted IP tunnels (requires tunnel device) 
     afslog (aklog clone), pagsh, and kstring2key for the AFS minded 
     authentication modules for Irix, Digital UNIX, and PAM.
