@Since we have swap encryption on OpenBSD, only warn about insecure
memory if swap encryption is disabled. (It's enabled by default.)

This supersedes pkg/MESSAGE.

Regen patches with update-patches while I'm here. Bump PKGNAME.

@The manpage of GnuPG mentions the need for memory page locking.
In fact this is not needed as OpenBSD enables swap file encryption
by default.

However you might want to get rid of the misleading 'using insecure
memory' warning. Just put 'no-secmem-warning' into your ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf
file or use gpg with the --no-secmem-warning switch.

In fact this is not needed as OpenBSD supports swap file encryption.

You can

- enable memory page locking for non-root users if you set the setuid
  bit for the gpg binary (most likely 'chmod u+s ${PREFIX}/bin/gpg').

- enable swap encryption by setting vm.swapencrypt.enable=1 with
  sysctl(8). This is recommended.

In the latter case you may want to get rid of the misleading 'using
insecure memory' warning. Just put 'no-secmem-warning' to your
~/.gnupg/gpg.conf file or use gpg with the --no-secmem-warning switch.
