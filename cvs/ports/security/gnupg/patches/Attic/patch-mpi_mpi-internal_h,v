Bugfix from 1.4.15.

 commit 9dc6dd0572102a2fa27df28ba4d66728827eb03d
 Author: Werner Koch <wk@@gnupg.org>
 Date:   Mon Sep 16 15:57:01 2013 +0200

     Fix bug in mpi_tdiv_q_2exp.

     * mpi/mpi-internal.h (MPN_COPY_INCR): Make it work.
     --

     This bug has been with us since the version 0.0.0 of GnuPG.
     Fortunately it only affects an optimized code path which is rarely
     used in practice: If the shift size matches the size of a
     limb (i.e.. 32 or 64); this is is_prime in primegen.c.  Over there the
     Rabin-Miller test may fail with a probability of 2^-31 (that is if the
     to be tested prime - 1 has the low 32 bits cleared).  In practice the
     probability is even much less because we first do a Fermat test on the
     randomly generated candidates which sorts out the majority of
     composite numbers.

     The bug in MPN_COPY_INCR was found by Sven Bjorn.
