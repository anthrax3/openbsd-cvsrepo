log
@SECURITY and other bug fixes.

- A vulnerability in ClamAV's chm-parser allowed remote attackers to
cause a denial of service (application crash) via a malformed CHM file
(CVE-2008-1389).

- A vulnerability in libclamav would allow attackers to cause a
denial of service via vectors related to an out-of-memory condition
(CVE-2008-3912).

- Multiple memory leaks were found in ClamAV that could possibly allow
attackers to cause a denial of service via excessive memory consumption
(CVE-2008-3913).

- A number of unspecified vulnerabilities in ClamAV were reported that
have an unknown impact and attack vectors related to file descriptor
leaks (CVE-2008-3914).

various OpenBSD patches rolled in upstream. thanks to sturm@@
for looking over systrace.filter (needed for the test of sendmsg()
in configure to enable FD passing).
