Subject: [PATCH] bb #9017: tomsfastmath warning with zLinux on s390x

https://bugzilla.clamav.net/show_bug.cgi?id=9017

Only x86-64 is detected as a 64-bit arch which invalidates assumptions
made by the code (fp_digit must be half as long as fp_word). Better fix
would be to fix arch detection however for the purposes of clamav it's
easier to take upstream's diff verbatim.

1.1
log
@ClamAV 0.98 moved from libtommath to tomfastmath; however word-length detection
is broken on !amd64 64-bit arch which invalidates assumptions in the code.
Workaround by taking a diff from clamav upstream. This fixes a problem reported
by Markus Lude where freshclam signature checks fail - researched by him and
port diff from him (I just added a bit of commentary to the patch file).

log
@Now that sparc64 is fixed, update clamav in 5.4 to 0.98 as requested by jasper@@.
No direct security fixes, but improvements in the scanning engine make this a
desirable update.
