1.1
log
@update to clamav 0.98:

- signature improvements, performance improvements, support for new file
types including ISO9660, Flash, self-extracting 7z files

- more configurable limits

- callbacks added to API

while there, drop run dependency on zoo; clamav actually switched from zoo
to unzoo (which we don't have in ports) in 0.60(!) so this was doing nothing.

1.1.2.1
log
@Now that sparc64 is fixed, update clamav in 5.4 to 0.98 as requested by jasper@@.
No direct security fixes, but improvements in the scanning engine make this a
desirable update.
