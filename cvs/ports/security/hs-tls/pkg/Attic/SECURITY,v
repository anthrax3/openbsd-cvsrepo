@import hs-tls 0.3.1

Native TLS protocol implementation, focusing on purity and more
type-checking.
Currently implement the SSL3.0, TLS1.0 and TLS1.1 protocol. Not yet
properly secure and missing some features. Do not yet use as replacement
to more mature implementation.
Only RSA supported as Key exchange for now.
