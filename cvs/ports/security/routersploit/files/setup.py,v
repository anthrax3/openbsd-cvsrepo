The RouterSploit Framework is an open-source exploitation
framework dedicated for embedded devices.

It consists of various modules that aid penetration testing operations:

* exploits - modules that take advantage of identified vulnerabilities
* creds - modules designed to test credentials against network services
* scanners - modules that check if target is vulnerable to any exploit
