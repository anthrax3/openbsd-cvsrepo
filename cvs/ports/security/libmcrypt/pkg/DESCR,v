@libmcrypt is the library which implements all the algorithms and
modes found in mcrypt. It is currently under development but it
seems to work pretty good.

Unlike most encryption libraries libmcrypt does not have everything
(random number generators, hashes, hmac implementation, key exchange,
public key encryption etc.).  libmcrypt only implements an interface
to access block and stream encryption algorithms.

Its purpose was to assist in the development of mcrypt by providing
a uniform interface to access several different encryption algorithms,
so that the main program is independent of the encryption algorithms
and the modes used.

libmcrypt supports the algorithms: BLOWFISH, TWOFISH, DES, TripleDES,
3-WAY, SAFER-sk64, SAFER-sk128, SAFER+, LOKI97, GOST, RC2, RC6,
MARS, IDEA, RIJNDAEL-128 (AES), RIJNDAEL-192, RIJNDAEL-256, SERPENT,
CAST-128 (known as CAST5), CAST-256, ARCFOUR and WAKE.  Block
algorithms can be used in: CBC, ECB, CFB and OFB (8 bit and n bit,
where n is the size of the algorithm's block length).

@- upgrade to libmcrypt-2.4.9

NEWS:
- Due to an endianness handling problem Blowfish algorithm was not compatible
  with other implementations. Now it has been corrected. If you want
  to access the old algorithm used use the "blowfish-compat" module.
- Fixes in mcrypt_list_algorithms() for some systems. Bugs pointed out by
  Jonathan Woolmington <jwool@@ind.tansu.com.au>
- Fixes in stream mode.
- mcrypt_generic_init() no longer fails if smaller key is used. It uses
  the most appropriate key size of the algorithm and pads with zeros.
- Fixes in wake algorithm (and support for IV).
- IV is now used in arcfour (arcfour-iv is now longer used).
  Speedups in Arcfour.
