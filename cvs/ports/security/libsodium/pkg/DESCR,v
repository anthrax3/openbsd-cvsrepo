@NaCl (pronounced "salt") is a new easy-to-use high-speed software library
for network communication, encryption, decryption, signatures, etc.
NaCl's goal is to provide all of the core operations needed to build
higher-level cryptographic tools.

Sodium is a fork of NaCl with a compatible API. Unlike NaCl, Sodium
performs checks for hardware features at runtime instead of compile time,
making it suitable for packaging.
