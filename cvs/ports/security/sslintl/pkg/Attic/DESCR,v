@ssl-2.7-intl libcrypto and libssl libraries that includes the RSA algorithm.
*This version is for use OUTSIDE THE USA ONLY.* 

These two OpenBSD libraries (libssl and libcrypto, based on OpenSSL)
implement many cryptographic functions which are used by OpenBSD
programs like ssh, httpd, and isakmpd.  Due to patent licensing
reasons, those libraries may not be included on the CD -- instead the
base distribution contains libraries which have had the troublesome
code removed -- the programs listed above will not be fully functional
as a result.  Libraries which _include_ the troublesome routines are
in this package, and may be used as long as you meet the follow
(legal) criteria:
	  (1) Outside the USA, no restrictions apply. Use ssl-2.7-intl
	      (This package)
	  (2) Inside the USA, non-commercial entities may the install
	      the ssl-2.7-USA package which includes RSAREF (NOT this package).
	  (3) Commercial entities in the USA are left in the cold, due to how 
	      the licences work.  (This is how the USA crypto export policy
	      feels to the rest of the world.)
