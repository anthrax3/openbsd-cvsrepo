  aircrack is an 802.11 WEP and WPA-PSK keys cracking program that
  can recover keys once enough data packets have been captured.

  It implements the standard FMS attack along with some optimizations
  like KoreK attacks, thus making the attack much faster compared to
  other WEP cracking tools. In fact, aircrack is a set of tools for
  auditing wireless networks.

From Benoit Lecocq.

Note: aireplay-ng can cause kernel panics (as reported by David
Coppa), so this isn't yet connected to the build. But having it in
the tree may get some more people testing driver patches.
