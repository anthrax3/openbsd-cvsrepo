@Import sshlockout, a simple ssh brute-force blocker from DragonFlyBSD

Mentioned by Solene Rapenne, ok bcallah@@

pkg/DESCR:
sshlockout(8) will monitor the ssh syslog output and keep track of
attempts to login to unknown users as well as preauth failures. If
5 attempts fail in any one hour period, a permanent entry is added to
the pf(4) table for the associated IP address.
