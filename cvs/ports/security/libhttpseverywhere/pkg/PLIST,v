@Import libhttpseverywhere-0.4.1.

libhttpseverywhere leverages the power of HTTPSEverywhere
(https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere) for desktop applications. HTTPSEverywhere
is a browser plugin that comes with a set of rules that ensure that HTTP is used
instead of HTTPS only when this is absolutely not circumventable.
