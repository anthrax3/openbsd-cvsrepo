@Remove, in the way, not maintained......
This software had deprecated warnings for years and didn't manage to update
so kill it with fire.

@gnoMint is a tool for an easy creation and management of Certification
Authorities. It allows a fancy visualization of all the pieces that
conform a CA: x509 certificates, CSRs, CRLs...

Currently, it allows the creation of CAs, CSRs and Certificates, and
export both public and private parts of them into PEM formatted files.
It manages the revocation of the created certificates, as well as the
creation of CRLs.

gnoMint is now perfectly usable for managing a CA that emits
certificates able to:

    * Authenticate people or machines in VPNs (IPSec or other protocols);
    * Secure HTTP communications with SSL/TLS secured web servers;
    * Authenticate and cipher HTTP communications through web-client 
      certificates;
    * Sign and/or crypt e-mails
