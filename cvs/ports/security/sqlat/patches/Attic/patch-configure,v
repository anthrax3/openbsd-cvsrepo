@remove port that has been broken for a while, requires many changes
every time freetds is updated since it uses freetds' internal
functions directly instead of the sybase functions it emulates

1.1.1.1
log
@SQLAT is a suite of tools which could be useful for pentesting
a MS SQL Server. The tools are still in development but tend to
be quite stable.

The tools do dictionary attacks, upload files, read registry and
dump the SAM. They do this by wrapping extended stored procedures.
There is also a tool for doing a minimal analysis of a SQL Server
with output as HTML. You need to be 'sa' to run some of the tools,
but this usually isn't a problem.

The tool temporarily restores the xp_cmdshell if it is removed and
the dll is still left on the system.

SQLAT works over port 1433, it doesn't do named pipes. It doesn't
do integrated security either. This is because it is based on the
FreeTDS driver from www.freetds.org.
