@The Cyrus SASL (Simple Authentication and Security Layer)

SASL is the Simple Authentication and Security Layer, a method for
adding authentication support to connection-based protocols. To use
SASL, a protocol includes a command for identifying and authenticating
a user to a server and for optionally negotiating protection of
subsequent protocol interactions. If its use is negotiated, a security
layer is inserted between the protocol and the connection.

Available flavors:

  db - use the berkeley db library from databases/db

The library can use a Berkeley DB, gdbm or ndbm file on the server side to
store per-user authentication secrets.  The utility saslpasswd has been
included for adding authentication secrets to the file.
