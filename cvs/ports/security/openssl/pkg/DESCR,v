@Initial revision
@
text
@OpenSSL is an open-source toolkit implementing the Secure Sockets
Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols as well as a
full-strength general purpose cryptography library.

This package is not intended for general-purpose use in OpenBSD -
it is present to provide support for applications which cannot be made
compatible with LibReSSL (mostly due to use of removed APIs), and for
test/comparison purposes.

1.1.1.1
log
@Add a port for openssl-1.0.1h, carefully installing files outside of
standard paths searched for by third-party software to ensure that it's
not picked up by autoconf-type programs. This is not intended for general
use, but allows us to continue using specific software relying on APIs
which have been removed from LibReSSL, and for test/comparison purposes.

Various feedback from zhuk@@ and jca@@, earlier version ok zhuk@@ (with only
minor file/path shuffling since then).
