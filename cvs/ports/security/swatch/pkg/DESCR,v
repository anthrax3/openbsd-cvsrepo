@Swatch started out as the "simple watchdog" for activly monitoring log
files produced by UNIX's syslog facility. It has since been evolving
into a utility that can monitor just about any type of log.

Swatch was originally written to actively monitor messages as they
are written to a log file via the UNIX syslog utility. For a simple
demonstration type "swatch --examine=FILENAME" with FILENAME
being the file that you would like to see the contents of.  All
this example will do is demonstrate the different text modes that
are available with to the echo action.

@Update from 2.2 -> 3.0.1
It now FAKEs, and installs in a nice clean CPAN way

- CONFIGURE_STYLE is perl now, remove a lot of old manual code
- remove all old patches, and add in a new one which cleans up
  the program a bit (remove small linux specific hacks)

thanks to brad@@ for the review

SWATCH - The Simple WATCHer and filter
d8 1
a8 21
       Swatch is designed to  monitor  system  activity.   Swatch
       requires a configuration file which contains pattern(s) to
       look for and action(s) to do when each pattern is found.

      The file contains four TAB separated fields:

/pattern/[,/pattern/,...] action[,action,...] [[HH:]MM:]SS start:length

       A pattern must be a regular expression which perl(1)  will
       accept,  which  is very similar to the regular expressions
       which egrep(1) accepts.

       The following actions are acceptable:

       echo[=mode]
       bell[=N]
       exec=command
       ignore
       mail[=address:address:...]
       pipe=command
       write[=user:user:...]
