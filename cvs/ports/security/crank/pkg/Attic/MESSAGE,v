@crank no longer needs to run from the current working directory,
so axe docs on suggested runtime usage.

@
crank MUST be run from a directory where the plugins/ and data/
directories are present.

The recommended runtime configuration is to do the following:

% cd ./crank-lab
% ln -sf /usr/local/bin/crank .
% cp -Rp /usr/local/share/crank/{data,plugins} .
% ./crank
