@Update to nss 3.24, requirement of firefox 48.

- Remove patch-nss_lib_util_verref_h, merged upstream (#1226179)
- Remove useless patch-nss_coreconf_UNIX_mk, our -O2 takes precedence
- Remove chunk of patch-nss_coreconf_OpenBSD_mk, was merged upstream in
  #1250891. While here remove the addition of -Wl,Bsymbolic to MKSHLIB
which was here since forever for no justified reason.

@Update to nss 3.15.

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/NSS/NSS_3.15_release_notes

After years of sticking to CVS, upstream finally switched to hg,
changing its directory layout while here. All our patches are actually
unchanged, but got renamed/moved. CVS doesn't handle moves :)

Tested in an amd64 bulk build.
