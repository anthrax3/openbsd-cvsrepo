@Import libnettle-2.1.

Nettle is a cryptographic library that is designed to fit easily in more
or less any context: In crypto toolkits for object-oriented languages
(C++, Python, Pike, ...), in applications like LSH or GNUPG, or even in
kernel space. In most contexts, you need more than the basic
cryptographic algorithms, you also need some way to keep track of
available algorithms, their properties and variants. You often have some
algorithm selection process, often dictated by a protocol you want to
implement.
