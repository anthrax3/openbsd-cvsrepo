@John the Ripper is a fast and powerful password cracker. It combines several
cracking modes in one program, and is fully configurable for your particular
needs (you can even define a custom cracking mode using the built-in compiler
supporting a subset of C).

Out of the box, John supports (and autodetects) the following crypt formats:
standard and double-length DES-based, BSDI's extended DES-based, FreeBSD's
MD5-based and OpenBSD's Blowfish-based.

This package includes the "jumbo" patch of community enhancements, including
support for many additional hash and cipher types (including popular ones
such as NTLM, raw MD5, etc., and even things such as encrypted OpenSSH
private keys, ZIP and RAR archives, PDF files, etc.), as well as some
optimizations and features.
