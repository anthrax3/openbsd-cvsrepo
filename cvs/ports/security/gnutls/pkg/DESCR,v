@Long due update to GnuTLS 2.0.4, based on a submission by Giovanni Bechis.

Reformat DESCR, remove unneeded patches and LIB*ALIAS goo, reformat Makefile
Tested by many, thanks naddy for alpha, kili for zaurus and powerpc, okan
for amd64 and sparc64, sthen for sparc64 and others i forgot.
Ports depending on it have been vastly tested, thanks sthen for iksemel,
aanriot for prelude, Sebastian Reitenbach for heartbeat, and surely others.

@the MAINTAINER of this port was bad and used the wrong version of libtasn1 (too new),
and this breaks gnutls. Use the included copy of libtasn1 for now as a workaround.
