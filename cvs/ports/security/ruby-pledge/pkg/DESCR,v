@pledge exposes OpenBSD's pledge(2) system call to ruby, allowing a program to
restrict the types of operations the program can do after that point.  Unlike
other similar systems, pledge is specifically designed for programs that need to
use a wide variety of operations on initialization, but a fewer number after
initialization (when user input will be accepted).
