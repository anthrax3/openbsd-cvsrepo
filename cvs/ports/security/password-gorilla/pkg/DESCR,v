@The Password Gorilla helps you manage your logins. It stores all your
user names and passwords, along with login information and other notes,
in a securely encrypted file. A single "master password" is used to
protect the file. This way, you only need to remember the single master
password, instead of the many logins that you use.

If you want to log in to a service or Web site, the Password Gorilla
copies your user name and password to the clipboard, so that you can
easily paste it into your Web browser or other application. Because the
password does not appear on the screen, Password Gorilla is safe to use
in the presence of others.

The convenience of Password Gorilla allows you to choose different,
non-intuitive passwords for each service. An integrated random password
generator can provide one-time passwords, tunable to various services'
policies.

Password Gorilla is a Tcl/Tk application which can run on Linux and
Windows, and the files written are supposed to be compatible between
platforms. This is important for collaboration in heterogenous
environments.
