@Remove prelude. It's been unmaintained for years. Updating to a newer
version would require a lot of work and we have no maintainer; not to
mention the source code is not available right now.
A "security" software that is unmaintained is something that should live
in an attic.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------
| Running ${FULLPKGNAME} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

To start with prelude-manager, you have to create a starting profile,
e.g. "prelude-manager" by running:

# prelude-adduser add prelude-manager --uid=564 --gid=564

Then, alter prelude-manager.conf with your database settings (at least
"type", "host", "user" and "pass") according to the DBMS you selected
when installing libpreludedb; the type parameter can be either "pgsql",
"mysql" or "sqlite3".

If you are using sqlite, you need only two parameters, "type", and "file"
which indicates the location of the database file (/var/prelude/manager/
is the recommended directory to store this file).

To start prelude-manager at boot-time, you could use:

if [ -x ${TRUEPREFIX}/bin/prelude-manager ]; then
	/usr/bin/install -d -o _prelude -g _prelude -m 755 /var/run/prelude-manager/
	echo -n ' prelude-manager'; ${TRUEPREFIX}/bin/prelude-manager -d > /dev/null
fi

Note: the DBMS server to use with Prelude has to be started before.

@Add a consistent header that substitutes FULLPKGNAME for the READMEs.
