@Remove prelude. It's been unmaintained for years. Updating to a newer
version would require a lot of work and we have no maintainer; not to
mention the source code is not available right now.
A "security" software that is unmaintained is something that should live
in an attic.

| Running ${FULLPKGNAME} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

To start with prelude-lml, you have to create a starting profile,
e.g. "prelude-lml" by running on the manager side:

# prelude-adduser registration-server prelude-manager \
	--uid=564 --gid=564

and on the sensor side:

# prelude-adduser register prelude-lml "idmef:w" \
	<manager address> --uid 564 --gid 564

To start prelude-lml at boot-time, you could use:

if [ -x ${TRUEPREFIX}/bin/prelude-lml ]; then
	echo -n ' prelude-lml'; ${TRUEPREFIX}/bin/prelude-lml -d
fi
