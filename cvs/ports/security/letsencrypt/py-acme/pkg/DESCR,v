text
@ACME (Automated Certificate Management Environment) is a protocol for
automating the management of domain-validation certificates, based on a
simple JSON-over-HTTPS interface.

The spec (https://github.com/letsencrypt/acme-spec) is a work in progress
but it is hoped to eventually move it to the IETF process to become an RFC.

This packages provides a Python implementation of the protocol.
