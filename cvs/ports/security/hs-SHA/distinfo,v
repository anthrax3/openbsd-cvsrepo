@Import security/hs-SHA

This library implements the SHA suite of message digest functions,
according to NIST FIPS 180-2 (with the SHA-224 addendum), as well
as the SHA-based HMAC routines. The functions have been tested
against most of the NIST and RFC test vectors for the various
functions. While some attention has been paid to performance, these
do not presently reach the speed of well-tuned libraries, like
OpenSSL.
