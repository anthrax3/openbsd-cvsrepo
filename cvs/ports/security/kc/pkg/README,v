@Update to kc-2.3.2, from maintainer Levai Daniel.  Drop the run-deps on
p5-HTML-Parser which is only needed to run the pwsafe converter, and
document that in the README.  Remove redundant TEST_TARGET while here.

kc comes with a tiny and simple utility which can convert an exported
pwsafe database to a kc compatible XML database (that can be imported to
it later). It is installed under ${PREFIX}/share/kc/. Note that this
script requires Perl modules provided by the p5-HTML-Parser package.
