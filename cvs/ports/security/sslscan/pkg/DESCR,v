@Add a flavour providing a choice of which SSL library to build sslscan against.
@
text
@SSLScan queries SSL services, such as HTTPS, in order to determine the
ciphers that are supported. SSLScan is designed to be easy, lean and
fast. The output includes prefered ciphers of the SSL service, the
certificate and is in Text and XML formats.

Optional flavour: openssl - build against OpenSSL rather than LibreSSL,
allowing detection of SSLv2/v3.

@Import sslscan-1.8.2.

SSLScan queries SSL services, such as HTTPS, in order to determine the
ciphers that are supported. SSLScan is designed to be easy, lean and
fast. The output includes prefered ciphers of the SSL service, the
certificate and is in Text and XML formats.

Heavily based on the FreeBSD port.
