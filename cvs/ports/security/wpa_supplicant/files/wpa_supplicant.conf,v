@Patch wpa-supplicant to set DEFAULT_AP_SCAN 0, the scan code doesn't handle
OpenBSD. Remove ap_scan=0 from default config as suggested by / ok dcoppa.

README still mentions ap_scan=0; as discussed with tb@@ some institutions
provide sample config files which do include other ap_scan settings so
I think it's still helpful there.

@add a commented-out config line to help out with people who have auth servers
that don't like attempts to connect with TLSv1.1/1.2 (recent update moved from
using TLSv1.0 only).  ok dcoppa@@

@- update WPA-Supplicant to 2.0
- add OpenBSD WPA support written by kettenis@@ (also tested by matthieu@@
and Gregor Best)
- enable smartcard support via PCSC-Lite
- garbage collect OS compatibility patches which are no longer needed
(one found by me, one by kettenis@@)

1.1
log
@Add security/wpa_supplicant, a fully-featured implementation of an
IEEE 802.1X supplicant. This port does not support the wireless
WPA/WPA functionality yet, because it is missing in the OpenBSD
net80211 kernel implementation. Successfully tested with 802.1X on
ProCurve switches with OpenBSD running freeradius in the backend.

This port is based on work by Jussi Salzwedel, thanks!
