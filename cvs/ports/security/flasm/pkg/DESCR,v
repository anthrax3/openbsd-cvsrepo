@Flasm disassembles your entire SWF including all the timelines and
events. Looking at disassembly, you learn how the Flash compiler works,
which improves your ActionScript skills. You can also do some
optimizations on the disassembled code by hand or adjust the code as you
wish. Flasm then applies your changes to the original SWF, replacing
original actions.
