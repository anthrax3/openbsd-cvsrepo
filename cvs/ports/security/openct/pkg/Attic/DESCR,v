@openct to the Attic.
It's deprecated. OpenSC now uses pcsc-lite as its default backend.

@OpenCT implements drivers for several smart card readers. It comes as
driver in ifdhandler format for PC/SC-Lite, as CT-API driver, or as a
small and lean middleware, so applications can use it with minimal
overhead. OpenCT also has a primitive mechanism to export smart card
readers to remote machines via tcp/ip.

All recent usb readers most likely implement the CCID specification and
thus the generic USB CCID driver should work.
