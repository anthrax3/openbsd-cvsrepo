DESCRIPTION
       stel(1)  is intented to be a simple and practical plug and
       play solution for logging into a remote system or  execut-
       ing commands on a remote system.  stel offers a variety of
       features which range from mutual  authentication  to  file
       transfer.  The security of stel relies upon the underlying
       cryptographic desing, not trusting the  net  in  any  way.
       hostname  is the name of the remote system.  If no options
       are provided, stel defaults to triple DES encryption, 1024
       bits  Diffie  Hellman  modulus,  no protection from active
       attacks, and the remote system user's shell as the command
       to  be executed on the remote system.  This should be rea-
       sonable for most systems, and it is believed to be a  good
       compromise  between speed, ease of use and security.
