A manual is available at:
	http://la-samhna.de/samhain/manual/

By default, samhain uses the SRP (Secure Remote Password) protocol, with
a password that is embedded in the client binary, and a corresponding
verifier that is in the server configuration file.

To embed the password in the binary, there is a dummy password compiled in
as placeholder, and a utility called samhain_setpwd is provided which can
be used to change the embedded password.

For convenience, the server has functions to generate a random password
in the correct format.

Server side
===========

generate a random password in the correct format:
    $ yule -G

and generate a corresponding entry for the server configuration file:
    $ yule -P GENERATED_PASSWORD

The generated entry has a string 'HOSTNAME' that you should replace with
the fully qualified name of the client.
This entry must then be placed in the [Clients] section of the yule
configuration file.

Client side
===========

change the password in the samhain binary:
    $ samhain_setpwd ${TRUEPREFIX}/sbin/samhain signed GENERATED_PASSWORD

This command will create the ${TRUEPREFIX}/sbin/samhain.signed binary
which has to be used when you are connecting to the server.
