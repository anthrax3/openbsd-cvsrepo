@The YubiKey Personalization Tool is a Qt based cross-platform utility
designed to facilitate re-configuration of YubiKeys on Windows, Linux
and MAC platforms. The tool provides a sane simple step-by-step
approach to make configuration of YubiKeys easy to follow and
understand, while still being powerful enough to exploit all
functionality of both the YubiKey 1 and YubiKey 2 generations of
keys. The tool provides the same functionality and user interface on
Windows, Linux and MAC platforms.

The Cross-Platform YubiKey Personalization Tool provides the following
main functions:

* Programming the YubiKey in "Yubico OTP" mode
* Programming the YubiKey in "OATH-HOTP" mode
* Programming the YubiKey in "Static Password" mode
* Programming the YubiKey in "Challenge-Response" mode
* Checking type and firmware version of the YubiKey
