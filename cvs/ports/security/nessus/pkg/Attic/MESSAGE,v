@Some of the checks preformed by nessus rely on external programs
like hydra, nmap 3.00 or newer, and nikto.  You may want to 
install these ports to enable some checks which will otherwise
return false negatives.

If you have not already installed nmap 3.00 or a newer version
in ${PREFIX}/bin, you may wish to do so in order to enable some
checks which will otherwise return false negatives.
