@Foremost is a console program to recover files based on their headers,
footers, and internal data structures. This process is commonly referred
to as data carving. Foremost can work on image files, such as those
generated by dd, Safeback, Encase, etc, or directly on a drive. The
headers and footers can be specified by a configuration file or you can
use command line switches to specify built-in file types. These built-in
types look at the data structures of a given file format allowing for a
more reliable and faster recovery.
