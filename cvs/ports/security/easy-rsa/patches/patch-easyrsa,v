1.1
log
@update to easy-rsa 3.0.1.

The previous version was supposed to have been patched to use openssl
(instead of libressl) for ENV:: handling but this patch didn't work
correctly, and even with that fixed, there was an issue with easy-rsa
that caused generation to fail after the first certificate ("TXT_DB
error number 2"), which https://community.openvpn.net/openvpn/ticket/229
marks as WONTFIX for easy-rsa 2.x.
