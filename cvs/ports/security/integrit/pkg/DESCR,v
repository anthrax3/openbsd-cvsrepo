@integrit is an alternative to file integrity verification programs
like tripwire and aide. It helps you determine whether an intruder
has modified a computer system.

Its features include: 
* Small memory footprint during runtime.
  This is a big deal because a machine that is important enough to
  protect is probably doing important things. Since the other
  processes are important, integrit doesn't step on anyone's toes:
  its conservative with memory.
* Simple, modular design and implementation means a smaller learning
  curve and better potential for open-source development.
* Uses up-to-date cryptographic algorithms from gnupg.  
* Designed with unattended use in mind, e.g., integrit includes
  the MD5 checksum of newly generated databases in its report.
* Intuitive cascading rulesets for the paths listed in the
  configuration file.
* An option to reset the access times of selected files or directory
  trees after doing checksums.
* Output format can be XML or an easy-to-scan human-readable format.
* Simultaneous check and update: integrit can generate a new database
  while running a check against an old database.
* Distribution contains standalone auxiliary programs for convenience
  that you can safely ignore or else use when needed.
