@Update editors/ghostwriter 1.4.2 => 1.5

OK landry@@

port changes:
 - no need to @@sed VERSION as upstream stopped shelling out to git

upstream changelog:
---
New Features

* HUD windows can now be closed using the Esc key when they have focus.
* A new option has been added to highlight double spaces at the end of a line.
* Github-style task lists can now be made using the * and + bullet point
  characters, in addition to the - character.
* Support for ConTeXt and wkhtmltopdf when exporting to PDF with Pandoc has been
  added.
* Auto-matching characters for selected text now respects the existing preferences
  for the matching done while typing without text selected.
* Typing a single quote (') will no longer result in a second quote being
  automatically inserted after the cursor if the cursor is positioned in the
  middle of a word.
* Most settings have been moved into a new Preferences dialog to accommodate the
  ever increasing number of application options.
* Font size can now be increased by pressing Ctrl+=or decreased by pressing
  Ctrl+-. It can also be changed by using Ctrl and the mouse wheel.
* When exporting to other file formats, the output file will be opened after
  export with its default application.
* E-books created using Pandoc will now also be generated with a table of
  contents.
* When passing in a file path via the command line, a new file will be created
  with that path if it does not already exist.
* When typing a * character, ghostwriter would auto-insert a second * character in
  anticipation of emphasized text. The auto-inserted second * will now be removed
  if a space is typed to accommodate a bullet list instead.
* Rudimentary support for HiDPI has been added. See notes below.
* Various performance enhancements and tweaks have been made under the hood.

Fixes

* Issue #128: Hyphenated words are now considered one word for spell checking.
* Issue #131: ghostwriter can now be built from its source tarball without needing
  git to be installed.
* Issue #132: Linux desktop file now specifies that ghostwriter can open only one
  file from the command line rather than multiple files.
* Issue #170: Ctrl+M now opens the HTML Preview instead of Ctrl+W. This is to
  avoid a conflict with closing windows in Linux.
* Issue #219: Copy and paste no longer makes the word count jump.
* Sundry minor fixes have been added.

@Fix WANTLIB and bump REVISION for all ports depending on hunspell.

While here enforce dependency on hunspell 1.6 in mozilla.port.mk, as
it's a requirement for 53.
