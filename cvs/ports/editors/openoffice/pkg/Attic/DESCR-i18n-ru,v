1.1
log
@- add i18n support including 11 languages for now (if you need more, tell us)

- add a pseudo flavor called cleanobj that reduces the disk space needed
to build openoffice by cleaning up all unneeded object directories.
(idea from kurt@@)

- do not run checkdeliver.pl because it will fail if we use the cleanobj
flavor because it can't check the object dirs that we remove.
