1.1
log
@- add amd64 support
- use unxobsd.mk instead of different makefiles for every
  architecture
- use devel/boost now that we have it instead of the bundled
  one. (this is also needed to build openoffice on amd64)
- start using some patches from http://go-ooo.org/.
  (disable the startup wizard and some online registration menu points)
  (the patch is generated by my after applying the patches that's why
   i provide the mirror for it.)
- allow the openoffice build infrastructure to override our CFLAGS in
  some cases. this is needed because some of the files have to be compiled
  with -O0 instead of -02 which we use by default.
