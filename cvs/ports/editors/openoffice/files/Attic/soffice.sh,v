@- enable KDE integration and add openoffice-kde subpackge for this
optional feature
- enable building with java and add openoffice-java subpackage for this
optional feature. this corrects the "save as" problem and provides help
files in the base package. so now java is needed to build OOo but not to
run it. some OOo features require java to run, so install the
openoffice-java subpackage for that.
- make sbase, smath, setofficelang and spadmin applications available
via wrapper script.
- tweak configure to find versioned Qt shared libs.
- adjust include and lib search order again - sigh. put /usr/local
before jdk but after OOo dirs. this allows system libjpeg to be used
over jdk libjpeg and still avoids build conflicts with things like cppunit.
- remove extra patch to readlicense_oo/util/makefile.pmk

some testing and input ian@@ okay robert@@

@Import of OpenOffice.Org version 2.0.3m179.  
 
OpenOffice is an Open Source, community-developed, multi-platform office
productivity suite. It includes the key desktop applications, such as a
word processor, spreadsheet, presentation manager, and drawing program,
with a user interface and feature set similar to other office suites.
 
I would like to thank everyone who helped porting:
Peter Valchev, Kurt Miller, Dale Rahn, Ian Darwin and the OpenOffice.Org team.
 
This import is an explicit request by pvalchev@@ and espie@@.
This means that the current ports lock is still in effect and this import
is only a planned exception by the release managers.

This port is not yet connected to the builds.
 
okay pvalchev@@, espie@@
