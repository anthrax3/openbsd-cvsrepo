[1] NOT RECOMMENDED - XEmacs makes use of PNG files quite a lot.
[2] Works with LessTif and OpenMotif.
[3] Even if you don't use this flavor, XEmacs' uses a lesser efficient way
    to prevent this.  The method this flavor implements involves a world-
    writeable directory.

About XEmacs:

XEmacs (formerly known as Lucid Emacs) is a powerful, extensible text
editor with full GUI support, initially based on an early version of
GNU Emacs 19 from the Free Software Foundation and since kept up to
date with recent versions of that product.

Xemacs 21.1.2 port from <jean-yves@@burlett.org> plus minor tweaks.
This is basic xemacs, and needs the sumo tarball (or subset of
xemacs packages) for full functionality.
