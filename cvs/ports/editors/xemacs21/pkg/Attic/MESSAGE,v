@XEmacs is pretty useless as-is.  It is just an engine.
You need to install modules to provide your users full functionality.
There is two methods to achieve this :
1 - install the xemacs21-sumo package.  It contains all the 
    modules currently supported by the XEmacs team.
    It's fast, easy and your users won't ever bother you again about this.
    On the other hand the package is quite huge.
2 - you have to install by hand every XEmacs' modules as described
    in the XEmacs documentation. (Search for "packages" in the info tree.)
    There are a lot of interdependencies between XEmacs' modules
    and you may end up with everything installed just as method 1 would
    have (without the hassle).

Note: XEmacs modules are named "packages" by the XEmacs team, the term
      "module" is used here just to limit possible confusion with
      OpenBSD packages.

======================================================================
This package only installs XEmacs engine with very _basic_ functions.

You now have to install XEmacs packages to enable all its features.
XEmacs packages are commonly put in the /usr/local/lib/xemacs/
directory.

To create it, do the following (as root) :
install -d -g wsrc -m 775 -o root /usr/local/lib/xemacs

There are two ways to install packages :

1. You can  fetch a "sumo" tarball  containing  all supported packages
   for XEmacs      (prefered   way),   those    files    are     named
   'xemacs-sumo.tar.gz' and 'xemacs-mule-sumo.tar.gz' and are found in
   the packages/ directory of almost any XEmacs mirror.
   (like ftp://ftp.xemacs.org/pub/xemacs/packages/)

   Once   you   have    those  files    you    unpack    them in   the
   /usr/local/lib/xemacs  directory (you must be in  the group wsrc to
   do this). This creates  a xemacs-packages and, if  you use mule,  a
   mule-packages subdirectory in "/usr/local/lib/xemacs".

2. You can also use the   user-friendly package installation  frontend
   integrated into xemacs.  To do this,  run XEmacs being a  user with
   enough credentials to write into /usr/local/lib/xemacs and type :
	  M-x list-packages <RET> 

   You can then select packages with the 'return' key and install them
   with 'x'. Note that you must have access to ftp sites on the net to
   do this.

More info about packages can be found in XEmacs info tree :
type "info xemacs" to browse it.

Xemacs 21.1.2 port from <jean-yves@@burlett.org> plus minor tweaks.
This is basic xemacs, and needs the sumo tarball (or subset of
xemacs packages) for full functionality.
