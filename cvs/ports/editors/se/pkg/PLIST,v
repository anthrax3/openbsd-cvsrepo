@Import ports/editors/se. ok sthen@@

se is a screen oriented version of the classic UNIX text editor ed. It
has a full visual interface allowing you to see the text you're editing.
It's command syntax will be very familiar to users who already know ed.

Some of se's additional features are, a built-in help system,
configurable options that can be loaded from a startup file, the ability
to be ran interactively or via the included scriptse utility, and
optional usage logging.
