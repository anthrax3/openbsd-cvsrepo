1.1
log
@Updates from Donovan Watteau, who takes maintainer. From Donovan's mail:

* Fix a startup crash that's extremely easy to trigger on OpenBSD
  (patch-draw_c).

* Various fixes from a forked Github version (there was no official
  elvis release since 2004), clang warns about most of them.

* Remove some questionable/broken/dangerous features: backtick
  support in filenames, WYSIWYG for nroff/tex files, and
  HTTP/FTP support.  Looking at the code, I'd feel better having
  less features, here.  Please complain if you really want them.

* Remove dead FTP mirrors from MASTER_SITES, and use an HTTP server
  instead.

* Remove some previous patches of mine which only dealt with
  whitespace in man pages: fixing that was just useless noise.
