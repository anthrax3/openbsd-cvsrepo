log
@Various patches to editors/elvis, mostly from Debian, via Donovan Watteau:

- add --docdir so that :help works
- add --verbose
- fix a bug in the ")" command that could cause a segfault
- fix a bug when lauching elvis in a directory containing a "tags" dir
- make file/syntax detection work for scripts using "env"
- add "return" to the list of shell script keywords
- fix a few things in the man pages (\-, typo, whitespace) since
we were already patching them.
