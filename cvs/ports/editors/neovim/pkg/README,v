Why is the Escape Key Not Working Right?
========================================

If you use Neovim under tmux, you are likely being bitten by a libtermkey bug.
Read the libtermkey package README for a workaround.

Migrating from Vim to Neovim
============================

Note that in Neovim some paths are different from traditional vim. The config
dir is ~/.config/nvim, and the main config file is ~/.config/nvim/init.vim. You
can symlink your existing traditional vim config and directory to the new
paths, and this will work.

The first time you invoke nvim, run ':CheckHealth' to see what else you might
need to do to migrate.

Neovim is a project that seeks to aggressively refactor Vim in order to:

 * Simplify maintenance and encourage contributions.
 * Split the work between multiple developers.
 * Enable advanced external UIs without modifications to the core.
 * Improve extensibility with a new plugin architecture.

Tweaks suggested from abieber@@ and sthen@@.

OK abieber@@.

Thanks to upstream for addressing the issues I have been filing over the past
few months. All tests are now passing.
