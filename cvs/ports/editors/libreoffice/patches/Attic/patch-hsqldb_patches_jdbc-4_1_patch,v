log
@libreoffice has some internal patches, at least one of which doesn't get
applied correctly when using /usr/bin/patch, as worked-around in the previous
commit (by patching the patch). Since gnu patch does apply these successfully,
revert previous and switch to this instead, it should give fewer surprises
in the future.  ok robert@@
