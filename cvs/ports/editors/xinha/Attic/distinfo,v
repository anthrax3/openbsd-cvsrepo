@Remove old^unmaintained www apps. List was sent on ports@@ a week ago and
got no objection.
The main reason is that they don't add any value (basically an enhanced
tar xzf of upstream's tarball with nothing OpenBSD specific nor added
documentation) and that they are often left unmaintainned and outdated
in the tree which leads people to think they are still maintained while
they really are not.

@Initial import of Xinha 0.931

Xinha (pronounced like Xena, the Warrior Princess) is a powerful WYSIWYG
HTML editor component that works in Mozilla based browsers as well as in
MS Internet Explorer. Its configurabilty and extensibility make it easy to
build just the right editor for multiple purposes, from a restricted
mini-editor for one database field to a full-fledged website editor.
