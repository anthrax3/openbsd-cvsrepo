@The vi editor is one of the most common text editors on Unix. It
was developed starting around 1976 by Bill Joy at UCB, who was tired
of the ed editor. But since he used ed as a code base, access to
the original sources has required a commercial Unix Source Code
License for more than twenty years. In January 2002, Caldera was
so kind to remove usage restrictions to the Ancient Unix Code by a
BSD-style license and thus vi is now finally free.

This port of vi has generally preserved the original style, terminal
control, and feature set. It adds support for international character
sets, including multibyte encodings such as UTF-8, and some minor
enhancements that were not present in BSD vi 3.7, but had been
included in later vi versions for System V or in POSIX.2.
