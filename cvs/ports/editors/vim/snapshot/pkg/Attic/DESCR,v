@6.3 has been released. re-stub the snapshot of vim
@
text
@Vim is an almost compatible version of the UNIX editor Vi.  Many new features
have been added: multi level undo, syntax highlighting, command line history,
on-line help, filename completion, block operations, etc.  There is also a
Graphical User Interface (GUI) available.  See doc/vi_diff.txt.
 
This editor is very useful for editing programs and other plain ASCII files.
All commands are given with normal keyboard characters, so those who can type
with ten fingers can work very fast.  Additionally, function keys can be
defined by the user, and the mouse can be used.
 
Vim currently runs under Amiga DOS, MS-DOS, MS-Windows 95/98/NT, Atari MiNT,
Macintosh, BeOS, VMS, RISC OS, OS/2 and almost all flavours of UNIX.
Porting to other systems should not be very difficult.

Flavors:
        gtk        - build using the Gtk+ toolkit (default);
        gtk2       - build using the Gtk+2 toolkit;
	motif	   - build using the Motif toolkit;
	athena	   - build using the Athena toolkit;
	no_x11	   - build without X11 support;
	perl	   - build with Perl support;
	python	   - build with Python support;
	ruby	   - build with Ruby support;
	huge	   - build with --with-features=huge.

WARNING: This is an unstable version.  Most functionality should work fine, but
in some cases it might crash or even destroy your work.

If you run into something that doesn't work, please try to figure out why, try
to solve it and send me a patch.  If you can't do that, at least let me know
exactly how to reproduce the problem.

More info about the new 6.2 features with ":help version6-2".

If you don't like the syntax of a command, the name of an option or how the new
features work, let's discuss this in the vim-dev maillist.

text
@a14 5
Most of the fixes have already been tested by several people.  But there
might still be a few new problems, that's why this is a BETA version.
If there are no serious problems, the 6.1 release will follow in a
couple of weeks.

@heko@@ suggested that we could also build vim with maximum bloatage, so

1.3

@Add perl and python embedded support.

By default, they are not enabled.  To get a vim that is able to run natively
perl and/or python code, you must specify the appropriate FLAVOR tags.

I have tested those quite throughfully, but it might need some more testing.
