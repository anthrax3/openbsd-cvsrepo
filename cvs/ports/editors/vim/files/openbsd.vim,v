1.1
log
@- update to more recent vim patchset, using a self-rolled distfile (with
a maintainer convenience target to allow this to be updated easily from
Mercurial) - this beats downloading 750+ individual patch files and
trying to force them to apply during the build (which is problematic
because some require GNU patch and some have problems even then...)

- clean up plists greatly.

- remove m68k gcc patch.

- add openbsd.vim for style(9) from gsoares@@.

based on a diff from pirofti@@, ok pirofti@@ gsoares@@
