- nuke stable and snapshot branches after some discussions with a few people.

@Vim is an almost compatible version of the UNIX editor Vi.  Many new features
have been added: multi level undo, syntax highlighting, command line history,
on-line help, filename completion, block operations, etc.  There is also a
Graphical User Interface (GUI) available.  See doc/vi_diff.txt.
 
This editor is very useful for editing programs and other plain ASCII files.
All commands are given with normal keyboard characters, so those who can type
with ten fingers can work very fast.  Additionally, function keys can be
defined by the user, and the mouse can be used.
 
Vim currently runs under Amiga DOS, MS-DOS, MS-Windows 95/98/NT, Atari MiNT,
Macintosh, BeOS, VMS, RISC OS, OS/2 and almost all flavours of UNIX.
Porting to other systems should not be very difficult.

This subpackage contains the NLS files that allow Vim to display its messages
in various non-English languages.
