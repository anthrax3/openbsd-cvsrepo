@switch to new MULTI_PACKAGES
@
text
@Vim is an almost compatible version of the UNIX editor Vi.  Many new features
have been added: multi level undo, syntax highlighting, command line history,
on-line help, filename completion, block operations, etc.  There is also a
Graphical User Interface (GUI) available.  See doc/vi_diff.txt.
 
This editor is very useful for editing programs and other plain ASCII files.
All commands are given with normal keyboard characters, so those who can type
with ten fingers can work very fast.  Additionally, function keys can be
defined by the user, and the mouse can be used.
 
Vim currently runs under Amiga DOS, MS-DOS, MS-Windows 95/98/NT, Atari MiNT,
Macintosh, BeOS, VMS, RISC OS, OS/2 and almost all flavours of UNIX.
Porting to other systems should not be very difficult.

Flavors:
        gtk2       - build using the Gtk+2 toolkit (default);
	motif	   - build using the Motif toolkit;
	athena	   - build using the Athena toolkit;
	no_x11	   - build without X11 support;
	perl	   - build with Perl support;
	python	   - build with Python support;
	ruby	   - build with Ruby support;
	huge	   - build with --with-features=huge.

Vim is an almost compatible version of the UNIX text editor vi.  Only the 'Q'
command is missing (you don't need it).

Many new features have been added:
    multiple windows and buffers, multi level undo, command line history,
    filename completion, selection highlighting, block operations (including
    column/rectangular blocks), etc.

	an X-windows aware or a full X-windows GUI version can also be built
	that allows full use of the mouse and pull-down menus

Portability to all UNIX platforms, Amiga DOS, MS-DOS, MS-Windows NT, and
    Archimedes.
