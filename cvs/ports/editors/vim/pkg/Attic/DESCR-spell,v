@revert, for lots of technical reasons.
multi-packages are used when you have to build things together, but want
to separate the packages.

In this case, you have a bundle of things that do not even need to be
built together, that do not even share a MASTER_SITES, and were just bundled
because "they're related to vim".

This is deeply wrong. These files should be a separate port and packages.
Heck, they should be a separate port and several packages. Probably one
per-language.

@Vim is an almost compatible version of the UNIX editor Vi.  Many new features
have been added: multi level undo, syntax highlighting, command line history,
on-line help, filename completion, block operations, etc.  There is also a
Graphical User Interface (GUI) available.  See doc/vi_diff.txt.
 
This editor is very useful for editing programs and other plain ASCII files.
All commands are given with normal keyboard characters, so those who can type
with ten fingers can work very fast.  Additionally, function keys can be
defined by the user, and the mouse can be used.
 
Vim currently runs under Amiga DOS, MS-DOS, MS-Windows 95/98/NT, Atari MiNT,
Macintosh, BeOS, VMS, RISC OS, OS/2 and almost all flavours of UNIX.
Porting to other systems should not be very difficult.

This subpackage contains spell support files that allow Vim to do
spell-checking in various non-English languages.

@Add a -spell subpackage which if installed allows non-English languages
to be used with the spell checker.
