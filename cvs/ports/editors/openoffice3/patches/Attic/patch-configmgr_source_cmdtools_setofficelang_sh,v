@update to openoffice-3.1.0

- introduce a no_java flavor because now we can build OOo w/o having jdk and
  other java dependencies installed
- introduce a parallel flavor that allows people to build OOo with parallel
  processes. to achieve this we use a so called "non-blocking" cat, so
  another distfile has been added in order two provide to pre-built static
  binaries with the needed modifications (for amd64 and i386)
  By default we run a parallel build with NCPU+1 processes.
- remove unneccessary patch files
- fix some dependencies
