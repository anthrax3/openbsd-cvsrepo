@Maintenance update to 2.2.58.  Zile is now part of the GNU project.
@
text
@GNU Zile is a lightweight Emacs clone. Zile is short for Zile Is
Lossy Emacs.  Zile has been written to be as similar as possible
to Emacs; every Emacs user should feel at home.

Zile has all of Emacs's basic editing features: it is 8-bit clean
(though it currently lacks Unicode support), and the number of
editing buffers and windows is only limited by available memory and
screen space respectively.  Registers, minibuffer completion and
auto fill are available.  Function and variable names are identical
with Emacs's (except those containing the word "emacs", which instead
contain the word "zile"!).

Zile features:
    * Small. It is very useful for small footprint installations (like
      on floppy disk) or quick editing sessions.
    * 8-bit clean. Zile can operate with binary files.
    * Looks like Emacs. Most Zile key sequences and function names are
      identical to Emacs ones.
    * Multi buffer editing with multi level undo. The number of files
      and undo operations that Zile can handle is limited only by memory.
    * Multi window. Zile can display multiple windows on the screen.
    * Killing, yanking and registers. The standard killing, yanking and
      register features of Emacs are available under Zile.
    * Minibuffer completion. Zile can complete commands and filenames
      in the minibuffer.
    * Auto fill (word wrap). Zile automatically breaks the lines when
      they become too wide (if the Auto Fill Mode is enabled).

      This is very useful for M-x commands and for selecting files.

      if available.
    * Source highlighting (``C'', ``C++'', and shell scripts). Zile can
      highlight ``C'', ``C++'' source files and shell scripts for
      better reading.
