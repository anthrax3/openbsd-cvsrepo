GNU Moe is a powerful, 8-bit clean, console text editor for ISO-8859 and
ASCII character encodings. It has a modeless, user-friendly interface,
online help, multiple windows, unlimited undo/redo capability, unlimited
line length, global search/replace (on all buffers at once), block
operations, automatic indentation, word wrapping, filename completion,
directory browser, duplicate removal from prompt histories, delimiter
matching, etc.

Moe tries to rationalize the keyboard commands. The Alt key is used for
harmless commands like cursor movements and scrolling. The Control key
is used for more "dangerous" commands like copying text blocks, deleting
lines, or exiting. The Tab key is used for filename completion and also
shows/hides the directory browser when moe asks for a filename to save
or load. In any case, the unlimited undo/redo capability of moe makes
very difficult to accidentally cause an irreparable damage to your
files.

Moe uses the function keys, so that the most frequent commands can be
issued with only one finger. The function key F1 shows the online help,
and F10 allows you to change the options.
