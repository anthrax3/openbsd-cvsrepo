@GNU Emacs is a self-documenting, customizable, extensible real-time
display editor.

Users new to Emacs will be able to use basic features fairly rapidly
by studying the tutorial and using the self-documentation features.
Emacs also has an extensive interactive manual browser.  It is easily
extensible since its editing commands are written in Lisp.

GNU Emacs's many special packages handle mail reading (RMail) and
sending (Mail), outline editing (Outline), compiling (Compile),
running subshells within Emacs windows (Shell), running a Lisp
read-eval-print loop (Lisp-Interaction-Mode), automated psychotherapy
(Doctor :-) and many more.

Flavors:
          no_x11     - build without X11 support

@- Fold LEIM back into the parent Emacs port.
- Split LEIM and Elisp sources out into subpackages.

@Emacs 21.1 import

Some of you may opt to stick with 20.x, as this is a typical beginning of
a major rev.  Maintainership is directed my way, so feed patches to me.

Thanks to A B <obsdfaq30@@yahoo.com> for the submission.
