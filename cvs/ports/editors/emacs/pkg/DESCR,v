@- update to emacs 24.3

@GNU Emacs is an extensible, customizable text editor - and more. At its
core is an interpreter for Emacs Lisp, a dialect of the Lisp
programming language with extensions to support text editing. The
features of GNU Emacs include:

  - Content-sensitive editing modes, including syntax coloring, for a
    variety of file types including plain text, source code, and HTML.
  - Complete built-in documentation, including a tutorial for new
    users.
  - Full Unicode support for nearly all human languages and their
    scripts.
  - Highly customizable, using Emacs Lisp code or a graphical
    interface.
  - A large number of extensions that add other functionality,
    including a project planner, mail and news reader, debugger
    interface, calendar, and more. Many of these extensions are
    distributed with GNU Emacs; others are available separately.

This package now includes the Elisp source files previously available in
the emacs-el package.

Flavors:
	no_x11     - build without X11 support
	athena     - build with athena toolkit instead of gtk3
	gtk2	   - build with gtk2 instead of gtk3
	gtk3       - build with gtk3 (default)

GNU Emacs is a self-documenting, customizable, extensible real-time
display editor.

Users new to Emacs will be able to use basic features fairly rapidly
by studying the tutorial and using the self-documentation features.
Emacs also has an extensive interactive manual browser.  It is easily
extensible since its editing commands are written in Lisp.

GNU Emacs's many special packages handle mail reading (RMail) and
sending (Mail), outline editing (Outline), compiling (Compile),
running subshells within Emacs windows (Shell), running a Lisp
read-eval-print loop (Lisp-Interaction-Mode), automated psychotherapy
(Doctor :-) and many more.
