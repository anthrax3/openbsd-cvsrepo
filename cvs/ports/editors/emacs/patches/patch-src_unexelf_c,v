@Fix SIGBUS at unexec() step on sparc64.

Most likely due to the switch to binutils-2.17, emacs crashes with SIGBUS
at the loadup build step on sparc64, because it puts the section headers
at an unaligned address.

I am not sure whether this is the True Proper Fix.  Also, other strict
architectures ought to be affected too.  But let's at least provide
a working emacs package for sparc64 users at c2k15.

To be revisited laterwith feedback from upstream.

Problem reported by sthen/dlg/naddy.
